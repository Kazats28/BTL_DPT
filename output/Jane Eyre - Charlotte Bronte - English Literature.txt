<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I CONTINUED the labours of the village-school as actively

and



<P>faithfully as I could. It was truly hard work at first. Some time



<P>elapsed before, with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars



<P>and their nature. Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they



<P>seemed to me hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but



<P>I soon found I was mistaken. There was a difference amongst them as



<P>amongst the educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this



<P>difference rapidly developed itself. Their amazement at me, my



<P>language, my rules, and ways, once subsided, I found some of these



<P>heavy-looking, gaping rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls



<P>enough. Many showed themselves obliging, and amiable too; and I



<P>discovered amongst them not a few examples of natural politeness,



<P>and innate self-respect, as well as of excellent capacity, that won



<P>both my good-will and my admiration. These soon took a pleasure in



<P>doing their work well, in keeping their persons neat, in learning



<P>their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly manners. The



<P>rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even surprising;



<P>and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began



<P>personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me. I had



<P>amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,



<P>almost. These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught



<P>the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of



<P>needlework. I found estimable characters amongst them- characters



<P>desirous of information and disposed for improvement- with whom I



<P>passed many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes. Their



<P>parents then (the farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.



<P>There was an enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in



<P>repaying it by a consideration- a scrupulous regard to their feelings-



<P>to which they were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which



<P>both charmed and benefited them; because, while it elevated them in



<P>their own eyes, it made them emulous to merit the deferential



<P>treatment they received.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood. Whenever

I went



<P>out, I heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with



<P>friendly smiles. To live amidst general regard, though it be but the



<P>regard of working people, is like 'sitting in sunshine, calm and



<P>sweet'; serene inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray. At this



<P>period of my life, my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than



<P>sank with dejection: and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst

of



<P>this calm, this useful existence- after a day passed in honourable



<P>exertion amongst my scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading



<P>contentedly alone- I used to rush into strange dreams at night: dreams



<P>many-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the



<P>stormy- dreams where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure,



<P>with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still again and again met



<P>Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and then the sense of



<P>being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye, touching his



<P>hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him- the hope of passing



<P>a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first force and



<P>fire. Then I awoke. Then I recalled where I was, and how situated.



<P>Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering; and



<P>then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and



<P>heard the burst of passion. By nine o'clock the next morning I was



<P>punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the



<P>steady duties of the day.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me. Her

call at



<P>the school was generally made in the course of her morning ride. She



<P>would canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted



<P>livery servant. Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her



<P>purple habit, with her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed



<P>gracefully above the long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to



<P>her shoulders, can scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would



<P>enter the rustic building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of



<P>the village children. She generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers



<P>was engaged in giving his daily catechising lesson. Keenly, I fear,



<P>did the eye of the visitress pierce the young pastor's heart. A sort



<P>of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance, even when he did not



<P>see it; and when he was looking quite away from the door, if she



<P>appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming features,



<P>though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in their very



<P>quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger than



<P>working muscle or darting glance could indicate.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because

he could



<P>not, conceal it from her. In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she



<P>went up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even



<P>fondly in his face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn. He seemed



<P>to say, with his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with



<P>his lips, 'I love you, and I know you prefer me. It is not despair



<P>of success that keeps me dumb. If I offered my heart, I believe you



<P>would accept it. But that heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the



<P>fire is arranged round it. It will soon be no more than a sacrifice



<P>consumed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive



<P>cloud would soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand



<P>hastily from his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect,



<P>at once so heroic and so martyr-like. St. John, no doubt, would have



<P>given the world to follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him;



<P>but he would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the



<P>elysium of her love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise.



<P>Besides, he could not bind all that he had in his nature- the rover,



<P>the aspirant, the poet, the priest- in the limits of a single passion.



<P>He could not- he would not- renounce his wild field of mission warfare



<P>for the parlours and the peace of Vale Hall. I learnt so much from



<P>himself in an inroad I once, despite his reserve, had the daring to



<P>make on his confidence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to

my cottage.



<P>I had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or



<P>disguise: she was coquettish, but not heartless; exacting, but not



<P>worthlessly selfish. She had been indulged from her birth, but was not



<P>absolutely spoilt. She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could



<P>not help it, when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush

of



<P>loveliness), but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride



<P>of wealth; ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and



<P>unthinking: she was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer



<P>of her own sex like me; but she was not profoundly interesting or



<P>thoroughly impressive. A very different sort of mind was hers from



<P>that, for instance, of the sisters of St. John. Still, I liked her



<P>almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except that, for a child whom we



<P>have watched over and taught, a closer affection is engendered than

we



<P>can give an equally attractive adult acquaintance.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She had taken an amiable caprice to me. She said I was

like Mr.



<P>Rivers, only, certainly, she allowed, 'not one-tenth so handsome,



<P>though I was a nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel.' I



<P>was, however, good, clever, composed, and firm, like him. I was a



<P>lusus naturae, she affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure



<P>my previous history, if known, would make a delightful romance.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity,

and



<P>thoughtless yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the



<P>cupboard and the table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered



<P>first two French books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and



<P>dictionary, and then my drawing-materials and some sketches, including



<P>a pencil-head of a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars,



<P>and sundry views from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the



<P>surrounding moors. She was first transfixed with surprise, and then



<P>electrified with delight.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Had I done these pictures? Did I know French and German?

What a



<P>love- what a miracle I was! I drew better than her master in the first



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With pleasure,' I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight



<P>at the idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model. She had



<P>then on a dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her



<P>only ornament was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders



<P>with all the wild grace of natural curls. I took a sheet of fine



<P>card-board, and drew a careful outline. I promised myself the pleasure



<P>of colouring it; and, as it was getting late then, I told her she must



<P>come and sit another day.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver

himself



<P>accompanied her next evening- a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged,



<P>and grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a



<P>bright flower near a hoary turret. He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps



<P>a proud personage; but he was very kind to me. The sketch of



<P>Rosamond's portrait pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished



<P>picture of it. He insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend



<P>the evening at Vale Hall.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went. I found it a large, handsome residence, showing

abundant



<P>evidences of wealth in the proprietor. Rosamond was full of glee and



<P>pleasure all the time I stayed. Her father was affable; and when he



<P>entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong



<P>terms his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said

he



<P>only feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place,



<P>and would soon quit it for one more suitable.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed,' cried Rosamond, 'she is clever enough to be a

governess



<P>in a high family, papa.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any

high



<P>family in the land. Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers- of the Rivers



<P>family- with great respect. He said it was a very old name in that



<P>neighbourhood; that the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that



<P>all Morton had once belonged to them; that even now he considered



<P>the representative of that house might, if he liked, make an



<P>alliance with the best. He accounted it a pity that so fine and



<P>talented a young man should have formed the design of going out as a



<P>missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away. It appeared,



<P>then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of Rosamond's



<P>union with St. John. Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young



<P>clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as



<P>sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the 5th of November, and a holiday. My little servant,

after



<P>helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee

of



<P>a penny for her aid. All about me was spotless and bright- scoured



<P>floor, polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs. I had also made



<P>myself neat, and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour;

then I



<P>got my palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because



<P>easier occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature. The head



<P>was finished already: there was but the background to tint and the



<P>drapery to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe



<P>lips- a soft curl here and there to the tresses- a deeper tinge to the



<P>shadow of the lash under the azured eyelid. I was absorbed in the



<P>execution of these nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door



<P>unclosed, admitting St. John Rivers.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am come to see how you are spending your holiday,' he

said.



<P>'Not, I hope, in thought? No, that is well: while you draw you will



<P>not feel lonely. You see, I mistrust you still, though you have



<P>borne up wonderfully so far. I have brought you a book for evening



<P>solace,' and he laid on the table a new publication- a poem: one of



<P>those genuine productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate



<P>public of those days- the golden age of modern literature. Alas! the



<P>readers of our era are less favoured. But courage! I will not pause



<P>either to accuse or repine. I know poetry is not dead, nor genius



<P>lost; nor has Mammon gained power over either, to bind or slay: they



<P>will both assert their existence, their presence, their liberty and



<P>strength again one day. Powerful angels, safe in heaven! they smile



<P>when sordid souls triumph, and feeble ones weep over their



<P>destruction. Poetry destroyed? Genius banished? No! Mediocrity, no:

do



<P>not let envy prompt you to the thought. No; they not only live, but



<P>reign and redeem: and without their divine influence spread



<P>everywhere, you would be in hell- the hell of your own meanness.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of Marmion

(for



<P>Marmion it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing. His tall



<P>figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing. I looked up



<P>at him: he shunned my eye. I knew his thoughts well, and could read



<P>his heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I



<P>had then temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an



<P>inclination to do him some good, if I could.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With all his firmness and self-control,' thought I, 'he

tasks



<P>himself too far: locks every feeling and pang within- expresses,



<P>confesses, imparts nothing. I am sure it would benefit him to talk a



<P>little about this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to



<P>marry: I will make him talk.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I said first, 'Take a chair, Mr. Rivers.' But he answered,

as he



<P>always did, that he could not stay. 'Very well,' I responded,



<P>mentally, 'stand if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am



<P>determined: solitude is at least as bad for you as it is for me.



<P>I'll try if I cannot discover the secret spring of your confidence,



<P>and find an aperture in that marble breast through which I can shed



<P>one drop of the balm of sympathy.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is this portrait like?' I asked bluntly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Like! Like whom? I did not observe it closely.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You did, Mr. Rivers.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness:

he looked at



<P>me astonished. 'Oh, that is nothing yet,' I muttered within. 'I



<P>don't mean to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm



<P>prepared to go to considerable lengths.' I continued, 'You observed

it



<P>closely and distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at



<P>it again,' and I rose and placed it in his hand.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A well-executed picture,' he said; 'very soft, clear colouring;



<P>very graceful and correct drawing.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, yes; I know all that. But what of the resemblance?

Who is



<P>it like?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mastering some hesitation, he answered, 'Miss Oliver, I

presume.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course. And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate

guess, I



<P>will promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this



<P>very picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable



<P>to you. I don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an



<P>offering you would deem worthless.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked,

the



<P>firmer he held it, the more he seemed to covet it. 'It is like!' he



<P>murmured; 'the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are



<P>perfect. It smiles!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar



<P>painting? Tell me that. When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape,

or



<P>in India, would it be a consolation to have that memento in your



<P>possession? or would the sight of it bring recollections calculated

to



<P>enervate and distress?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,



<P>disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would

be



<P>judicious or wise is another question.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred

him, and



<P>that her father was not likely to oppose the match, I- less exalted

in



<P>my views than St. John- had been strongly disposed in my own heart



<P>to advocate their union. It seemed to me that, should he become the



<P>possessor of Mr. Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with



<P>it as if he went and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength



<P>to waste, under a tropical sun. With this persuasion I now answered-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious

if you



<P>were to take to yourself the original at once.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on

the



<P>table before him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung



<P>fondly over it. I discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at

my



<P>audacity. I saw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject

he



<P>had deemed unapproachable- to hear it thus freely handled- was



<P>beginning to be felt by him as a new pleasure- an unhoped-for



<P>relief. Reserved people often really need the frank discussion of



<P>their sentiments and griefs more than the expansive. The



<P>sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to 'burst' with



<P>boldness and good-will into 'the silent sea' of their souls is often



<P>to confer on them the first of obligations.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She likes you, I am sure,' said I, as I stood behind his

chair,



<P>'and her father respects you. Moreover, she is a sweet girl- rather



<P>thoughtless; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself



<P>and her. You ought to marry her.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Does she like me?' he asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Certainly; better than she likes any one else. She talks

of you



<P>continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon

so



<P>often.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is very pleasant to hear this,' he said- 'very: go

on for



<P>another quarter of an hour.' And he actually took out his watch and



<P>laid it upon the table to measure the time.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But where is the use of going on,' I asked, 'when you

are probably



<P>preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain

to



<P>fetter your heart?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't imagine such hard things. Fancy me yielding and

melting,



<P>as I am doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in



<P>my mind and overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have



<P>so carefully and with such labour prepared- so assiduously sown with



<P>the seeds of good intentions, of self-denying plans. And now it is



<P>deluged with a nectarous flood- the young germs swamped- delicious



<P>poison cankering them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the



<P>drawing-room at Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is



<P>talking to me with her sweet voice- gazing down on me with those



<P>eyes your skilful hand has copied so well- smiling at me with these



<P>coral lips. She is mine- I am hers- this present life and passing



<P>world suffice to me. Hush! say nothing- my heart is full of delight-



<P>my senses are entranced- let the time I marked pass in peace.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and

low: I



<P>stood silent. Amidst this hush the quarter sped; he replaced the



<P>watch, laid the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now,' said he, 'that little space was given to delirium

and



<P>delusion. I rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put



<P>my neck voluntarily under her yoke of flowers; I tasted her cup. The



<P>pillow was burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a



<P>bitter taste: her promises are hollow- her offers false: I see and



<P>know all this.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I gazed at him in wonder.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is strange,' pursued he, 'that while I love Rosamond

Oliver



<P>so wildly- with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the



<P>object of which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, and fascinating-

I



<P>experience at the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she



<P>would not make me a good wife; that she is not the partner suited to



<P>me; that I should discover this within a year after marriage; and that



<P>to twelve months' rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret. This I



<P>know.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Strange indeed!' I could not help ejaculating.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'While something in me,' he went on, 'is acutely sensible

to her



<P>charms, something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they



<P>are such that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to- co-operate



<P>in nothing I undertook. Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female



<P>apostle? Rosamond a missionary's wife? No!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you need not be a missionary. You might relinquish

that



<P>scheme.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Relinquish! What! my vocation? My great work? My foundation

laid



<P>on earth for a mansion in heaven? My hopes of being numbered in the



<P>band who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering



<P>their race- of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance- of



<P>substituting peace for war- freedom for bondage- religion for



<P>superstition- the hope of heaven for the fear of hell? Must I



<P>relinquish that? It is dearer than the blood in my veins. It is what

I



<P>have to look forward to, and to live for.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After a considerable pause, I said- 'And Miss Oliver? Are

her



<P>disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers:

in



<P>less than a month, my image will be effaced from her heart. She will



<P>forget me; and will marry, probably, some one who will make her far



<P>happier than I should do.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.

You are



<P>wasting away.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No. If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my

prospects,



<P>yet unsettled- my departure, continually procrastinated. Only this



<P>morning, I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I



<P>have been so long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three



<P>months to come yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters

the



<P>schoolroom.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again the surprised expression crossed his face. He had

not



<P>imagined that a woman would dare to speak so to a man. For me, I



<P>felt at home in this sort of discourse. I could never rest in



<P>communication with strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male



<P>or female, till I had passed the outworks of conventional reserve, and



<P>crossed the threshold of confidence, and won a place by their



<P>heart's very hearthstone.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are original,' said he, 'and not timid. There is something



<P>brave in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow

me



<P>to assure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions. You think



<P>them more profound and potent than they are. You give me a larger



<P>allowance of sympathy than I have a just claim to. When I colour,



<P>and when I shake before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself. I scorn the



<P>weakness. I know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I



<P>declare, the convulsion of the soul. That is just as fixed as a



<P>rock, firm set in the depths of a restless sea. Know me to be what I



<P>am- a cold, hard man.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled incredulously.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have taken my confidence by storm,' he continued,

'and now



<P>it is much at your service. I am simply, in my original state-



<P>stripped of that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers



<P>human deformity- a cold, hard, ambitious man. Natural affection



<P>only, of all the sentiments, has permanent power over me. Reason,



<P>and not feeling, is my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to



<P>rise higher, to do more than others, insatiable. I honour endurance,



<P>perseverance, industry, talent; because these are the means by which



<P>men achieve great ends and mount to lofty eminence. I watch your



<P>career with interest, because I consider you a specimen of a diligent,



<P>orderly, energetic woman: not because I deeply compassionate what



<P>you have gone through, or what you still suffer.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher,'

I said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No. There is this difference between me and deistic



<P>philosophers: I believe; and I believe the Gospel. You missed your



<P>epithet. I am not a pagan, but a Christian philosopher- a follower



<P>of the sect of Jesus. As His disciple I adopt His pure, His



<P>merciful, His benignant doctrines. I advocate them: I am sworn to



<P>spread them. Won in youth to religion, she has cultivated my



<P>original qualities thus:- From the minute germ, natural affection, she



<P>has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy. From the wild



<P>stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of the



<P>Divine justice. Of the ambition to win power and renown for my



<P>wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's



<P>kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the cross. So much



<P>has religion done for me; turning the original materials to the best



<P>account; pruning and training nature. But she could not eradicate



<P>nature: nor will it be eradicated "till this mortal shall put on



<P>immortality."'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table

beside my



<P>palette. Once more he looked at the portrait.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is lovely,' he murmured. 'She is well named the Rose

of the



<P>World, indeed!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And may I not paint one like it for you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cui bono? No.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which

I was



<P>accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the card-board from



<P>being sullied. What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was



<P>impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye. He took



<P>it up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at



<P>me, inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance



<P>that seemed to take and make note of every point in my shape, face,



<P>and dress; for it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning. His lips



<P>parted, as if to speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever



<P>it was.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is the matter?' I asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing in the world,' was the reply; and, replacing the

paper,



<P>I saw him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin. It



<P>disappeared in his glove; and, with one hasty nod and



<P>'good-afternoon,' he vanished.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well!' I exclaimed, using an expression of the district,

'that



<P>caps the globe, however!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on

it save



<P>a few dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.

I



<P>pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and



<P>being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon



<P>forgot it.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; SOPHIE came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed

in



<P>accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I



<P>suppose, impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come. She



<P>was just fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to

my



<P>hair with a brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Stop!' she cried in French. 'Look at yourself in the mirror:

you



<P>have not taken one peep.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure,

so unlike



<P>my usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger. 'Jane!'



<P>called a voice, and I hastened down. I was received at the foot of the



<P>stairs by Mr. Rochester.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Lingerer!' he said, 'my brain is on fire with impatience,

and



<P>you tarry so long!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all

over,



<P>pronounced me 'fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but



<P>the desire of his eyes,' and then telling me he would give me but



<P>ten minutes to eat some breakfast, he rang the bell. One of his lately



<P>hired servants, a footman, answered it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is John getting the carriage ready?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is the luggage brought down?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They are bringing it down, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman)

and the



<P>clerk are there: return and tell me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the

gates; the



<P>footman soon returned.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And the carriage?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The horses are harnessing.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready

the



<P>moment we return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped



<P>on, and the coachman in his seat.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, are you ready?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I rose. There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives

to



<P>wait for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I. Mrs. Fairfax



<P>stood in the hall as we passed. I would fain have spoken to her, but



<P>my hand was held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride

I



<P>could hardly follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel



<P>that not a second of delay would be tolerated for any purpose. I



<P>wonder what other bridegroom ever looked as he did- so bent up to a



<P>purpose, so grimly resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows,



<P>ever revealed such flaming and flashing eyes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending

the



<P>drive, I gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes;



<P>and both seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame. I wanted to see



<P>the invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to



<P>fasten a glance fierce and fell. I wanted to feel the thoughts whose



<P>force he seemed breasting and resisting.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was

quite



<P>out of breath. 'Am I cruel in my love?' he said. 'Delay an instant:



<P>lean on me, Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house

of God



<P>rising calm before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a



<P>ruddy morning sky beyond. I remember something, too, of the green



<P>grave-mounds; and I have not forgotten, either, two figures of



<P>strangers straying amongst the low hillocks and reading the



<P>mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones. I noticed them,



<P>because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of the



<P>church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle



<P>door and witness the ceremony. By Mr. Rochester they were not



<P>observed; he was earnestly looking at my face, from which the blood



<P>had, I daresay, momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and



<P>my cheeks and lips cold. When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked



<P>gently with me up the path to the porch.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited

in his



<P>white surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him. All was



<P>still: two shadows only moved in a remote corner. My conjecture had



<P>been correct: the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now



<P>stood by the vault of the Rochesters, their backs towards us,



<P>viewing through the rails the old times-stained marble tomb, where a



<P>kneeling angel guarded the remains of Damer de Rochester, slain at



<P>Marston Moor in the time of the civil wars, and of Elizabeth, his



<P>wife.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our place was taken at the communion rails. Hearing a cautious

step



<P>behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers- a



<P>gentleman, evidently- was advancing up the chancel. The service began.



<P>The explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and



<P>then the clergyman came a step farther forward, and, bending



<P>slightly towards Mr. Rochester, went on.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the

dreadful



<P>day of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed),



<P>that if either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be



<P>joined together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well



<P>assured that so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word



<P>doth allow, are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony



<P>lawful.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused, as the custom is. When is the pause after that



<P>sentence ever broken by reply? Not, perhaps, once in a hundred



<P>years. And the clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book,



<P>and had held his breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was



<P>already stretched towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to



<P>ask, 'Wilt thou have this woman for thy wedded wife?-' when a distinct



<P>and near voice said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of

an



<P>impediment.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute;

the clerk



<P>did the same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had



<P>rolled under his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his



<P>head or eyes, he said, 'Proceed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with

deep



<P>but low intonation. Presently Mr. Wood said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot proceed without some investigation into what

has been



<P>asserted, and evidence of its truth or falsehood.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The ceremony is quite broken off,' subjoined the voice

behind



<P>us. 'I am in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable



<P>impediment to this marriage exists.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn

and rigid,



<P>making no movement but to possess himself of my hand. What a hot and



<P>strong grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale,



<P>firm, massive front at this moment! How his eye shone, still watchful,



<P>and yet wild beneath!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Wood seemed at a loss. 'What is the nature of the



<P>impediment?' he asked. 'Perhaps it may be got over- explained away?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hardly,' was the answer. 'I have called it insuperable,

and I



<P>speak advisedly.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails. He continued,



<P>uttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.

Mr.



<P>Rochester has a wife now living.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had

never



<P>vibrated to thunder- my blood felt their subtle violence as it had



<P>never felt frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of



<P>swooning. I looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me. His



<P>whole face was colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint. He



<P>disavowed nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things. Without



<P>speaking, without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a



<P>human being, he only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to



<P>his side.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who are you?' he asked of the intruder.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you would thrust on me a wife?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which

the law



<P>recognises, if you do not.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Favour me with an account of her- with her name, her parentage,



<P>her place of abode.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Certainly.' Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket,

and



<P>read out in a sort of official, nasal voice:-



<P>date of fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield



<P>England, was married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter



<P>of Jonas Mason, merchant, and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at-



<P>church, Spanish Town, Jamaica. The record of the marriage will be



<P>found in the register of that church- a copy of it is now in my



<P>possession. Signed, Richard Mason."'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That- if a genuine document- may prove I have been married,

but it



<P>does not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still



<P>living.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She was living three months ago,' returned the lawyer.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How do you know?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you,

sir,



<P>will scarcely controvert.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Produce him- or go to hell.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will produce him first- he is on the spot. Mr. Mason,

have the



<P>goodness to step forward.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he



<P>experienced, too, a sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as

I



<P>was, I felt the spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through



<P>his frame. The second stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the



<P>background, now drew near; a pale face looked over the solicitor's



<P>shoulder- yes, it was Mason himself. Mr. Rochester turned and glared



<P>at him. His eye, as I have often said, was a black eye: it had now a



<P>tawny, nay, a bloody light in its gloom; and his face flushed- olive



<P>cheek and hueless forehead received a glow as from spreading,



<P>ascending heart-fire: and he stirred, lifted his strong arm- he



<P>could have struck Mason, dashed him on the church-floor, shocked by



<P>ruthless blow the breath from his body- but Mason shrank away and



<P>cried faintly, 'Good God!' Contempt fell cool on Mr. Rochester- his



<P>passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he only asked- 'What



<P>have you to say?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly. I

again



<P>demand, what have you to say?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir- sir,' interrupted the clergyman, 'do not forget you

are in



<P>a sacred place.' Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, 'Are you



<P>aware, sir, whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Courage,' urged the lawyer,- 'speak out.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is now living at Thornfield Hall,' said Mason, in

more



<P>articulate tones: 'I saw her there last April. I am her brother.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'At Thornfield Hall!' ejaculated the clergyman. 'Impossible!

I am



<P>an old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a



<P>Mrs. Rochester at Thornfield Hall.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he

muttered-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, by God! I took care that none should hear of it- or

of her



<P>under that name.' He mused- for ten minutes he held counsel with



<P>himself: he formed his resolve, and announced it-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from

the



<P>barrel. Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green



<P>(to the clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day.'



<P>The man obeyed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: 'Bigamy

is an ugly



<P>word!- I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred



<P>me, or Providence has checked me,- perhaps the last. I am little



<P>better than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell



<P>me, deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the



<P>quenchless fire and deathless worm. Gentlemen, my plan is broken



<P>up:- what this lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married,



<P>and the woman to whom I was married lives! You say you never heard



<P>of a Mrs. Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you



<P>have many a time inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious



<P>lunatic kept there under watch and ward. Some have whispered to you



<P>that she is my bastard half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress. I



<P>now inform you that she is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,-



<P>Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute personage, who is now,



<P>with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing you what a stout



<P>heart men may bear. Cheer up, Dick!- never fear me!- I'd almost as



<P>soon strike a woman as you. Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad



<P>family; idiots and maniacs through three generations! Her mother,



<P>the Creole, was both a mad-woman and a drunkard!- as I found out after



<P>I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets before.



<P>Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points. I



<P>had a charming partner- pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a



<P>happy man. I went through rich scenes! Oh! my experience has been



<P>heavenly, if you only knew it! But I owe you no further explanation.



<P>Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and



<P>visit Mrs. Poole's patient, and my wife! You shall see what sort of



<P>a being I was cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had

a



<P>right to break the compact, and seek sympathy with something at



<P>least human. This girl,' he continued, looking at me, 'knew no more



<P>than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and



<P>legal, and never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into a feigned



<P>union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and



<P>embruted partner! Come all of you- follow!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen

came



<P>after. At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take it back to the coach-house, John,' said Mr. Rochester

coolly:



<P>'it will not be wanted to-day.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced

to



<P>meet and greet us.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To the right-about- every soul!' cried the master; 'away

with your



<P>congratulations! Who wants them? Not I!- they are fifteen years too



<P>late!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my

hand, and



<P>still beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did. We



<P>mounted the first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the



<P>third storey: the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's



<P>master-key, admitted us to the tapestried room, with its great bed and



<P>its pictorial cabinet.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You know this place, Mason,' said our guide; 'she bit

and



<P>stabbed you here.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second

door:



<P>this, too, he opened. In a room without a window, there burnt a fire



<P>guarded by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the



<P>ceiling by a chain. Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking



<P>something in a saucepan. In the deep shade, at the farther end of



<P>the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether



<P>beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell: it



<P>grovelled, seemingly, on all fours; it snatched and growled like



<P>some strange wild animal: but it was covered with clothing, and a



<P>quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and



<P>face.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!' said Mr. Rochester. 'How are

you? and



<P>how is your charge to-day?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We're tolerable, sir, I thank you,' replied Grace, lifting

the



<P>boiling mess carefully on to the hob: 'rather snappish, but not



<P>'rageous.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report:

the



<P>clothed hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! sir, she sees you!' exclaimed Grace: 'you'd better

not stay.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take care then, sir!- for God's sake, take care!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her

visage,



<P>and gazed wildly at her visitors. I recognised well that purple face,-



<P>those bloated features. Mrs. Poole advanced.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Keep out of the way,' said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her

aside:



<P>'she has no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning:

it is not in



<P>mortal discretion to fathom her craft.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We had better leave her,' whispered Mason.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go to the devil!' was his brother-in-law's recommendation.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; ''Ware!' cried Grace. The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.



<P>Mr. Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his



<P>throat viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled. She



<P>was a big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and



<P>corpulent besides: she showed virile force in the contest- more than



<P>once she almost throttled him, athletic as he was. He could have



<P>settled her with a well-planted blow: but he would not strike: he



<P>would only wrestle. At last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him



<P>a cord, and he pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which was



<P>at hand, he bound her to a chair. The operation was performed amidst



<P>the fiercest yells and the most convulsive plunges. Mr. Rochester then



<P>turned to the spectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid



<P>and desolate.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is my wife,' said he. 'Such is the sole conjugal

embrace I am



<P>ever to know- such are the endearments which are to solace my



<P>leisure hours! And this is what I wished to have' (laying his hand



<P>on my shoulder): 'this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at



<P>the mouth of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon. I



<P>wanted her just as a change after that fierce ragout. Wood and Briggs,



<P>look at the difference! Compare these clear eyes with the red balls



<P>yonder- this face with that mask- this form with that bulk; then judge



<P>me, priest of the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what



<P>judgment ye judge ye shall be judged! Off with you now. I must shut

up



<P>my prize.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We all withdrew. Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us,

to give



<P>some further order to Grace Poole. The solicitor addressed me as he



<P>descended the stair.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You, madam,' said he, 'are cleared from all blame: your

uncle will



<P>be glad to hear it- if, indeed, he should be still living- when Mr.



<P>Mason returns to Madeira.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My uncle! What of him? Do you know him?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Mason does. Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent

of his



<P>house for some years. When your uncle received your letter



<P>intimating the contemplated union between yourself and Mr.



<P>Rochester, Mr. Mason, who was staying at Madeira to recruit his



<P>health, on his way back to Jamaica, happened to be with him. Mr.



<P>Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he knew that my client here was



<P>acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Rochester. Mr. Mason,



<P>astonished and distressed as you may suppose, revealed the real



<P>state of matters. Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is now on a sick-bed;



<P>from which, considering the nature of his disease- decline- and the



<P>stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will ever rise. He could not



<P>then hasten to England himself, to extricate you from the snare into



<P>which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in



<P>taking steps to prevent the false marriage. He referred him to me



<P>for assistance. I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not too



<P>late: as you, doubtless, must be also. Were I not morally certain that



<P>your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to



<P>accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better



<P>remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr.



<P>Eyre. Have we anything else to stay for?' he inquired of Mr. Mason.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, no- let us be gone,' was the anxious reply; and without



<P>waiting to take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the



<P>hall door. The clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either

of



<P>admonition or reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done,



<P>he too departed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own

room,



<P>to which I had now withdrawn. The house cleared, I shut myself in,



<P>fastened the bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded- not to weep,



<P>not to mourn, I was yet too calm for that, but- mechanically to take



<P>off the wedding-dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn



<P>yesterday, as I thought, for the last time. I then sat down: I felt



<P>weak and tired. I leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on



<P>them. And now I thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved-



<P>followed up and down where I was led or dragged- watched event rush

on



<P>event, disclosure open beyond disclosure: but now, I thought.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning had been a quiet morning enough- all except

the brief



<P>scene with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been



<P>noisy; there was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no



<P>dispute, no defiance or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words



<P>had been spoken, a calmly pronounced objection to the marriage made;



<P>some stern, short questions put by Mr. Rochester; answers,



<P>explanations given, evidence adduced; an open admission of the truth



<P>had been uttered by my master; then the living proof had been seen;



<P>the intruders were gone, and all was over.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in my own room as usual- just myself, without obvious

change:



<P>nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me. And yet where was



<P>the Jane Eyre of yesterday?- where was her life?- where were her



<P>prospects?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman- almost

a bride,



<P>was a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were



<P>desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December



<P>storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts



<P>crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen



<P>shroud: lanes which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were



<P>pathless with untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours



<P>since waved leafy and fragrant as groves between the tropics, now



<P>spread, waste, wild, and white as pine-forests in wintry Norway. My



<P>hopes were all dead- struck with a subtle doom, such as, in one night,



<P>fell on all the first-born in the land of Egypt. I looked on my



<P>cherished wishes, yesterday so blooming and glowing; they lay stark,



<P>chill, livid corpses that could never revive. I looked at my love:



<P>that feeling which was my master's- which he had created; it



<P>shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle;



<P>sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr.



<P>Rochester's arms- it could not derive warmth from his breast. Oh,



<P>never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted- confidence



<P>destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was



<P>not what I had thought him. I would not ascribe vice to him; I would



<P>not say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was



<P>gone from his idea, and from his presence I must go: that I



<P>perceived well. When- how- whither, I could not yet discern; but he



<P>himself, I doubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield. Real



<P>affection, it seemed, he could not have for me; it had been only



<P>fitful passion: that was balked; he would want me no more. I should



<P>fear even to cross his path now: my view must be hateful to him. Oh,



<P>how blind had been my eyes! How weak my conduct!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed

to swim



<P>round me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.



<P>Self-abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down



<P>in the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in



<P>remote mountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will,

to



<P>flee I had no strength. I lay faint, longing to be dead. One idea only



<P>still throbbed life-like within me- a remembrance of God: it begot



<P>an unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my



<P>rayless mind, as something that should be whispered, but no energy was



<P>found to express them-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none

to help.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven

to avert it-



<P>as I had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my



<P>lips- it came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me. The



<P>whole consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched,



<P>my faith death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen



<P>mass. That bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, 'the waters came



<P>into my soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing: I came into



<P>deep waters; the floods overflowed me.'

CHAPTER XXVII</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; SOME time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking

round



<P>and seeing the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the



<P>wall, I asked, 'What am I to do?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the answer my mind gave- 'Leave Thornfield at once'-

was so



<P>prompt, so dread, that I stopped my ears. I said I could not bear such



<P>words now. 'That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part



<P>of my woe,' I alleged: 'that I have wakened out of most glorious



<P>dreams, and found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and



<P>master; but that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is



<P>intolerable. I cannot do it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it

and



<P>foretold that I should do it. I wrestled with my own resolution: I



<P>wanted to be weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further



<P>suffering I saw laid out for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held



<P>Passion by the throat, told her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her



<P>dainty foot in the slough, and swore that with that arm of iron he



<P>would thrust her down to unsounded depths of agony.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let me be torn away, then!' I cried. 'Let another help

me!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you:

you shall



<P>yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand:



<P>your heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which

so ruthless



<P>a judge haunted,- at the silence which so awful a voice filled. My



<P>head swam as I stood erect. I perceived that I was sickening from



<P>excitement and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips



<P>that day, for I had taken no breakfast. And, with a strange pang, I



<P>now reflected that, long as I had been shut up here, no message had



<P>been sent to ask how I was, or to invite me to come down: not even



<P>little Adele had tapped at the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had



<P>sought me. 'Friends always forget those whom fortune forsakes,' I



<P>murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed out. I stumbled over an



<P>obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was dim, and my limbs were



<P>feeble. I could not soon recover myself. I fell, but not on to the



<P>ground; an outstretched arm caught me. I looked up- I was supported

by



<P>Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber threshold.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You come out at last,' he said. 'Well, I have been waiting

for you



<P>long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob:



<P>five minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced



<P>the lock like a burglar. So you shun me?- you shut yourself up and



<P>grieve alone! I would rather you had come and upbraided me with



<P>vehemence. You are passionate: I expected a scene of some kind. I



<P>was prepared for the hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be



<P>shed on my breast: now a senseless floor has received them, or your



<P>drenched handkerchief. But I err: you have not wept at all! I see a



<P>white cheek and a faded eye, but no trace of tears. I suppose, then,



<P>your heart has been weeping blood?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, Jane! not a word of reproach? Nothing bitter- nothing



<P>poignant? Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion? You sit quietly



<P>where I have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I never meant to wound you thus. If the man who

had but



<P>one little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of



<P>his bread and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some



<P>mistake slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his



<P>bloody blunder more than I now rue mine. Will you ever forgive me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot. There

was such



<P>deep remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy



<P>in his manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole



<P>look and mien- I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly;



<P>only at my heart's core.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?' ere long he inquired



<P>wistfully- wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,



<P>the result rather of weakness than of will.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then tell me so roundly and sharply- don't spare me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot: I am tired and sick. I want some water.' He

heaved a



<P>sort of shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me



<P>downstairs. At first I did not know to what room he had borne me;



<P>all was cloudy to my glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving



<P>warmth of a fire; for, summer as it was, I had become icy cold in my



<P>chamber. He put wine to my lips; I tasted it and revived; then I ate



<P>something he offered me, and was soon myself. I was in the library-



<P>sitting in his chair- he was quite near. 'If I could go out of life



<P>now, without too sharp a pang, it would be well for me,' I thought;



<P>'then I should not have to make the effort of cracking my



<P>heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's. I must leave



<P>him, it appears. I do not want to leave him- I cannot leave him.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How are you now, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Much better, sir; I shall be well soon.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Taste the wine again, Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood

before



<P>me, and looked at me attentively. Suddenly he turned away, with an



<P>inarticulate exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind;



<P>he walked fast through the room and came back; he stooped towards me



<P>as if to kiss me; but I remembered caresses were now forbidden. I



<P>turned my face away and put his aside.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What!- How is this?' he exclaimed hastily. 'Oh, I know!

you



<P>won't kiss the husband of Bertha Mason? You consider my arms filled



<P>and my embraces appropriated?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, Jane? I will spare you the trouble of much talking;

I will



<P>answer for you- Because I have a wife already, you would reply.- I



<P>guess rightly?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me;

you must



<P>regard me as a plotting profligate- a base and low rake who has been



<P>simulating disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare



<P>deliberately laid, and strip you of honour and rob you of



<P>self-respect. What do you say to that? I see you can say nothing: in



<P>the first place, you are faint still, and have enough to do to draw



<P>your breath; in the second place, you cannot yet accustom yourself



<P>to accuse and revile me, and besides, the flood-gates of tears are



<P>opened, and they would rush out if you spoke much; and you have no



<P>desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene: you are thinking



<P>how to act- talking you consider is of no use. I know you- I am on



<P>my guard.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, I do not wish to act against you,' I said; and my

unsteady



<P>voice warned me to curtail my sentence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming

to



<P>destroy me. You have as good as said that I am a married man- as a



<P>married man you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have



<P>refused to kiss me. You intend to make yourself a complete stranger

to



<P>me: to live under this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say

a



<P>friendly word to you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again

to



<P>me, you will say,- "That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must



<P>be ice and rock to him"; and ice and rock you will accordingly



<P>become.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: 'All is changed

about me,



<P>sir; I must change too- there is no doubt of that; and to avoid



<P>fluctuations of feeling, and continual combats with recollections



<P>and associations, there is only one way- Adele must have a new



<P>governess, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, Adele will go to school- I have settled that already;

nor do I



<P>mean to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections

of



<P>Thornfield Hall- this accursed place- this tent of Achan- this



<P>insolent vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the



<P>light of the open sky- this narrow stone hell, with its one real



<P>fiend, worse than a legion of such as we imagine. Jane, you shall



<P>not stay here, nor will I. I was wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield



<P>Hall, knowing as I did how it was haunted. I charged them to conceal



<P>from you, before I ever saw you, all knowledge of the curse of the



<P>place; merely because I feared Adele never would have a governess to



<P>stay if she knew with what inmate she was housed, and my plans would



<P>not permit me to remove the maniac elsewhere- though I possess an



<P>old house, Ferndean Manor, even more retired and hidden than this,



<P>where I could have lodged her safely enough, had not a scruple about



<P>the unhealthiness of the situation, in the heart of a wood, made my



<P>conscience recoil from the arrangement. Probably those damp walls



<P>would soon have eased me of her charge: but to each villain his own



<P>vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect assassination, even of



<P>what I most hate.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however,

was



<P>something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near

a



<P>upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was. But I'll



<P>shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the



<P>lower windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here



<P>with my wife, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for



<P>money, and she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to



<P>bear her company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when



<P>my wife is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at



<P>night, to stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir,' I interrupted him, 'you are inexorable for that



<P>unfortunate lady: you speak of her with hate- with vindictive



<P>antipathy. It is cruel- she cannot help being mad.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you

are),



<P>you don't know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it



<P>is not because she is mad I hate her. If you were mad, do you think



<P>I should hate you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do indeed, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me,

and



<P>nothing about the sort of love of which I am capable. Every atom of



<P>your flesh is as dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would



<P>still be dear. Your mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it



<P>would be my treasure still: if you raved, my arms should confine



<P>you, and not a strait waistcoat- your grasp, even in fury, would



<P>have a charm for me: if you flew at me as wildly as that woman did



<P>this morning, I should receive you in an embrace, at least as fond



<P>as it would be restrictive. I should not shrink from you with



<P>disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you should have no



<P>watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you with untiring



<P>tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and never weary



<P>of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of



<P>recognition for me.- But why do I follow that train of ideas? I was



<P>talking of removing you from Thornfield. All, you know, is prepared



<P>for prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go. I only ask you to endure



<P>one more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its



<P>miseries and terrors for ever! I have a place to repair to, which will



<P>be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome



<P>intrusion- even from falsehood and slander.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And take Adele with you, sir,' I interrupted; 'she will

be a



<P>companion for you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do you mean, Jane? I told you I would send Adele

to school;



<P>and what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own



<P>child,- a French dancer's bastard? Why do you importune me about



<P>her! I say, why do you assign Adele to me for a companion?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude

are



<P>dull: too dull for you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Solitude! solitude!' he reiterated with irritation. 'I

see I



<P>must come to an explanation. I don't know what sphynx-like



<P>expression is forming in your countenance. You are to share my



<P>solitude. Do you understand?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited

as he was



<P>becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent. He had been



<P>walking fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted



<P>to one spot. He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him,



<P>fixed them on the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet,



<P>collected aspect.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now for the hitch in Jane's character,' he said at last,



<P>speaking more calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.



<P>'The reel of silk has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew



<P>there would come a knot and a puzzle: here it is. Now for vexation,



<P>and exasperation, and endless trouble! By God! I long to exert a



<P>fraction of Samson's strength, and break the entanglement like tow!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this

time just



<P>before me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane! will you hear reason?' (he stooped and approached

his lips



<P>to my ear); 'because, if you won't, I'll try violence. His voice was



<P>hoarse; his look that of a man who is just about to burst an



<P>insufferable bond and plunge headlong into wild license. I saw that

in



<P>another moment, and with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be



<P>able to do nothing with him. The present- the passing second of



<P>time- was all I had in which to control and restrain him: a movement



<P>of repulsion, flight, fear would have sealed my doom,- and his. But



<P>I was not afraid: not in the least. I felt an inward power; a sense

of



<P>influence, which supported me. The crisis was perilous; but not



<P>without its charm: such as the Indian, perhaps, feels when he slips



<P>over the rapid in his canoe. I took hold of his clenched hand,



<P>loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him, soothingly-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear

all you



<P>have to say, whether reasonable or unreasonable.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.

I had been



<P>struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to



<P>repress them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep. Now,



<P>however, I considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long



<P>as they liked. If the flood annoyed him, so much the better. So I gave



<P>way and cried heartily.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.

I said I



<P>could not while he was in such a passion.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and

you had



<P>steeled your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I



<P>could not endure it. Hush, now, and wipe your eyes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I,

in my turn,



<P>became calm. Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder,



<P>but I would not permit it. Then he would draw me to him: no.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane! Jane!' he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness

it



<P>thrilled along every nerve I had; 'you don't love me, then? It was



<P>only my station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued? Now that



<P>you think me disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my



<P>touch as if I were some toad or ape.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; These words cut me: yet what could I do or say? I ought

probably to



<P>have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse



<P>at thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop



<P>balm where I had wounded.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do love you,' I said, 'more than ever: but I must not

show or



<P>indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The last time, Jane! What! do you think you can live with

me,



<P>and see me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and



<P>distant?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore

I see



<P>there is but one way: but you will be furious if I mention it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, mention it! If I storm, you have the art of weeping.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, I must leave you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For how long, Jane? For a few minutes, while you smooth

your hair-



<P>which is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face- which looks



<P>feverish?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I must leave Adele and Thornfield. I must part with you

for my



<P>whole life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and



<P>strange scenes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course: I told you you should. I pass over the madness

about



<P>parting from me. You mean you must become a part of me. As to the



<P>new existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not



<P>married. You shall be Mrs. Rochester- both virtually and nominally.



<P>I shall keep only to you so long as you and I live. You shall go to



<P>a place I have in the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the



<P>shores of the Mediterranean. There you shall live a happy, and



<P>guarded, and most innocent life. Never fear that I wish to lure you



<P>into error- to make you my mistress. Why did you shake your head?



<P>Jane, you must be reasonable, or in truth I shall again become



<P>frantic.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated;

his eye



<P>blazed: still I dared to speak.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged

this morning



<P>by yourself. If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be



<P>your mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical- is false.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man- you forget that:

I am not



<P>long-enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate. Out of pity to me



<P>and yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and-



<P>beware!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was

forsaking



<P>his cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all



<P>hands. To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was



<P>cruel: to yield was out of the question. I did what human beings do



<P>instinctively when they are driven to utter extremity- looked for



<P>aid to one higher than man: the words 'God help me!' burst



<P>involuntarily from my lips.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am a fool!' cried Mr. Rochester suddenly. 'I keep telling

her



<P>I am not married, and do not explain to her why. I forget she knows



<P>nothing of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances



<P>attending my infernal union with her. Oh, I am certain Jane will agree



<P>with me in opinion, when she knows all that I know! Just put your hand



<P>in mine, Janet- that I may have the evidence of touch as well as



<P>sight, to prove you are near me- and I will in a few words show you



<P>the real state of the case. Can you listen to me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir; for hours if you will.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I ask only minutes. Jane, did you ever hear or know that

I was not



<P>the eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious,

grasping



<P>man?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have understood something to that effect.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the

property



<P>together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and



<P>leaving me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my



<P>brother, Rowland. Yet as little could he endure that a son of his



<P>should be a poor man. I must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.

He



<P>sought me a partner betimes. Mr. Mason, a West India planter and



<P>merchant, was his old acquaintance. He was certain his possessions



<P>were real and vast: he made inquiries. Mr. Mason, he found, had a



<P>son and daughter; and he learned from him that he could and would give



<P>the latter a fortune of thirty thousand pounds: that sufficed. When



<P>I left college, I was sent out to Jamaica, to espouse a bride



<P>already courted for me. My father said nothing about her money; but

he



<P>told me Miss Mason was the boast of Spanish Town for her beauty: and



<P>this was no lie. I found her a fine woman, in the style of Blanche



<P>Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic. Her family wished to secure me



<P>because I was of a good race; and so did she. They showed her to me

in



<P>parties, splendidly dressed. I seldom saw her alone, and had very



<P>little private conversation with her. She flattered me, and lavishly



<P>displayed for my pleasure her charms and accomplishments. All the



<P>men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy me. I was dazzled,



<P>stimulated: my senses were excited; and being ignorant, raw, and



<P>inexperienced, I thought I loved her. There is no folly so besotted



<P>that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience, the rashness,



<P>the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its commission. Her



<P>relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she allured me: a



<P>marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was. Oh, I have



<P>no respect for myself when I think of that act!- an agony of inward



<P>contempt masters me. I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not even



<P>know her. I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her nature:



<P>I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor



<P>refinement in her mind or manners- and, I married her:- gross,



<P>grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was! With less sin I might



<P>have- But let me remember to whom I am speaking.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was

dead. The



<P>honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up

in



<P>a lunatic asylum. There was a younger brother, too- a complete dumb



<P>idiot. The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate,



<P>whilst I abhor all his kindred, because he has some grains of



<P>affection in his feeble mind, shown in the continued interest he takes



<P>in his wretched sister, and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore



<P>me), will probably be in the same state one day. My father and my



<P>brother Rowland knew all this; but they thought only of the thirty



<P>thousand pounds, and joined in the plot against me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery

of



<P>concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my



<P>wife, even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes



<P>obnoxious to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and



<P>singularly incapable of being led to anything higher, expanded to



<P>anything larger- when I found that I could not pass a single



<P>evening, nor even a single hour of the day with her in comfort; that



<P>kindly conversation could not be sustained between us, because



<P>whatever topic I started, immediately received from her a turn at once



<P>coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile- when I perceived that I



<P>should never have a quiet or settled household, because no servant



<P>would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and unreasonable



<P>temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory, exacting



<P>orders- even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I



<P>curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust

in



<P>secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details:

some



<P>strong words shall express what I have to say. I lived with that woman



<P>upstairs four years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her



<P>character ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices



<P>sprang up fast and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check



<P>them, and I would not use cruelty. What a pigmy intellect she had, and



<P>what giant propensities! How fearful were the curses those



<P>propensities entailed on me! Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an



<P>infamous mother, dragged me through all the hideous and degrading



<P>agonies which must attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate



<P>and unchaste.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of

the four



<P>years my father died too. I was rich enough now- yet poor to hideous



<P>indigence: a nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was



<P>associated with mine, and called by the law and by society a part of



<P>me. And I could not rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the



<P>doctors now discovered that my wife was mad- her excesses had



<P>prematurely developed the germs of insanity. Jane, you don't like my



<P>narrative; you look almost sick- shall I defer the rest to another



<P>day?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir, finish it now; I pity you- I do earnestly pity

you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting

sort of



<P>tribute, which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of



<P>those who offer it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous,



<P>selfish hearts; it is a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes,



<P>crossed with ignorant contempt for those who have endured them. But



<P>that is not your pity, Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole



<P>face is full at this moment- with which your eyes are now almost



<P>overflowing- with which your heart is heaving- with which your hand

is



<P>trembling in mine. Your pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of



<P>love: its anguish is the very natal pang of the divine passion. I



<P>accept it, Jane; let the daughter have free advent- my arms wait to



<P>receive her.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she

was mad?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of

self-respect



<P>was all that intervened between me and the gulf. In the eyes of the



<P>world, I was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved

to



<P>be clean in my own sight- and to the last I repudiated the



<P>contamination of her crimes, and wrenched myself from connection



<P>with her mental defects. Still, society associated my name and



<P>person with hers; I yet saw her and heard her daily: something of



<P>her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I breathed; and besides, I



<P>remembered I had once been her husband- that recollection was then,



<P>and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover, I knew that while



<P>she lived I could never be the husband of another and better wife;



<P>and, though five years my senior (her family and her father had lied



<P>to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live as



<P>long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind. Thus,



<P>at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'One night I had been awakened by her yells- (since the

medical men



<P>had pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)- it was a



<P>fiery West Indian night; one of the description that frequently



<P>precede the hurricanes of those climates. Being unable to sleep in



<P>bed, I got up and opened the window. The air was like



<P>sulphur-steams- I could find no refreshment anywhere. Mosquitoes



<P>came buzzing in and hummed sullenly round the room; the sea, which I



<P>could hear from thence, rumbled dull like an earthquake- black



<P>clouds were casting up over it; the moon was setting in the waves,



<P>broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball- she threw her last bloody



<P>glance over a world quivering with the ferment of tempest. I was



<P>physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my ears were



<P>filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein she



<P>momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with



<P>such language!- no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary



<P>than she: though two rooms off, I heard every word- the thin



<P>partitions of the West India house opposing but slight obstruction



<P>to her wolfish cries.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"This life," said I at last, "is hell: this is the air-

those



<P>are the sounds of the bottomless pit! I have a right to deliver myself



<P>from it if I can. The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me



<P>with the heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul. Of the fanatic's



<P>burning eternity I have no fear: there is not a future state worse



<P>than this present one- let me break away, and go home to God!"



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk

which



<P>contained a brace of loaded pistols: I meant to shoot myself. I only



<P>entertained the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the



<P>crisis of exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the



<P>wish and design of self-destruction, was past in a second.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed

through



<P>the open casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and



<P>the air grew pure. I then framed and fixed a resolution. While I



<P>walked under the dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst



<P>its drenched pomegranates and pineapples, and while the refulgent dawn



<P>of the tropics kindled round me- I reasoned thus, Jane- and now



<P>listen; for it was true Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and



<P>showed me the right path to follow.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the

refreshed



<P>leaves, and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart,



<P>dried up and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled



<P>with living blood- my being longed for renewal- my soul thirsted for

a



<P>pure draught. I saw hope revive- and felt regeneration possible.



<P>From a flowery arch at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea-



<P>bluer than the sky: the old world was beyond; clear prospects opened



<P>thus:-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"Go," said Hope, "and live again in Europe: there it is

not



<P>known what a sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is



<P>bound to you. You may take the maniac with you to England; confine her



<P>with due attendance and precautions at Thornfield: then travel



<P>yourself to what clime you will, and form what new tie you like.



<P>That woman, who has so abused your long-suffering, so sullied your



<P>name, so outraged your honour, so blighted your youth, is not your



<P>wife, nor are you her husband. See that she is cared for as her



<P>condition demands, and you have done all that God and humanity require



<P>of you. Let her identity, her connection with yourself, be buried in



<P>oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being. Place her



<P>in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation with secrecy, and leave



<P>her."



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I acted precisely on this suggestion. My father and brother

had



<P>not made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very



<P>first letter I wrote to apprise them of the union- having already



<P>begun to experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the



<P>family character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening



<P>to me- I added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the



<P>infamous conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such

as



<P>to make him blush to own her as his daughter-in-law. Far from desiring



<P>to publish the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as



<P>myself.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had

with such



<P>a monster in the vessel. Glad was I when I at last got her to



<P>Thornfield, and saw her safely lodged in that third storey room, of



<P>whose secret inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild



<P>beast's den- a goblin's cell. I had some trouble in finding an



<P>attendant for her, as it was necessary to select one on whose fidelity



<P>dependence could be placed; for her ravings would inevitably betray

my



<P>secret: besides, she had lucid intervals of days- sometimes weeks-



<P>which she filled up with abuse of me. At last I hired Grace Poole from



<P>the Grimsby Retreat. She and the surgeon, Carter (who dressed



<P>Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and worried), are the only



<P>two I have ever admitted to my confidence. Mrs. Fairfax may indeed



<P>have suspected something, but she could have gained no precise



<P>knowledge as to facts. Grace has, on the whole, proved a good



<P>keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it



<P>appears nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing



<P>profession, her vigilance has been more than once lulled and



<P>baffled. The lunatic is both cunning and malignant; she has never



<P>failed to take advantage of her guardian's temporary lapses; once to



<P>secrete the knife with which she stabbed her brother, and twice to



<P>possess herself of the key of her cell, and issue therefrom in the



<P>night-time. On the first of these occasions, she perpetrated the



<P>attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid that ghastly



<P>visit to you. I thank Providence, who watched over you, that she



<P>then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps brought



<P>back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what might



<P>have happened, I cannot endure to reflect. When I think of the thing



<P>which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet



<P>visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what, sir,' I asked, while he paused, 'did you do

when you had



<P>settled her here? Where did you go?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What did I do, Jane? I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.



<P>Where did I go? I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the



<P>March-spirit. I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its



<P>lands. My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent



<P>woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at



<P>Thornfield-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you could not marry, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.

It



<P>was not my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you. I



<P>meant to tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it



<P>appeared to me so absolutely rational that I should be considered free



<P>to love and be loved, I never doubted some woman might be found



<P>willing and able to understand my case and accept me, in spite of



<P>the curse with which I was burdened.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.

You open



<P>your eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless



<P>movement, as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you,



<P>and you wanted to read the tablet of one's heart. But before I go



<P>on, tell me what you mean by your "Well, sir?" It is a small phrase



<P>very frequent with you; and which many a time has drawn me on and on



<P>through interminable talk: I don't very well know why.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I mean,- What next? How did you proceed? What came of

such an



<P>event?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked

her to



<P>marry you; and what she said.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether

I



<P>asked her to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in



<P>the book of Fate. For ten long years I roved about, living first in



<P>one capital, then another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in



<P>Paris; occasionally in Rome, Naples, and Florence. Provided with



<P>plenty of money and the passport of an old name, I could choose my own



<P>society: no circles were closed against me. I sought my ideal of a



<P>woman amongst English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras, and



<P>German grafinnen. I could not find her. Sometimes, for a fleeting



<P>moment, I thought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form,



<P>which announced the realisation of my dream: but I was presently



<P>undeceived. You are not to suppose that I desired perfection, either



<P>of mind or person. I longed only for what suited me- for the antipodes



<P>of the Creole: and I longed vainly. Amongst them all I found not one



<P>whom, had I been ever so free, I- warned as I was of the risks, the



<P>horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions- would have asked to



<P>marry me. Disappointment made me reckless. I tried dissipation-



<P>never debauchery: that I hated, and hate. That was my Indian



<P>Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me



<P>much, even in pleasure. Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed



<P>to approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship

of



<P>mistresses. The first I chose was Celine Varens- another of those



<P>steps which make a man spurn himself when he recalls them. You already



<P>know what she was, and how my liaison with her terminated. She had two



<P>successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered



<P>singularly handsome. What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?



<P>Giacinta was unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.



<P>Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible:



<P>not one whit to my taste. I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to



<P>set her up in a good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.



<P>But, Jane, I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable



<P>opinion of me just now. You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled



<P>rake: don't you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed,

sir.



<P>Did it not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first



<P>with one mistress and then another? You talk of it as a mere matter

of



<P>course.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was with me; and I did not like it. It was a grovelling

fashion



<P>of existence: I should never like to return to it. Hiring a mistress



<P>is the next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature,



<P>and always by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with



<P>inferiors is degrading. I now hate the recollection of the time I



<P>passed with Celine, Giacinta, and Clara.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the

certain



<P>inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching



<P>that had ever been instilled into me, as- under any pretext- with



<P>any justification- through any temptation- to become the successor



<P>of these poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same



<P>feeling which now in his mind desecrated their memory. I did not



<P>give utterance to this conviction: it was enough to feel it. I



<P>impressed it on my heart, that it might remain there to serve me as



<P>aid in the time of trial.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, Jane, why don't you say "Well, sir?" I have not done.

You are



<P>looking grave. You disapprove of me still, I see. But let me come to



<P>the point. Last January, rid of all mistresses- in a harsh, bitter



<P>frame of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life-



<P>corroded with disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and



<P>especially against all womankind (for I began to regard the notion



<P>of an intellectual, faithful, loving woman as a mere dream),



<P>recalled by business, I came back to England.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield



<P>Hall. Abhorred spot! I expected no peace- no pleasure there. On a



<P>stile in Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself. I



<P>passed it as negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it:

I



<P>had no presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning



<P>that the arbitress of my life- my genius for good or evil- waited



<P>there in humble guise. I did not know it, even when, on the occasion



<P>of Mesrour's accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.



<P>Childish and slender creature! It seemed as if a linnet had hopped



<P>to my foot and proposed to bear me on its tiny wing. I was surly;



<P>but the thing would not go: it stood by me with strange



<P>perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort of authority. I must

be



<P>aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something

new- a fresh



<P>sap and sense- stole into my frame. It was well I had learnt that this



<P>elf must return to me- that it belonged to my house down below- or I



<P>could not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it



<P>vanish behind the dim hedge, without singular regret. I heard you come



<P>home that night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I



<P>thought of you or watched for you. The next day I observed you- myself



<P>unseen- for half an hour, while you played with Adele in the



<P>gallery. It was a snowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out



<P>of doors. I was in my room; the door was ajar: I could both listen and



<P>watch. Adele claimed your outward attention for a while; yet I fancied



<P>your thoughts were elsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my



<P>little Jane; you talked to her and amused her a long time. When at



<P>last she left you, you lapsed at once into deep reverie: you betook



<P>yourself slowly to pace the gallery. Now and then, in passing a



<P>casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling snow; you listened to



<P>the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and dreamed. I think



<P>those day visions were not dark: there was a pleasurable



<P>illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in your



<P>aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding: your



<P>look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit



<P>follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal



<P>heaven. The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the



<P>hall, wakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself,



<P>Janet! There was much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and



<P>seemed to make light of your own abstraction. It seemed to say- "My



<P>fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they are



<P>absolutely unreal. I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my



<P>brain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough



<P>tract to travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter."



<P>You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the



<P>weekly house accounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think



<P>it was. I was vexed with you for getting out of my sight.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon

you to my



<P>presence. An unusual- to me- a perfectly new character I suspected was



<P>yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better. You entered



<P>the room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were



<P>quaintly dressed- much as you are now. I made you talk: ere long I



<P>found you full of strange contrasts. Your garb and manner were



<P>restricted by rule; your air was often diffident, and altogether



<P>that of one refined by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and

a



<P>good deal afraid of making herself disadvantageously conspicuous by



<P>some solecism or blunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a



<P>daring, and a glowing eye to your interlocutor's face: there was



<P>penetration and power in each glance you gave; when plied by close



<P>questions, you found ready and round answers. Very soon you seemed



<P>to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence of sympathy



<P>between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was



<P>astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised



<P>your manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear,



<P>annoyance, or displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now



<P>and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot



<P>describe. I was at once content and stimulated with what I saw: I



<P>liked what I had seen, and wished to see more. Yet, for a long time,

I



<P>treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely. I was an



<P>intellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of



<P>making this novel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while



<P>troubled with a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely



<P>its bloom would fade- the sweet charm of freshness would leave it. I



<P>did not then know that it was no transitory blossom, but rather the



<P>radiant resemblance of one, cut in an indestructible gem. Moreover,



<P>I wished to see whether you would seek me if I shunned you- but you



<P>did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as your own desk and



<P>easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as



<P>little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect. Your



<P>habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not



<P>despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had



<P>little hope, and no actual pleasure. I wondered what you thought of



<P>me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I resumed my notice of you. There was something glad in

your



<P>glance, and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had

a



<P>social heart; it was the silent schoolroom- it was the tedium of



<P>your life- that made you mournful. I permitted myself the delight of



<P>being kind to you; kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became



<P>soft in expression, your tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by



<P>your lips in a grateful happy accent. I used to enjoy a chance meeting



<P>with you, Jane, at this time: there was a curious hesitation in your



<P>manner: you glanced at me with a slight trouble- a hovering doubt: you



<P>did not know what my caprice might be- whether I was going to play the



<P>master and be stern, or the friend and be benignant. I was now too



<P>fond of you often to simulate the first whim; and, when I stretched

my



<P>hand out cordially, such bloom and light and bliss rose to your young,



<P>wistful features, I had much ado often to avoid straining you then and



<P>there to my heart.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't talk any more of those days, sir,' I interrupted,



<P>furtively dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was



<P>torture to me; for I knew what I must do- and do soon- and these



<P>reminiscences, and these revelations of his feelings, only made my



<P>work more difficult.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, Jane,' he returned: 'what necessity is there to dwell

on the



<P>Past, when the Present is so much surer- the Future so much brighter?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You see now how the case stands- do you not?' he continued.

'After



<P>a youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in



<P>dreary solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly



<P>love- I have found you. You are my sympathy- my better self- my good



<P>angel. I am bound to you with a strong attachment. I think you good,



<P>gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my



<P>heart; it leans to you, draws you to my centre and spring of life,



<P>wraps my existence about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame,



<P>fuses you and me in one.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to

marry you.



<P>To tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now



<P>that I had but a hideous demon. I was wrong to attempt to deceive you;



<P>but I feared a stubbornness that exists in your character. I feared



<P>early instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before



<P>hazarding confidences. This was cowardly: I should have appealed to



<P>your nobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do now- opened to you



<P>plainly my life of agony- described to you my hunger and thirst



<P>after a higher and worthier existence- shown to you, not my resolution



<P>(that word is weak), but my resistless bent to love faithfully and



<P>well, where I am faithfully and well loved in return. Then I should



<P>have asked you to accept my pledge of fidelity and to give me yours.



<P>Jane- give it me now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A pause.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why are you silent, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped

my



<P>vitals. Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning! Not a



<P>human being that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was



<P>loved; and him who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must



<P>renounce love and idol. One drear word comprised my intolerable



<P>duty- 'Depart!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, you understand what I want of you? Just this promise-

"I



<P>will be yours, Mr. Rochester."'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, I will not be yours.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another long silence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane!' recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me

down with



<P>grief, and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror- for this still



<P>voice was the pant of a lion rising- 'Jane, do you mean to go one



<P>way in the world, and to let me go another?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane' (bending towards and embracing me), 'do you mean

it now?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And now?' softly kissing my forehead and cheek.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do,' extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, Jane, this is bitter! This- this is wicked. It would

not be



<P>wicked to love me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It would to obey you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A wild look raised his brows- crossed his features: he

rose; but he



<P>forbore yet. I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I



<P>shook, I feared- but I resolved.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'One instant, Jane. Give one glance to my horrible life

when you



<P>are gone. All happiness will be torn away with you. What then is left?



<P>For a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer



<P>me to some corpse in yonder churchyard. What shall I do, Jane? Where



<P>turn for a companion and for some hope?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do as I do: trust in God and yourself. Believe in heaven.

Hope



<P>to meet again there.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you will not yield?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?'

His



<P>voice rose.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you snatch love and innocence from me? You fling

me back on



<P>lust for a passion- vice for an occupation?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than

I grasp at



<P>it for myself. We were born to strive and endure- you as well as I:

do



<P>so. You will forget me before I forget you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.

I



<P>declared I could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change



<P>soon. And what a distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in



<P>your ideas, is proved by your conduct! Is it better to drive a



<P>fellow-creature to despair than to transgress a mere human law, no man



<P>being injured by the breach? for you have neither relatives nor



<P>acquaintances whom you need fear to offend by living with me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and

reason



<P>turned traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting



<P>him. They spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured



<P>wildly. 'Oh, comply!' it said. 'Think of his misery; think of his



<P>danger- look at his state when left alone; remember his headlong



<P>nature; consider the recklessness following on despair- soothe him;



<P>save him; love him; tell him you love him and will be his. Who in



<P>the world cares for you? or who will be injured by what you do?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Still indomitable was the reply- 'I care for myself. The

more



<P>solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I



<P>will respect myself. I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by



<P>man. I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and



<P>not mad- as I am now. Laws and principles are not for the times when



<P>there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body



<P>and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they;



<P>inviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I might break



<P>them, what would be their worth? They have a worth- so I have always



<P>believed; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane-



<P>quite insane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating



<P>faster than I can count its throbs. Preconceived opinions, foregone



<P>determinations, are all I have at this hour to stand by: there I plant



<P>my foot.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did. Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had

done so.



<P>His fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,



<P>whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and



<P>grasped my waist. He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance:



<P>physically, I felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the



<P>draught and glow of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul,



<P>and with it the certainty of ultimate safety. The soul, fortunately,



<P>has an interpreter- often an unconscious, but still a truthful



<P>interpreter- in the eye. My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his



<P>fierce face I gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and



<P>my overtaxed strength almost exhausted.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never,' said he, as he ground his teeth, 'never was anything

at



<P>once so frail and so indomitable. A mere reed she feels in my hand!'



<P>(And he shook me with the force of his hold.) 'I could bend her with



<P>my finger and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore,



<P>if I crushed her? Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free



<P>thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage- with a



<P>stern triumph. Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it- the



<P>savage, beautiful creature! If I tear, if I rend the slight prison,

my



<P>outrage will only let the captive loose. Conqueror I might be of the



<P>house; but the inmate would escape to heaven before I could call



<P>myself possessor of its clay dwelling-place. And it is you, spirit-



<P>with will and energy, and virtue and purity- that I want: not alone



<P>your brittle frame. Of yourself you could come with soft flight and



<P>nestle against my heart, if you would: seized against your will, you



<P>will elude the grasp like an essence- you will vanish ere I inhale



<P>your fragrance. Oh! come, Jane, come!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only

looked at



<P>me. The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only



<P>an idiot, however, would have succumbed now. I had dared and baffled



<P>his fury; I must elude his sorrow: retired to the door.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are going, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am going, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are leaving me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?

My



<P>deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What unutterable pathos was in his voice! How hard it was

to



<P>reiterate firmly, 'I am going.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Withdraw, then,- I consent; but remember, you leave me

here in



<P>anguish. Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and,



<P>Jane, cast a glance on my sufferings- think of me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.

'Oh,



<P>Jane! my hope- my love- my life!' broke in anguish from his lips. Then



<P>came a deep, strong sob.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back-

walked



<P>back as determinedly as I had retreated. I knelt down by him; I turned



<P>his face from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his



<P>hair with my hand.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'God bless you, my dear master!' I said. 'God keep you

from harm



<P>and wrong- direct you, solace you- reward you well for your past



<P>kindness to me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Little Jane's love would have been my best reward,' he

answered;



<P>'without it, my heart is broken. But Jane will give me her love:



<P>yes- nobly, generously.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire

from his



<P>eyes; erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace,



<P>and at once quitted the room.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Farewell!' was the cry of my heart as I left him. Despair

added,



<P>'Farewell for ever!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell

on me as



<P>soon as I lay down in bed. I was transported in thought to the



<P>scenes of childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that



<P>the night was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears. The



<P>light that long ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this



<P>vision, seemed glidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause



<P>in the centre of the obscured ceiling. I lifted up my head to look:



<P>the roof resolved to clouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the



<P>moon imparts to vapours she is about to sever. I watched her come-



<P>watched with the strangest anticipation; as though some word of doom



<P>were to be written on her disk. She broke forth as never moon yet



<P>burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the sable folds and waved



<P>them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form shone in the



<P>azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward. It gazed and gazed on



<P>me. It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone, yet so



<P>near, it whispered in my heart-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My daughter, flee temptation.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mother, I will.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I answered after I had waked from the trancelike dream.

It was



<P>yet night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.



<P>'It cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil,'



<P>thought I. I rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my



<P>shoes. I knew where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a



<P>ring. In seeking these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl



<P>necklace Mr. Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago. I



<P>left that; it was not mine: it was the visionary bride's who had



<P>melted in air. The other articles I made up in a parcel; my purse,



<P>containing twenty shillings (it was all I had), I put in my pocket:



<P>I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl, took the parcel and my



<P>slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole from my room.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!' I whispered, as I glided

past her



<P>door. 'Farewell, my darling Adele! I said, as I glanced towards the



<P>nursery. No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her. I



<P>had to deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a

pause;



<P>but my heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my



<P>foot was forced to stop also. No sleep was there: the inmate was



<P>walking restlessly from wall to wall; and again and again he sighed



<P>while I listened. There was a heaven- a temporary heaven- in this room



<P>for me, if I chose: I had but to go in and to say-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through

life till



<P>death,' and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips. I thought of



<P>this.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting

with



<P>impatience for day. He would send for me in the morning; I should be



<P>gone. He would have me sought for: vainly. He would feel himself



<P>forsaken; his love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow



<P>desperate. I thought of this too. My hand moved towards the lock: I



<P>caught it back, and glided on.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to

do, and



<P>I did it mechanically. I sought the key of the side-door in the



<P>kitchen; I sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the



<P>key and the lock. I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I



<P>should have to walk far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late,



<P>must not break down. All this I did without one sound. I opened the



<P>door, passed out, shut it softly. Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.



<P>The great gates were closed and locked; but a wicket in one of them



<P>was only latched. Through that I departed: it, too, I shut; and now



<P>I was out of Thornfield.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched

in the



<P>contrary direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but



<P>often noticed, and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.



<P>No reflection was to be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast



<P>back; not even one forward. Not one thought was to be given either



<P>to the past or to the future. The first was a page so heavenly



<P>sweet- so deadly sad- that to read one line of it would dissolve my



<P>courage and break down my energy. The last was an awful blank:



<P>something like the world when the deluge was gone by.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.

I



<P>believe it was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had



<P>put on when I left the house, were soon wet with dew. But I looked



<P>neither to rising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature. He who

is



<P>taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not



<P>of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and



<P>axe-edge; of the disseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping

at



<P>the end: and I thought of drear flight and homeless wandering- and oh!



<P>with agony I thought of what I left. I could not help it. I thought

of



<P>him now- in his room- watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon



<P>come to say I would stay with him and be his. I longed to be his; I



<P>panted to return: it was not too late; I could yet spare him the



<P>bitter pang of bereavement. As yet my flight, I was sure, was



<P>undiscovered. I could go back and be his comforter- his pride; his



<P>redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin. Oh, that fear of his



<P>self-abandonment- far worse than my abandonment- how it goaded me!



<P>It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to



<P>extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.



<P>Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their



<P>mates; birds were emblems of love. What was I? In the midst of my pain



<P>of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself. I had



<P>no solace from self-approbation: none even from self-respect. I had



<P>injured- wounded- left my master. I was hateful in my own eyes.



<P>Still I could not turn, nor retrace one step. God must have led me on.



<P>As to my own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one



<P>and stifled the other. I was weeping wildly as I walked along my



<P>solitary way: fast, fast I went like one delirious. A weakness,



<P>beginning inwardly, extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I



<P>lay on the ground some minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf. I



<P>had some fear- or hope- that here I should die: but I was soon up;



<P>crawling forwards on my hands and knees, and then again raised to my



<P>feet- as eager and as determined as ever to reach the road.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under

the hedge;



<P>and while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on. I stood up



<P>and lifted my hand; it stopped. I asked where it was going: the driver



<P>named a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had



<P>no connections. I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said



<P>thirty shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to



<P>make it do. He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the



<P>vehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May

your eyes



<P>never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from



<P>mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so



<P>agonised as in that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me,



<P>dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEN Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling



<P>storm continued all night. The next day a keen wind brought fresh



<P>and blinding falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost



<P>impassable. I had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent



<P>the snow from blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after



<P>sitting nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury



<P>of the tempest, I lit a candle, took down Marmion, and beginning-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

'Day set on Norham's castled steep,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And Cheviot's mountains lone;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The massive towers, the donjon keep,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The flanking walls that round them sweep,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In yellow lustre shone'-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I soon forgot storm in music.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door. No;

it was



<P>St. John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen



<P>hurricane- the howling darkness- and stood before me: the cloak that



<P>covered his tall figure all white as a glacier. I was almost in



<P>consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the



<P>blocked-up vale that night.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Any ill news?' I demanded. 'Has anything happened?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No. How very easily alarmed you are!' he answered, removing

his



<P>cloak and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again



<P>coolly pushed the mat which his entrance had deranged. He stamped



<P>the snow from his boots.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I shall sully the purity of your floor,' said he, 'but

you must



<P>excuse me for once.' Then he approached the fire. 'I have had hard



<P>work to get here, I assure you,' he observed, as he warmed his hands



<P>over the flame. 'One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow



<P>is quite soft yet.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But why are you come?' I could not forbear saying.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but

since you



<P>ask it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired

of



<P>my mute books and empty rooms. Besides, since yesterday I have



<P>experienced the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been



<P>half-told, and who is impatient to hear the sequel.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He sat down. I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday,

and



<P>really I began to fear his wits were touched. If he were insane,



<P>however, his was a very cool and collected insanity: I had never



<P>seen that handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled



<P>marble than it did just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from



<P>his forehead and let the firelight shine free on his pale brow and



<P>cheek as pale, where it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of



<P>care or sorrow now so plainly graved. I waited, expecting he would say



<P>something I could at least comprehend; but his hand was now at his



<P>chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking. It struck me that his



<P>hand looked wasted like his face. A perhaps uncalled-for gush of



<P>pity came over my heart: I was moved to say-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it

is too bad



<P>that you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your



<P>own health.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all,' said he: 'I care for myself when necessary.

I am well



<P>now. What do you see amiss in me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference,

which



<P>showed that my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly



<P>superfluous. I was silenced.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and

still



<P>his eye dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say



<P>something, I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from



<P>the door, which was behind him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, no!' he responded shortly and somewhat testily.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well,' I reflected, 'if you won't talk, you may be still;

I'll let



<P>you alone now, and return to my book.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of Marmion.

He soon



<P>stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out



<P>a morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in



<P>silence, folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation. It was vain



<P>to try to read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could



<P>I, in my impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he



<P>liked, but talk I would.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not since the letter I showed you a week ago.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?



<P>You will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall

me.' Baffled



<P>so far, I changed my ground. I bethought myself to talk about the



<P>school and my scholars.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to

the



<P>school this morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from



<P>the Foundry Close- they would have come to-day but for the snow.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Oliver pays for two.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Does he?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I know.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Was it your suggestion?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whose, then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'His daughter's, I think.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is like her: she is so good-natured.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight

strokes. It



<P>aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the

fire,' he



<P>said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Half an hour ago,' he pursued, 'I spoke of my impatience

to hear



<P>the sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be



<P>better managed by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting



<P>you into a listener. Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you



<P>that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale



<P>details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass through



<P>new lips. For the rest, whether trite or novel, it is short.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Twenty years ago, a poor curate- never mind his name at

this



<P>moment- fell in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with



<P>him, and married him, against the advice of all her friends, who



<P>consequently disowned her immediately after the wedding. Before two



<P>years passed, the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by



<P>side under one slab. (I have seen their grave; it formed part of the



<P>pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old



<P>daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in her lap-



<P>cold as that of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night.



<P>Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal



<P>relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-law, called (I come to names



<P>now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead. You start- did you hear a noise? I



<P>daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining



<P>schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it repaired and altered, and



<P>barns are generally haunted by rats.- To proceed. Mrs. Reed kept the



<P>orphan ten years: whether it was happy or not with her, I cannot



<P>say, never having been told; but at the end of that time she



<P>transferred it to a place you know- being no other than Lowood School,



<P>where you so long resided yourself. It seems her career there was very



<P>honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like yourself-



<P>really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history and



<P>yours- she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were



<P>analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.



<P>Rochester.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rivers!' I interrupted.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I can guess your feelings,' he said, 'but restrain them

for a



<P>while: I have nearly finished; hear me to the end. Of Mr.



<P>Rochester's character I know nothing, but the one fact that he



<P>professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl, and that

at



<P>the very altar she discovered he had a wife yet alive, though a



<P>lunatic. What his subsequent conduct and proposals were is a matter

of



<P>pure conjecture; but when an event transpired which rendered inquiry



<P>after the governess necessary, it was discovered she was gone- no



<P>one could tell when, where, or how. She had left Thornfield Hall in



<P>the night; every research after her course had been vain: the



<P>country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of information could



<P>be gathered respecting her. Yet that she should be found is become a



<P>matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put in all the



<P>papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a



<P>solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted. Is it not



<P>an odd tale?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just tell me this,' said I, 'and since you know so much,

you



<P>surely can tell it me- what of Mr. Rochester? How and where is he?



<P>What is he doing? Is he well?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter

never



<P>mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I



<P>have adverted to. You should rather ask the name of the governess- the



<P>nature of the event which requires her appearance.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then? Did no one see

Mr.



<P>Rochester?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I suppose not.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But they wrote to him?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what did he say? Who has his letters?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application

was not



<P>from Mr. Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed "Alice Fairfax."'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably

true:



<P>he had in all probability left England and rushed in reckless



<P>desperation to some former haunt on the Continent. And what opiate for



<P>his severe sufferings- what object for his strong passions- had he



<P>sought there? I dared not answer the question. Oh, my poor master-



<P>once almost my husband- whom I had often called 'my dear Edward!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He must have been a bad man,' observed Mr. Rivers.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You don't know him- don't pronounce an opinion upon him,'

I



<P>said, with warmth.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very well,' he answered quietly: 'and indeed my head is



<P>otherwise occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish. Since



<P>you won't ask the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.



<P>Stay! I have it here- it is always more satisfactory to see



<P>important points written down, fairly committed to black and white.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened,

sought



<P>through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of



<P>paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains

of



<P>ultra-marine, and lake, and vermilion, the ravished margin of the



<P>portrait-cover. He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read,



<P>traced in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words 'JANE EYRE'-



<P>the work doubtless of some moment of abstraction.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:' he said, 'the advertisements



<P>demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.- I confess I had my



<P>suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once



<P>resolved into certainty. You own the name and renounce the alias?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes- yes; but where is Mr. Briggs? He perhaps knows more

of Mr.



<P>Rochester than you do.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Briggs is in London. I should doubt his knowing anything

at all



<P>about Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.



<P>Meantime, you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do



<P>not inquire why Mr. Briggs sought after you- what he wanted with you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, what did he want?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira,

is



<P>dead; that he has left you all his property, and that you are now



<P>rich- merely that- nothing more.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I!- rich?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, you, rich- quite an heiress.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence succeeded.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You must prove your identity of course,' resumed St. John



<P>presently: 'a step which will offer no difficulties; you can then



<P>enter on immediate possession. Your fortune is vested in the English



<P>funds; Briggs has the will and the necessary documents.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here was a new card turned up! It is a fine thing, reader,

to be



<P>lifted in a moment from indigence to wealth- a very fine thing; but



<P>not a matter one can comprehend or consequently enjoy, all at once.



<P>And then there are other chances in life far more thrilling and



<P>rapture-giving: this is solid, an affair of the actual world,



<P>nothing ideal about it: all its associations are solid and sober,



<P>and its manifestations are the same. One does not jump, and spring,



<P>and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a fortune; one begins to



<P>consider responsibilities, and to ponder business; on a base of steady



<P>satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain ourselves, and



<P>brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with

the words,



<P>Death, Funeral. My uncle I had heard was dead- my only relative;



<P>ever since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope



<P>of one day seeing him: now, I never should. And then this money came



<P>only to me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.



<P>It was a grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious-



<P>yes, I felt that- that thought swelled my heart.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You unbend your forehead at last,' said Mr. Rivers. 'I

thought



<P>Medusa had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.



<P>Perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How much am I worth?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, a trifle! Nothing of course to speak of- twenty thousand



<P>pounds, I think they say- but what is that?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Twenty thousand pounds?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here was a new stunner- I had been calculating on four

or five



<P>thousand. This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St.



<P>John, whom I had never heard laugh before, laughed now.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well,' said he, 'if you had committed a murder, and I

had told you



<P>your crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a large sum- don't you think there is a mistake?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No mistake at all.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps you have read the figures wrong- it may be two

thousand!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is written in letters, not figures,- twenty thousand.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical



<P>powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions



<P>for a hundred. Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If it were not such a very wild night,' he said, 'I would

send



<P>Hannah down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable

to



<P>be left alone. But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts



<P>so well as I: her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you



<P>to your sorrows. Good-night.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to

me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Stop one minute!' I cried.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about

me; or how



<P>he knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way



<P>place, had the power to aid in my discovery.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! I am a clergyman,' he said; 'and the clergy are often

appealed



<P>to about odd matters.' Again the latch rattled.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; that does not satisfy me!' I exclaimed: and indeed

there was



<P>something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of



<P>allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a very strange piece of business,' I added; 'I must

know



<P>more about it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Another time.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; to-night!- to-night!' and as he turned from the door,

I placed



<P>myself between it and him. He looked rather embarrassed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You certainly shall not go till you have told me all,'

I said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would rather not just now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You shall!- you must!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would rather Diana or Mary informed you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax:



<P>gratified it must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I apprised you that I was a hard man,' said he, 'difficult



<P>to persuade.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And I am a hard woman,- impossible to put off.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And then,' he pursued, 'I am cold: no fervour infects

me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice. The blaze there

has



<P>thawed all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has



<P>streamed on to my floor, and made it like a trampled street. As you



<P>hope ever to be forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and



<P>misdemeanour of spoiling a sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to



<P>know.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, then,' he said, 'I yield; if not to your earnestness,

to



<P>your perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping. Besides,



<P>you must know some day,- as well now as later. Your name is Jane



<P>Eyre?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course: that was all settled before.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?-

that I was



<P>christened St. John Eyre Rivers?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, indeed! I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised

in



<P>your initials written in books you have at different times lent me;



<P>but I never asked for what name it stood. But what then? Surely-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much

less to



<P>express, the thought that rushed upon me- that embodied itself,- that,



<P>in a second, stood out a strong, solid probability. Circumstances knit



<P>themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had



<P>been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out



<P>straight,- every ring was perfect, the connection complete. I knew,

by



<P>instinct, how the matter stood, before St. John had said another word;



<P>but I cannot expect the reader to have the same intuitive



<P>perception, so I must repeat his explanation.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a



<P>clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John



<P>Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira. Mr. Briggs, being



<P>Mr. Eyre's solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our



<P>uncle's death, and to say that he had left his property to his brother



<P>the clergyman's orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a



<P>quarrel, never forgiven, between him and my father. He wrote again a



<P>few weeks since, to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking



<P>if we knew anything of her. A name casually written on a slip of paper



<P>has enabled me to find her out. You know the rest.' Again he was



<P>going, but I set my back against the door.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do let me speak,' I said; 'let me have one moment to draw

breath



<P>and reflect.' I paused- he stood before me, hat in hand, looking



<P>composed enough. I resumed-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your mother was my father's sister?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My aunt, consequently?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He bowed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My uncle John was your uncle John? You, Diana, and Mary

are his



<P>sister's children, as I am his brother's child?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Undeniably.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each

side flows



<P>from the same source?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We are cousins; yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I surveyed him. It seemed I had found a brother: one I

could be



<P>proud of,- one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were



<P>such, that, when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had



<P>inspired me with genuine affection and admiration. The two girls, on



<P>whom, kneeling down on the wet ground, and looking through the low,



<P>latticed window of Moor House kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a



<P>mixture of interest and despair, were my near kinswomen; and the young



<P>and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at his threshold



<P>was my blood relation. Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch! This was



<P>wealth indeed!- wealth to the heart!- a mine of pure, genial



<P>affections. This was a blessing, bright, vivid, and exhilarating;- not



<P>like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and welcome enough in its way,



<P>but sobering from its weight. I now clapped my hands in sudden joy-

my



<P>pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, I am glad!- I am glad!' I exclaimed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. John smiled. 'Did I not say you neglected essential

points to



<P>pursue trifles?' he asked. 'You were serious when I told you you had



<P>got a fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What can you mean? It may be of no moment to you; you

have sisters



<P>and don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three



<P>relations,- or two, if you don't choose to be counted,- are born



<P>into my world full-grown. I say again, I am glad!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated

with the



<P>thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle



<P>them:- thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that



<P>ere long. I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with



<P>ascending stars,- every one lit me to a purpose or delight. Those



<P>who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I



<P>could now benefit. They were under a yoke,- I could free them: they



<P>were scattered,- I could reunite them: the independence, the affluence



<P>which was mine, might be theirs too. Were we not four? Twenty thousand



<P>pounds shared equally, would be five thousand each,- enough and to



<P>spare: justice would be done,- mutual happiness secured. Now the



<P>wealth did not weigh on me: now it was not a mere bequest of coin,-

it



<P>was a legacy of life, hope, enjoyment.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by

storm, I



<P>cannot tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair



<P>behind me, and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it. He



<P>also advised me to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of



<P>helplessness and distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk



<P>about again.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow,' I said, 'and tell

them to come



<P>home directly. Diana said they would both consider themselves rich



<P>with a thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell me where I can get you a glass of water,' said St.

John; 'you



<P>must really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest

have on you?



<P>Will it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and



<P>settle down like an ordinary mortal?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You wander: your head becomes confused. I have been too

abrupt



<P>in communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational



<P>enough; it is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to



<P>misunderstand.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully,

I should



<P>comprehend better.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Explain! What is there to explain? You cannot fail to

see that



<P>twenty thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between



<P>the nephew and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to



<P>each? What I want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell



<P>them of the fortune that has accrued to them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To you, you mean.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of

taking any



<P>other. I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly



<P>ungrateful. Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.



<P>I like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and



<P>Mary, and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary. It would



<P>please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment



<P>and oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never



<P>be mine in justice, though it might in law. I abandon to you, then,



<P>what is absolutely superfluous to me. Let there be no opposition,



<P>and no discussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and



<P>decide the point at once.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to

consider



<P>such a matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see

the



<P>justice of the case?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all

custom.



<P>Besides, the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his



<P>own efforts; he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to



<P>you. After all, justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a



<P>clear conscience, consider it absolutely your own.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With me,' said I, 'it is fully as much a matter of feeling

as of



<P>conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an



<P>opportunity of doing so. Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for

a



<P>year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught



<P>a glimpse- that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning



<P>to myself life-long friends.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You think so now,' rejoined St. John, 'because you do

not know



<P>what it is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot



<P>form a notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you;



<P>of the place it would enable you to take in society; of the



<P>prospects it would open to you: you cannot-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you,' I interrupted, 'cannot at all imagine the craving

I have



<P>for fraternal and sisterly love. I never had a home, I never had



<P>brothers or sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not



<P>reluctant to admit me and own me, are you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I will be your brother- my sisters will be your

sisters-



<P>without stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Brother? Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues! Sisters?

Yes;



<P>slaving amongst strangers! I, wealthy- gorged with gold I never earned



<P>and do not merit! You, penniless! Famous equality and



<P>fraternisation! Close union! Intimate attachment!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic



<P>happiness may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate:



<P>you may marry.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nonsense, again! Marry! I don't want to marry, and never

shall



<P>marry.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are

a proof



<P>of the excitement under which you labour.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how

averse



<P>are my inclinations to the bare thought of marriage. No one would take



<P>me for love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money



<P>speculation. And I do not want a stranger- unsympathising, alien,



<P>different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full



<P>fellow-feeling. Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the



<P>words I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them



<P>sincerely.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think I can. I know I have always loved my own sisters;

and I



<P>know on what my affection for them is grounded,- respect for their



<P>worth and admiration of their talents. You too have principle and



<P>mind: your tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your



<P>presence is always agreeable to me; in your conversation I have



<P>already for some time found a salutary solace. I feel I can easily and



<P>naturally make room in my heart for you, as my third and youngest



<P>sister.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you: that contents me for to-night. Now you had

better go;



<P>for if you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some



<P>mistrustful scruple.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And the school, Miss Eyre? It must now be shut up, I suppose?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No. I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had,

and



<P>arguments I used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I



<P>wished. My task was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely



<P>resolved- as my cousins saw at length that my mind was really and



<P>immutably fixed on making a just division of the property- as they



<P>must in their own hearts have felt the equity of the intention; and



<P>must, besides, have been innately conscious that in my place they



<P>would have done precisely what I wished to do- they yielded at



<P>length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration. The



<P>judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in

my



<P>opinion: I carried my point. The instruments of transfer were drawn



<P>out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a



<P>competency.

CHAPTER XXV</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours

were being



<P>numbered. There was no putting off the day that advanced- the bridal



<P>day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete. I, at



<P>least, had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked,



<P>corded, ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber;



<P>to-morrow, at this time, they would be far on their road to London:



<P>and so should I (D.V.),- or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a



<P>person whom as yet I knew not. The cards of address alone remained



<P>to nail on: they lay, four little squares, in the drawer. Mr.



<P>Rochester had himself written the direction, 'Mrs. Rochester,-



<P>Hotel, London,' on each: I could not persuade myself to affix them,

or



<P>to have them affixed. Mrs. Rochester! She did not exist: she would not



<P>be born till to-morrow, some time after eight o'clock A.M.; and I



<P>would wait to be assured she had come into the world alive before I



<P>assigned to her all that property. It was enough that in yonder



<P>closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be hers had



<P>already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet: for



<P>not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the pearl-coloured



<P>robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped portmanteau. I shut



<P>the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like apparel it contained;



<P>which, at this evening hour- nine o'clock- gave out certainly a most



<P>ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment. 'I will leave



<P>you by yourself, white dream,' I said. 'I am feverish: I hear the wind



<P>blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish;

not



<P>only the anticipation of the great change- the new life which was to



<P>commence to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share,



<P>doubtless, in producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me



<P>forth at this late hour into the darkening grounds: but a third



<P>cause influenced my mind more than they.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had at heart a strange and anxious thought. Something

had



<P>happened which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen



<P>the event but myself: it had taken place the preceding night. Mr.



<P>Rochester that night was absent from home; nor was he yet returned:



<P>business had called him to a small estate of two or three farms he



<P>possessed thirty miles off- business it was requisite he should settle



<P>in person, previous to his meditated departure from England. I



<P>waited now his return; eager to disburthen my mind, and to seek of him



<P>the solution of the enigma that perplexed me. Stay till he comes,



<P>reader: and, when I disclose my secret to him, you shall share the



<P>confidence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind,

which



<P>all day had blown strong and full from the south, without, however,



<P>bringing a speck of rain. Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it



<P>seemed to augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew



<P>steadfastly one way, never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back



<P>their boughs once in an hour; so continuous was the strain bending



<P>their branchy heads northward- the clouds drifted from pole to pole,



<P>fast following, mass on mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been



<P>visible that July day.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before

the wind,



<P>delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent



<P>thundering through space. Descending the laurel walk, I faced the



<P>wreck of the chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk,



<P>split down the centre, gaped ghastly. The cloven halves were not



<P>broken from each other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them



<P>unsundered below; though community of vitality was destroyed- the



<P>sap could flow no more: their great boughs on each side were dead, and



<P>next winter's tempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth:



<P>as yet, however, they might be said to form one tree- a ruin, but an



<P>entire ruin.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You did right to hold fast to each other,' I said: as

if the



<P>monster-splinters were living things, and could hear me. 'I think,



<P>scathed as you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a



<P>little sense of life in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the



<P>faithful, honest roots: you will never have green leaves more- never



<P>more see birds making nests and singing idyls in your boughs; the time



<P>of pleasure and love is over with you: but you are not desolate:



<P>each of you has a comrade to sympathise with him in his decay.' As I



<P>looked up at them, the moon appeared momentarily in that part of the



<P>sky which filled their fissure; her disk was blood-red and half



<P>overcast; she seemed to throw on me one bewildered, dreary glance, and



<P>buried herself again instantly in the deep drift of cloud. The wind



<P>fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far away over wood and



<P>water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to listen to, and



<P>I ran off again.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered

up the



<P>apples with which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn;



<P>then I employed myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried



<P>them into the house and put them away in the storeroom. Then I



<P>repaired to the library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for,



<P>though summer, I knew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would



<P>like to see a cheerful hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had



<P>been kindled some time, and burnt well. I placed his arm-chair by



<P>the chimney-corner: I wheeled the table near it: I let down the



<P>curtain, and had the candles brought in ready for lighting. More



<P>restless than ever, when I had completed these arrangements I could



<P>not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a little timepiece in the



<P>room and the old clock in the hall simultaneously struck ten.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How late it grows!' I said. 'I will run down to the gates:

it is



<P>moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road. He may be



<P>coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered

the



<P>gates; but the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the



<P>left, was all still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds



<P>crossing it at intervals as the moon looked out, it was a long pale



<P>line, unvaried by one moving speck.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked- a tear of



<P>disappointment and impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away. I



<P>lingered; the moon shut herself wholly within her chamber, and drew



<P>close her curtain of dense cloud: the night grew dark; rain came



<P>driving fast on the gale.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wish he would come! I wish he would come!' I exclaimed,

seized



<P>with hypochondriac foreboding. I had expected his arrival before



<P>tea; now it was dark: what could keep him? Had an accident happened?



<P>The event of last night again recurred to me. I interpreted it as a



<P>warning of disaster. I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised;



<P>and I had enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune



<P>had passed its meridian, and must now decline.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I cannot return to the house,' I thought; 'I cannot

sit by



<P>the fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire



<P>my limbs than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured

a quarter



<P>of a mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full



<P>gallop; a dog ran by his side. Away with evil presentiment! It was he:



<P>here he was, mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot. He saw me; for the



<P>moon had opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright:



<P>he took his hat off, and waved it round his head. I now ran to meet



<P>him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There!' he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and

bent from



<P>the saddle: 'you can't do without me, that is evident. Step on my



<P>boot-toe; give me both hands: mount!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him. A

hearty



<P>kissing I got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I



<P>swallowed as well as I could. He checked himself in his exultation



<P>to demand, 'But is there anything the matter, Janet, that you come



<P>to meet me at such an hour? Is there anything wrong?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, but I thought you would never come. I could not bear

to wait



<P>in the house for you, especially with this rain and wind.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Rain and wind, indeed! Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid;



<P>pull my cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your



<P>cheek and hand are burning hot. I ask again, is there anything the



<P>matter?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you have been both?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by and by, sir;

and I



<P>daresay you will only laugh at me for my pains.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till

then I



<P>dare not: my prize is not certain. This is you, who have been as



<P>slippery as an eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose? I



<P>could not lay a finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to



<P>have gathered up a stray lamb in my arms. You wandered out of the fold



<P>to seek your shepherd, did you, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wanted you: but don't boast. Here we are at Thornfield:

now



<P>let me get down.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He landed me on the pavement. As John took his horse, and

he



<P>followed me into the hall, he told me to make haste and put



<P>something dry on, and then return to him in the library; and he



<P>stopped me, as I made for the staircase, to extort a promise that I



<P>would not be long: nor was I long; in five minutes I rejoined him. I



<P>found him at supper.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it

is the



<P>last meal but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it because you have the prospect of a journey before

you, Jane?



<P>Is it the thoughts of going to London that takes away your appetite?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I

hardly know



<P>what thoughts I have in my head. Everything in life seems unreal.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Except me: I am substantial enough- touch me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a

mere dream.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He held out his hand, laughing. 'Is that a dream?' said

he, placing



<P>it close to my eyes. He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand,

as



<P>well as a long, strong arm.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream,' said I, as I put

it down



<P>from before my face. 'Sir, have you finished supper?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I rang the bell and ordered away the tray. When we were

again



<P>alone, I stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's



<P>knee.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is near midnight,' I said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me

the night



<P>before my wedding.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two

at least:



<P>I have no wish to go to bed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are all your arrangements complete?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And on my part likewise,' he returned, 'I have settled

everything;



<P>and we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half an hour after our



<P>return from church.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very well, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word-

"very



<P>well," Jane! What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek!



<P>and how strangely your eyes glitter! Are you well?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe I am.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Believe! What is the matter? Tell me what you feel.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.

I wish this



<P>present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next day



<P>may come charged?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This is hypochondria, Jane. You have been over-excited,

or



<P>over-fatigued.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Calm?- no: but happy- to the heart's core.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face:

it was



<P>ardent and flushed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Give me your confidence, Jane,' he said: 'relieve your

mind of any



<P>weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me. What do you fear?-



<P>that I shall not prove a good husband?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is the idea farthest from my thoughts.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to

enter?- of



<P>the new life into which you are passing?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity



<P>perplex and pain me. I want an explanation.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, sir, listen. You were from home last night?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something



<P>which had happened in my absence:- nothing, probably, of



<P>consequence; but, in short, it has disturbed you. Let me hear it. Mrs.



<P>Fairfax has said something, perhaps? or you have overheard the



<P>servants talk?- your sensitive self-respect has been wounded?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir.' It struck twelve- I waited till the timepiece

had



<P>concluded its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating



<P>stroke, and then I proceeded.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my



<P>ceaseless bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by



<P>any haunting fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a



<P>glorious thing to have the hope of living with you, because I love



<P>you. No, sir, don't caress me now- let me talk undisturbed.



<P>Yesterday I trusted well in Providence, and believed that events



<P>were working together for your good and mine: it was a fine day, if



<P>you recollect- the calmness of the air and sky forbade apprehensions



<P>respecting your safety or comfort on your journey. I walked a little



<P>while on the pavement after tea, thinking of you; and I beheld you



<P>in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your actual presence. I



<P>thought of the life that lay before me- your life, sir- an existence



<P>more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more so as the depths



<P>of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows of its own



<P>strait channel. I wondered why moralists call this world a dreary



<P>wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose. Just at sunset, the air



<P>turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs



<P>to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under

it



<P>in the box I found your present- the veil which, in your princely



<P>extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I



<P>would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.



<P>I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about



<P>your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian



<P>bride in the attributes of a peeress. I thought how I would carry down



<P>to you the square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a



<P>covering for my low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for



<P>a woman who could bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor



<P>connections. I saw plainly how you would look; and heard your



<P>impetuous republican answers, and your haughty disavowal of any



<P>necessity on your part to augment your wealth, or elevate your



<P>standing, by marrying either a purse or a coronet.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How well you read me, you witch!' interposed Mr. Rochester:

'but



<P>what did you find in the veil besides its embroidery? Did you find



<P>poison, or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the

fabric, I



<P>found nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare



<P>me, because I am used to the sight of the demon. But, sir, as it



<P>grew dark, the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows



<P>now- wild and high- but "with a sullen, moaning sound" far more eerie.



<P>I wished you were at home. I came into this room, and the sight of the



<P>empty chair and fireless hearth chilled me. For some time after I went



<P>to bed, I could not sleep- a sense of anxious excitement distressed



<P>me. The gale still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful



<P>under-sound; whether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell,



<P>but it recurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made



<P>out it must be some dog howling at a distance. I was glad when it



<P>ceased. On sleeping, I continued in dreams the idea of a dark and



<P>gusty night. I continued also the wish to be with you, and experienced



<P>a strange, regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us. During



<P>all my first sleep, I was following the windings of an unknown road;



<P>total obscurity environed me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with



<P>the charge of a little child: a very small creature, too young and



<P>feeble to walk, and which shivered in my cold arms, and wailed



<P>piteously in my ear. I thought, sir, that you were on the road a



<P>long way before me; and I strained every nerve to overtake you, and



<P>made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat you to stop-



<P>but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away



<P>inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every



<P>moment.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when

I am



<P>close to you? Little nervous subject! Forget visionary woe, and



<P>think only of real happiness! You say you love me, Janet: yes- I



<P>will not forget that; and you cannot deny it. Those words did not



<P>die inarticulate on your lips. I heard them clear and soft: a



<P>thought too solemn perhaps, but sweet as music- "I think it is a



<P>glorious thing to have the hope of living with you, Edward, because



<P>I love you." Do you love me, Jane?- repeat it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do, sir- I do, with my whole heart.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well,' he said, after some minutes' silence, 'it is strange;

but



<P>that sentence has penetrated my breast painfully. Why? I think because



<P>you said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your



<P>upward gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and



<P>devotion: it is too much as if some spirit were near me. Look



<P>wicked, Jane: as you know well how to look: coin one of your wild,



<P>shy, provoking smiles, tell me you hate me- tease me, vex me; do



<P>anything but move me: I would rather be incensed than saddened.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content,

when I



<P>have finished my tale: but hear me to the end.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I thought, Jane, you had told me all. I thought I had

found the



<P>source of your melancholy in a dream.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head. 'What! is there more? But I will not believe

it to



<P>be anything important. I warn you of incredulity beforehand. Go on.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience

of



<P>his manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was

a dreary



<P>ruin, the retreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the



<P>stately front nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and



<P>very fragile-looking. I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the



<P>grass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth,



<P>and there over a fallen fragment of cornice. Wrapped up in a shawl,



<P>I still carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down



<P>anywhere, however tired were my arms- however much its weight



<P>impeded my progress, I must retain it. I heard the gallop of a horse



<P>at a distance on the road; I was sure it was you; and you were



<P>departing for many years and for a distant country. I climbed the thin



<P>wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you



<P>from the top: the stones rolled from under my feet, the ivy branches

I



<P>grasped gave way, the child clung round my neck in terror, and



<P>almost strangled me; at last I gained the summit. I saw you like a



<P>speck on a white track, lessening every moment. The blast blew so



<P>strong I could not stand. I sat down on the narrow ledge; I hushed the



<P>scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the road: I bent



<P>forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was shaken; the



<P>child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and woke.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, Jane, that is all.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come. On waking,

a



<P>gleam dazzled my eyes; I thought- Oh, it is daylight! But I was



<P>mistaken; it was only candlelight. Sophie, I supposed, had come in.



<P>There was a light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet,



<P>where, before going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil,



<P>stood open; I heard a rustling there. I asked, "Sophie, what are you



<P>doing?" No one answered; but a form emerged from the closet; it took



<P>the light, held it aloft, and surveyed the garments pendent from the



<P>portmanteau. "Sophie! Sophie!" I again cried: and still it was silent.



<P>I had risen up in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then



<P>bewilderment, came over me; and then my blood crept cold through my



<P>veins. Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not



<P>Mrs. Fairfax: it was not- no, I was sure of it, and am still- it was



<P>not even that strange woman, Grace Poole.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It must have been one of them,' interrupted my master.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary. The shape

standing



<P>before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield



<P>Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Describe it, Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and

dark



<P>hair hanging long down her back. I know not what dress she had on:



<P>it was white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I



<P>cannot tell.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you see her face?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at first. But presently she took my veil from its

place; she



<P>held it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head,



<P>and turned to the mirror. At that moment I saw the reflection of the



<P>visage and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And how were they?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fearful and ghastly to me- oh, sir, I never saw a face

like it! It



<P>was a discoloured face- it was a savage face. I wish I could forget



<P>the roll of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the



<P>lineaments!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ghosts are usually pale, Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark;

the brow



<P>furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.



<P>Shall I tell you of what it reminded me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You may.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of the foul German spectre- the Vampyre.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah!- what did it do?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in

two parts,



<P>and flinging both on the floor, trampled on them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Afterwards?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps

it saw



<P>dawn approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.



<P>Just at my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me-



<P>she thrust up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under



<P>my eyes. I was aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost



<P>consciousness: for the second time in my life- only the second time-

I



<P>became insensible from terror.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who was with you when you revived?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No one, sir, but the broad day. I rose, bathed my head

and face in



<P>water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,



<P>and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision. Now



<P>sir, tell me who and what that woman was?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.

I



<P>must be careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made



<P>for rough handling.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing

was



<P>real: the transaction actually took place.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And your previous dreams, were they real too? Is Thornfield

Hall a



<P>ruin? Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles? Am I leaving you



<P>without a tear- without a kiss- without a word?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not yet.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Am I about to do it? Why, the day is already commenced

which is to



<P>bind us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no



<P>recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mental terrors, sir! I wish I could believe them to be

only



<P>such: I wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to



<P>me the mystery of that awful visitant.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning,

and



<P>when I looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the



<P>cheerful aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there- on



<P>the carpet- I saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,- the



<P>veil, torn from top to bottom in two halves!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung

his arms



<P>round me. 'Thank God!' he exclaimed, 'that if anything malignant did



<P>come near you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed. Oh,

to



<P>think what might have happened!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him,

I



<P>could scarcely pant. After some minutes' silence, he continued,



<P>cheerily-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it. It was half

dream,



<P>half reality. A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that



<P>woman was- must have been- Grace Poole. You call her a strange being



<P>yourself: from all you know, you have reason so to call her- what



<P>did she do to me? what to Mason? In a state between sleeping and



<P>waking, you noticed her entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost



<P>delirious as you were, you ascribed to her a goblin appearance



<P>different from her own: the long dishevelled hair, the swelled black



<P>face, the exaggerated stature, were figments of imagination; results



<P>of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of the veil was real: and it is



<P>like her. I see you would ask why I keep such a woman in my house:



<P>when we have been married a year and a day, I will tell you; but not



<P>now. Are you satisfied, Jane? Do you accept my solution of the



<P>mystery?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible



<P>one: satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear



<P>so- relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented



<P>smile. And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?' he asked,

as I



<P>lit my candle.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.

You must



<P>share it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident



<P>you have related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did



<P>not sleep alone: promise me to go to the nursery.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I shall be very glad to do so, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And fasten the door securely on the inside. Wake Sophie

when you



<P>go upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good



<P>time to-morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast



<P>before eight. And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care



<P>away, Janet. Don't you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen?



<P>and there is no more beating of rain against the window-panes: look



<P>here' (he lifted up the curtain)- 'it is a lovely night!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was. Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds,

now



<P>trooping before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing



<P>off eastward in long, silvered columns. The moon shone peacefully.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well,' said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my

eyes, 'how



<P>is my Janet now?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The night is serene, sir; and so am I.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night;

but of



<P>happy love and blissful union.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed

dream of



<P>sorrow, but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.



<P>With little Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood- so



<P>tranquil, so passionless, so innocent- and waited for the coming



<P>day: all my life was awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the



<P>sun rose I rose too. I remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I



<P>remember I kissed her as I loosened her little hands from my neck; and



<P>I cried over her with strange emotion, and quitted her because I



<P>feared my sobs would break her still sound repose. She seemed the



<P>emblem of my past life; and he I was now to array myself to meet,



<P>the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future day.

age can describe; but just as they all



<P>rose, stifling my breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up



<P>and passed me: in passing, she lifted her eyes. What a strange light



<P>inspired them! What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through



<P>me! How the new feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had



<P>passed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I



<P>mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand



<P>on the stool. Helen Burns asked some slight questions about her work



<P>of Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned



<P>to her place, and smiled at me as she again went by. What a smile! I



<P>remember it now, and I know that it was the effluence of fine



<P>intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked lineaments, her



<P>thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from the aspect of



<P>an angel. Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm 'the untidy



<P>badge;' scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by Miss



<P>Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she had



<P>blotted an exercise in copying it out. Such is the imperfect nature

of



<P>man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes



<P>like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind



<P>to the full brightness of the orb.

<P>the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something



<P>more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and



<P>obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to



<P>the spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince



<P>fortitude under the temporary privation. A brief address on those



<P>occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor



<P>would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the



<P>primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the



<P>exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples



<P>to take up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man



<P>shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out



<P>of the mouth of God; to His divine consolations, "If ye suffer



<P>hunger or thirst for My sake, happy are ye." Oh, madam, when you put



<P>bread and cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children's



<P>mouths, you may indeed feed their vile bodies, but you little think



<P>how you starve their immortal souls!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Brocklehurst again paused- perhaps overcome by his

feelings.



<P>Miss Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but



<P>she now gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as



<P>marble, appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that



<P>material; especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required



<P>a sculptor's chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into



<P>petrified severity.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with

his hands



<P>behind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly



<P>his eye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled



<P>or shocked its pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he



<P>had hitherto used-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'r never to any one else shall I seem to possess these charms. He was



<P>fond and proud of me- it is what no man besides will ever be.- But



<P>where am I wandering, and what am I saying, and above all, feeling?



<P>Whether is it better, I ask, to be a slave in a fool's paradise at



<P>Marseilles- fevered with delusive bliss one hour- suffocating with the



<P>bitterest tears of remorse and shame the next- or to be a



<P>village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy mountain nook



<P>in the healthy heart of England?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle

and



<P>law, and scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied



<P>moment. God directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence



<P>for the guidance!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose,

went to



<P>my door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet



<P>fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a



<P>mile from the village. The birds were singing their last strains-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

'The air was mild, the dew was balm.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find



<P>myself ere long weeping- and why? For the doom which had reft me



<P>from adhesion to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the



<P>desperate grief and fatal fury- consequences of my departure- which



<P>might now, perhaps, be dragging him from the path of right, too far

to



<P>leave hope of ultimate restoration thither. At this thought, I



<P>turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of



<P>Morton- I say lonely, for in that bend of it visible to me there was



<P>no building apparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in



<P>trees, and, quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the



<P>rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived. I hid my eyes, and leant my



<P>head against the stone frame of my door; but soon a slight noise



<P>near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond

it



<P>made me look up. A dog- old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer, as I saw in



<P>a moment- was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John himself



<P>leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave



<P>almost to displeasure, fixed on me. I asked him to come in.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel

My



<P>sisters left for you. I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and



<P>paper.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was. He examined

my



<P>face, I thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears



<P>were doubtless very visible upon it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?'

he



<P>asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, no! On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on

with my



<P>scholars very well.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But perhaps your accommodations- your cottage- your furniture-



<P>have disappointed your expectations? They are, in truth, scanty



<P>enough; but-' I interrupted-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient

and



<P>commodious. All I see has made me thankful, not despondent. I am not



<P>absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a



<P>carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had



<P>nothing- I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have



<P>acquaintance, a home, a business. I wonder at the goodness of God; the



<P>generosity of my friends; the bounty of my lot. I do not repine.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you feel solitude an oppression? The little house

there behind



<P>you is dark and empty.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity,



<P>much less to grow impatient under one of loneliness.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at

any rate,



<P>your good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to



<P>the vacillating fears of Lot's wife. What you had left before I saw



<P>you, of course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every



<P>temptation which would incline you to look back: pursue your present



<P>career steadily, for some months at least.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is what I mean to do,' I answered. St. John continued-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is hard work to control the workings of inclination

and turn



<P>the bent of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.



<P>God has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and



<P>when our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get- when



<P>our will strains after a path we may not follow- we need neither



<P>starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek



<P>another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it



<P>longed to taste- and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous



<P>foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up



<P>against us, if rougher than it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I

thought I



<P>had made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties



<P>wearied me to death. I burnt for the more active life of the world-



<P>for the more exciting toils of a literary career- for the destiny of



<P>an artist, author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes,



<P>the heart of a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover



<P>of renown, a luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice. I



<P>considered; my life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must



<P>die. After a season of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief



<P>fell: my cramped existence all at once spread out to a plain without



<P>bounds- my powers heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their



<P>full strength, spread their wings, and mount beyond ken. God had an



<P>errand for me; to bear which afar, to deliver it well, skill and



<P>strength, courage and eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier,



<P>statesman, and orator, were all needed: for these all centre in the



<P>good missionary.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A missionary I resolved to be. From that moment my state

of mind



<P>changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving



<P>nothing of bondage but its galling soreness- which time only can heal.



<P>My father, indeed, opposed the determination, but since his death, I



<P>have not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs



<P>settled, a successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of



<P>the feelings broken through or cut asunder- a last conflict with human



<P>weakness, in which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed



<P>that I will overcome- and I leave Europe for the East.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice;



<P>looking, when he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting



<P>sun, at which I looked too. Both he and I had our backs towards the



<P>path leading up the field to the wicket. We had heard no step on the



<P>grass-grown track; the water running in the vale was the one lulling



<P>sound of the hour and scene; we might well then start when a gay



<P>voice, sweet as a silver bell, exclaimed-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good evening, Mr. Rivers. And good evening, old Carlo.

Your dog is



<P>quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his



<P>ears and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and



<P>you have your back towards me now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was true. Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first

of those



<P>musical accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his



<P>head, he stood yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude



<P>in which the speaker had surprised him- his arm resting on the gate,



<P>his face directed towards the west. He turned at last, with measured



<P>deliberation. A vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.



<P>There appeared, within three feet of him, a form clad in pure



<P>white-a youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and



<P>when, after bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and



<P>threw back a long veil, there bloomed under his glance a face of



<P>perfect beauty. Perfect beauty is a strong expression; but I do not



<P>retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever the temperate clime



<P>of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as ever her humid



<P>gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified, in this



<P>instance, the term. No charm was wanting, no defect was perceptible;



<P>the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes shaped and



<P>coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark, and full;



<P>the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so soft

a



<P>fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the



<P>white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties



<P>of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh



<P>too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth



<P>without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich,



<P>plenteous tresses- all advantages, in short, which, combined,



<P>realise the ideal of beauty, were fully hers. I wondered, as I



<P>looked at this fair creature: I admired her with my whole heart.



<P>Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood; and, forgetting her



<P>usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed this, her



<P>darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel? I

naturally



<P>asked myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her;



<P>and, as naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his



<P>countenance. He had already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was



<P>looking at a humble tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,' he

said, as



<P>he crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.



<P>town some twenty miles distant) 'this afternoon. Papa told me you



<P>had opened your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I



<P>put on my bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this



<P>is she?' pointing to me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is,' said St. John.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you think you shall like Morton?' she asked of me,

with a



<P>direct and naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if



<P>child-like.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hope I shall. I have many inducements to do so.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Quite.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you like your house?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very much.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have I furnished it nicely?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very nicely, indeed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice

Wood?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have indeed. She is teachable and handy.' (This then,

I



<P>thought, is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts



<P>of fortune, as well as in those of nature! What happy combination of



<P>the planets presided over her birth, I wonder?)



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes,' she

added. 'It



<P>will be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a



<P>night, or rather this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock. The



<P>are the most agreeable men in the world: they put all our young



<P>knife-grinders and scissor merchants to shame.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded,

and his



<P>upper lip curled a moment. His mouth certainly looked a good deal



<P>compressed, and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square,



<P>as the laughing girl gave him this information. He lifted his gaze,



<P>too, from the daisies, and turned it on her. An unsmiling, a



<P>searching, a meaning gaze it was. She answered it with a second laugh,



<P>and laughter well became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright



<P>eyes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing

Carlo.



<P>'Poor Carlo loves me,' said she. 'He is not stern and distant to his



<P>friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace

before



<P>his young and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.



<P>I saw his solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with



<P>resistless emotion. Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as



<P>beautiful for a man as she for a woman. His chest heaved once, as if



<P>his large heart, weary of despotic constriction, had expanded, despite



<P>the will, and made a vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty. But



<P>he curbed it, I think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.



<P>He responded neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances



<P>made him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Papa says you never come to see us now,' continued Mis

Oliver,



<P>looking up. 'You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall. He is alone this



<P>evening, and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,'

answered



<P>St. John.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not a seasonable hour! But I declare it is. It is just

the hour



<P>when papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has



<P>no business to occupy him. Now, Mr. Rivers, do come. Why are you so



<P>very shy, and so very sombre?' She filled up the hiatus his silence



<P>left by a reply of her own.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I forgot!' she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled

head, as if



<P>shocked at herself. 'I am so giddy and thoughtless! Do excuse me. It



<P>had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed



<P>for joining in my chatter. Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor



<P>House is shut up, and you are so lonely. I am sure I pity you. Do come



<P>and see papa.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only

knew



<P>the effort it cost him thus to refuse.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I

dare not



<P>stay any longer: the dew begins to fall. Good evening!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She held out her hand. He just touched it. 'Good evening!'

he



<P>repeated, in a voice low and hollow as an echo. She turned, but in a



<P>moment returned.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you well?' she asked. Well might she put the question:

his



<P>face was blanched as her gown.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Quite well,' he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the

gate. She



<P>went one way; he another. She turned twice to gaze after him as she



<P>tripped fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across,



<P>never turned at all.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt

my



<P>thoughts from exclusive meditation on my own. Diana Rivers had



<P>designated her brother 'inexorable as death.' She had not exaggerated.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and

the



<P>Sibyl- if Sibyl she were- was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair

at



<P>the chimney-corner. She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or



<P>rather, a broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped



<P>handkerchief under her chin. An extinguished candle stood on the



<P>table; she was bending over the fire, and seemed reading in a little



<P>black book, like a prayer-book, by the light of the blaze: she



<P>muttered the words to herself, as most old women do, while she read;



<P>she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it appeared she



<P>wished to finish a paragraph.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather

cold with



<P>sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire. I felt now as



<P>composed as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the



<P>gipsy's appearance to trouble one's calm. She shut her book and slowly



<P>looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see,

as



<P>she raised it, that it was a strange one. It looked all brown and



<P>black: elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed



<P>under her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye



<P>confronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, and you want your fortune told?' she said, in a

voice as



<P>decided as her glance, as harsh as her features.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself:

but I



<P>ought to warn you, I have no faith.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you;

I



<P>heard it in your step as you crossed the threshold.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you? You've a quick ear.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You need them all in your trade.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal

with. Why



<P>don't you tremble?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'm not cold.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why don't you turn pale?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am not sick.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why don't you consult my art?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'm not silly.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The old crone 'nichered' a laugh under her bonnet and bandage;



<P>she then drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to



<P>smoke. Having indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent



<P>body, took the pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the



<P>fire, said very deliberately-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Prove it,' I rejoined.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will, in few words. You are cold, because you are alone:

no



<P>contact strikes the fire from you that is in you. You are sick;



<P>because the best of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to



<P>man, keeps far away from you. You are silly, because, suffer as you



<P>may, you will not beckon it to approach, nor will you stir one step

to



<P>meet it where it waits you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed

her



<P>smoking with vigour.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You might say all that to almost any one who you knew

lived as a



<P>solitary dependant in a great house.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true

of almost



<P>any one?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In my circumstances.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; just so, in your circumstances: but find me another

precisely



<P>placed as you are.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It would be easy to find you thousands.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You could scarcely find me one. If you knew it, you are

peculiarly



<P>situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it. The



<P>materials are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine



<P>them. Chance laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and



<P>bliss results.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't understand enigmas. I never could guess a riddle

in my



<P>life.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To be sure.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot

which



<P>she took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned



<P>it, she told me to hold out my hand. I did. She approached her face

to



<P>the palm, and pored over it without touching it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is too fine,' said she. 'I can make nothing of such

a hand as



<P>that; almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm? Destiny is not



<P>written there.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe you,' said I.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No,' she continued, 'it is in the face: on the forehead,

about the



<P>eyes, in the eyes themselves, in the lines of the mouth. Kneel, and



<P>lift up your head.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! now you are coming to reality,' I said, as I obeyed

her. 'I



<P>shall begin to put some faith in you presently.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I knelt within half a yard of her. She stirred the fire,

so that



<P>a ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however,



<P>as she sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it



<P>illumined.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night,'

she said,



<P>when she had examined me a while. 'I wonder what thoughts are busy



<P>in your heart during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the



<P>fine people flitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just



<P>as little sympathetic communion passing between you and them as if



<P>they were really mere shadows of human forms, and not the actual



<P>substance.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please

you



<P>with whispers of the future?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not I. The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out

of my



<P>earnings to set up a school some day in a little house rented by



<P>myself.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting

in that



<P>window-seat (you see I know your habits)-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have learned them from the servants.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! you think yourself sharp. Well, perhaps I have: to

speak



<P>truth, I have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I started to my feet when I heard the name.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have- have you?' thought I; 'there is diablerie in

the



<P>business after all, then!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't be alarmed,' continued the strange being; 'she's

a safe hand



<P>&nbsp;is Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence

in her.



<P>But, as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of



<P>nothing but your future school? Have you no present interest in any

of



<P>the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you? Is there not



<P>one face you study? one figure whose movements you follow with at



<P>least curiosity?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I like to observe all the faces and all the figures.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But do you never single one from the rest-or it may be,

two?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair

seem telling



<P>a tale: it amuses me to watch them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What tale do you like best to hear?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, I have not much choice! They generally run on the

same



<P>theme- courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe-



<P>marriage.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And do you like that monotonous theme?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing to you? When a lady, young and full of life and

health,



<P>charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune,



<P>sits and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I what?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You know- and perhaps think well of.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't know the gentlemen here. I have scarcely interchanged

a



<P>syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider



<P>some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,



<P>dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty



<P>to be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling



<P>disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You don't know the gentlemen here? You have not exchanged

a



<P>syllable with one of them? Will you say that of the master of the



<P>house!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is not at home.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A profound remark! A most ingenious quibble! He went to

Millcote



<P>this morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that



<P>circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance- blot him,



<P>as it were, out of existence?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do

with the



<P>theme you had introduced.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen;

and of



<P>late so many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they



<P>overflow like two cups filled above the brim: have you never



<P>remarked that?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his

guests.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No question about his right: but have you never observed

that,



<P>of all the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been



<P>favoured with the most lively and the most continuous?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.'



<P>I said this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk,



<P>voice, manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream. One



<P>unexpected sentence came from her lips after another, till I got



<P>involved in a web of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit



<P>had been sitting for weeks by my heart watching its workings and



<P>taking record of every pulse.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Eagerness of a listener!' repeated she: 'yes; Mr. Rochester

has



<P>sat by the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took



<P>such delight in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was



<P>so willing to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given



<P>him; you have noticed this?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Grateful! I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his

face.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Detecting! You have analysed, then. And what did you detect,

if



<P>not gratitude?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I said nothing.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have seen love: have you not?- and, looking forward,

you



<P>have seen him married, and beheld his bride happy?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Humph! Not exactly. Your witch's skill is rather at fault



<P>sometimes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What the devil have you seen, then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess. Is

it known



<P>that Mr. Rochester is to be married?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shortly?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt



<P>(though, with an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem



<P>to question it), they will be a superlatively happy pair. He must love



<P>such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she



<P>loves him, or, if not his person, at least his purse. I know she



<P>considers the Rochester estate eligible to the last degree; though



<P>(God pardon me!) I told her something on that point about an hour



<P>ago which made her look wondrous grave: the corners of her mouth



<P>fell half an inch. I would advise her black-aviced suitor to look out:



<P>if another comes, with a longer or clearer rent-roll,- he's dished-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune:

I



<P>came to hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face,

one trait



<P>contradicted another. Chance has meted you a measure of happiness:



<P>that I know. I knew it before I came here this evening. She has laid



<P>it carefully on one side for you. I saw her do it. It depends on



<P>yourself to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you



<P>will do so, is the problem I study. Kneel again on the rug.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I knelt. She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed,

leaning back



<P>in her chair. She began muttering,-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew;

it looks



<P>soft and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon; it is susceptible;



<P>impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it



<P>ceases to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the



<P>lid: that signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness. It turns



<P>from me; it will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a



<P>mocking glance, the truth of the discoveries I have already made,-



<P>to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and



<P>reserve only confirm me in my opinion. The eye is favourable.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it

is



<P>disposed to impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it



<P>would be silent on much the heart experiences. Mobile and flexible,

it



<P>was never intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of



<P>solitude; it is a mouth which should speak much and smile often, and



<P>have human affection for its interlocutor. That feature too is



<P>propitious.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and

that brow



<P>professes to say,- "I can live alone, if self-respect and



<P>circumstances require me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy



<P>bliss. I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive



<P>if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a



<P>price I cannot afford to give." The forehead declares, "Reason sits



<P>firm and holds the reins, and she will not let the feelings burst away



<P>and hurry her to wild chasms. The passions may rage furiously, like



<P>true heathens, as they are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of



<P>vain things: but judgment shall still have the last word in every



<P>argument, and the casting vote in every decision. Strong wind,



<P>earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but I shall follow the guiding



<P>of that still small voice which interprets the dictates of



<P>conscience."



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.

I have



<P>formed my plans- right plans I deem them- and in them I have



<P>attended to the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason. I know



<P>how soon youth would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss



<P>offered, but one dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were



<P>detected; and I do not want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution- such is



<P>not my taste. I wish to foster, not to blight- to earn gratitude,



<P>not to wring tears of blood- no, nor of brine: my harvest must be in



<P>smiles, in endearments, in sweet- That will do. I think I rave in a



<P>kind of exquisite delirium. I should wish now to protract this



<P>moment ad infinitum; but I dare not. So far I have governed myself



<P>thoroughly. I have acted as I inwardly swore I would act; but



<P>further might try me beyond my strength. Rise, Miss Eyre: leave me;



<P>"the play is played out."'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Where was I? Did I wake or sleep? Had I been dreaming?

Did I



<P>dream still? The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her



<P>gesture, and all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass- as the



<P>speech of my own tongue. I got up, but did not go. I looked; I stirred



<P>the fire, and I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her



<P>bandage closer about her face, and again beckoned me to depart. The



<P>flame illuminated her hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert



<P>for discoveries, I at once noticed that hand. It was no more the



<P>withered limb of eld than my own; it was a rounded supple member, with



<P>smooth fingers, symmetrically turned; a broad ring flashed on the



<P>little finger, and stooping forward, I looked at it, and saw a gem I



<P>had seen a hundred times before. Again I looked at the face; which was



<P>no longer turned from me- on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed,



<P>the bandage displaced, the head advanced.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, Jane, do you know me?' asked the familiar voice.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But the string is in a knot- help me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Break it, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There, then- "Off, ye lendings!"' And Mr. Rochester stepped

out of



<P>his disguise.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, sir, what a strange idea!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But well carried out, eh? Don't you think so?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With the ladies you must have managed well.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But not with you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You did not act the character of a gipsy with me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What character did I act? My own?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; some unaccountable one. In short, I believe you have

been



<P>trying to draw me out- or in; you have been talking nonsense to make



<P>me talk nonsense. It is scarcely fair, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you forgive me, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot tell till I have thought it all over. If, on



<P>reflection, I find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall



<P>try to forgive you; but it was not right.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, you have been very correct- very careful, very sensible.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had. It was a

comfort;



<P>but, indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the



<P>interview. Something of masquerade I suspected. I knew gipsies and



<P>fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman



<P>had expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her



<P>anxiety to conceal her features. But my mind had been running on Grace



<P>Poole- that living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I



<P>considered her. I had never thought of Mr. Rochester.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well,' said he, 'what are you musing about? What does

that grave



<P>smile signify?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Wonder and self-congratulation, sir. I have your permission

to



<P>retire now, I suppose?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the

drawing-room



<P>yonder are doing.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Discussing the gipsy, I daresay.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sit down!- Let me hear what they said about me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven

o'clock.



<P>Oh, are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here



<P>since you left this morning?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A stranger!- no; who can it be? I expected no one; is

he gone?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take

the



<P>liberty of installing himself here till you returned.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The devil he did! Did he give his name?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies;

from



<P>Spanish Town, in Jamaica, I think.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand,

as if



<P>to lead me to a chair. As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive



<P>grip; the smile on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his



<P>breath.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mason!- the West Indies!' he said, in the tone one might

fancy a



<P>speaking automaton to enounce its single words; 'Mason!- the West



<P>Indies!' he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,



<P>growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly



<P>seemed to know what he was doing.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you feel ill, sir?' I inquired.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!' He staggered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, lean on me, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me

have it



<P>now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, yes; and my arm.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He sat down, and made me sit beside him. Holding my hand

in both



<P>his own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most



<P>troubled and dreary look.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My little friend!' said he, 'I wish I were in a quiet

island



<P>with only you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections



<P>removed from me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can I help you, sir?- I'd give my life to serve you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I

promise



<P>you that.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you, sir. Tell me what to do,- I'll try, at least,

to do



<P>it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room:

they



<P>will be at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what



<P>he is doing.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went. I found all the party in the dining-room at supper,

as



<P>Mr. Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,- the supper was



<P>arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they



<P>stood about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in



<P>their hands. Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and



<P>conversation were general and animated. Mr. Mason stood near the fire,



<P>talking to Colonel and Mrs. Dent, and appeared as merry as any of



<P>them. I filled a wine-glass (I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly



<P>as I did so: she thought I was taking a liberty, I daresay), and I



<P>returned to the library.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he

looked



<P>once more firm and stern. He took the glass from my hand.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!' he said. He



<P>swallowed the contents and returned it to me. 'What are they doing,



<P>Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Laughing and talking, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard



<P>something strange?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And Mason?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He was laughing too.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what

would



<P>you do, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He half smiled. 'But if I were to go to them, and they

only



<P>looked at me coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other,



<P>and then dropped off and left me one by one, what then? Would you go



<P>with them?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in

staying



<P>with you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To comfort me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and

if I did,



<P>I should care nothing about it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, you could dare censure for my sake?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved

my



<P>adherence; as you, I am sure, do.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and

whisper



<P>in his ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show



<P>him in here and then leave me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did his behest. The company all stared at me as I passed

straight



<P>among them. I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded



<P>him from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went



<P>upstairs.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard

the



<P>visitors repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's



<P>voice, and heard him say, 'This way, Mason; this is your room.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.

I was soon



<P>asleep.

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER XVIII</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; MERRY days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days

too: how



<P>different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and



<P>solitude I had passed beneath its roof! All sad feelings seemed now



<P>driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was



<P>life everywhere, movement all day long. You could not now traverse the



<P>gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so



<P>tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the



<P>entrance hall, were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void



<P>and still when the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial



<P>spring weather called their occupants out into the grounds. Even



<P>when that weather was broken, and continuous rain set in for some



<P>days, no damp seemed cast over enjoyment: indoor amusements only



<P>became more lively and varied, in consequence of the stop put to



<P>outdoor gaiety.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wondered what they were going to do the first evening

a change of



<P>entertainment was proposed: they spoke of 'playing charades,' but in



<P>my ignorance I did not understand the term. The servants were called



<P>in, the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise



<P>disposed, the chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch. While



<P>Mr. Rochester and the other gentlemen directed these alterations,



<P>the ladies were running up and down stairs ringing for their maids.



<P>Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to give information respecting the resources



<P>of the house in shawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain



<P>wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and their contents, in



<P>the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black



<P>modes, lace lappets, etc., were brought down in armfuls by the



<P>abigails; then a selection was made, and such things as were chosen



<P>were carried to the boudoir within the drawing-room.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round

him,



<P>and was selecting certain of their number to be of his party. 'Miss



<P>Ingram is mine, of course,' said he: afterwards he named the two



<P>Misses Eshton, and Mrs. Dent. He looked at me: I happened to be near



<P>him, as I had been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet,



<P>which had got loose.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will you play?' he asked. I shook my head. He did not

insist,



<P>which I rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return



<P>quietly to my usual seat.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other

party,



<P>which was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of



<P>chairs. One of the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to



<P>propose that I should be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly



<P>negatived the notion.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No,' I heard her say: 'she looks too stupid for any game

of the



<P>sort.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up. Within

the



<P>arch, the bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had



<P>likewise chosen, was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on

a



<P>table, lay open a large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped



<P>in Mr. Rochester's cloak, and holding a book in her hand. Somebody,



<P>unseen, rang the bell merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being



<P>one of her guardian's party), bounded forward, scattering round her



<P>the contents of a basket of flowers she carried on her arm. Then



<P>appeared the magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a



<P>long veil on her head, and a wreath of roses round her brow; by her



<P>side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they drew near the table. They



<P>knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white,



<P>took up their stations behind them. A ceremony followed, in dumb show,



<P>in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime of a marriage. At



<P>its termination, Colonel Dent, and his party consulted in whispers for



<P>two minutes, then the Colonel called out-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Bride!' Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its

second



<P>rising displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.



<P>The drawing-room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps



<P>above the dining-room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard



<P>or two back within the room, appeared a large marble basin, which I



<P>recognised as an ornament of the conservatory- where it usually stood,



<P>surrounded by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish- and whence it must



<P>have been transported with some trouble, on account of its size and



<P>weight.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen

Mr.



<P>Rochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head. His dark



<P>eyes and swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume



<P>exactly: he looked the very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a



<P>victim of the bowstring. Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.



<P>She, too, was attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied



<P>sash-like round the waist; an embroidered handkerchief knotted about



<P>her temples; her beautifully moulded arms bare, one of them upraised



<P>in the act of supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.



<P>Both her cast of form and feature, her complexion and her general air,



<P>suggested the idea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal



<P>days; and such was doubtless the character she intended to represent.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill

her



<P>pitcher; she again lifted it to her head. The personage on the



<P>well-brink now seemed to accost her; to make some request:- 'She



<P>hasted, let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.' From



<P>the bosom of his robe he then produced a casket, opened it and



<P>showed magnificent bracelets and earrings; she acted astonishment



<P>and admiration; kneeling, he laid the treasure at her feet;



<P>incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks and gestures;



<P>the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the rings in her



<P>ears. It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were wanting.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently

they



<P>could not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.



<P>Colonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded 'the tableau of the whole';



<P>whereupon the curtain again descended.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room

was



<P>disclosed; the rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort



<P>of dark and coarse drapery. The marble basin was removed; in its place



<P>stood a deal table and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible



<P>by a very dim light proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles



<P>being all extinguished.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands

resting



<P>on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground. I knew Mr. Rochester;



<P>though the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose



<P>from one arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a



<P>scuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance the rough,



<P>bristling hair might well have disguised him. As he moved, a chain



<P>clanked; to his wrists were attached fetters.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Bridewell!' exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was

solved.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers

to resume



<P>their ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room. Mr. Rochester



<P>led in Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you know,' said she, 'that, of the three characters,

I liked



<P>you in the last best? Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier,



<P>what a gallant gentleman-highwayman you would have made!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is all the soot washed from my face?' he asked, turning

it towards



<P>her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Alas! yes: the more's the pity! Nothing could be more

becoming



<P>to your complexion than that ruffian's rouge.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You would like a hero of the road then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'An English hero of the road would be the next best thing

to an



<P>Italian bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine



<P>pirate.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were

married



<P>an hour since, in the presence of all these witnesses.' She giggled,



<P>and her colour rose.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, Dent,' continued Mr. Rochester, 'it is your turn.'

And as the



<P>other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats. Miss



<P>Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners



<P>filled the chairs on each side of him and her. I did not now watch the



<P>actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my



<P>attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on



<P>the arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.



<P>What charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they



<P>chose, how they acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I



<P>still see the consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr.



<P>Rochester turn to Miss Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her



<P>incline her head towards him, till the jetty curls almost touch his



<P>shoulder and wave against his cheek; I hear their mutual



<P>whisperings; I recall their interchanged glances; and something even



<P>of the feeling roused by the spectacle returns in memory at this



<P>moment.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr.

Rochester: I



<P>could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased

to



<P>notice me- because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would



<P>never once turn his eyes in my direction- because I saw all his



<P>attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me



<P>with the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and



<P>imperious eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as



<P>from an object too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove



<P>him, because I felt sure he would soon marry this very lady- because

I



<P>read daily in her a proud security in his intentions respecting her-



<P>because I witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which, if



<P>careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in



<P>its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very pride,



<P>irresistible.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances,



<P>though much to create despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to



<P>engender jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be



<P>jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram's. But I was not jealous: or very



<P>rarely;- the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by



<P>that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too



<P>inferior to excite the feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean



<P>what I say. She was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a



<P>fine person, many brilliant attainments; but her mind was poor, her



<P>heart barren by nature: nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil;

no



<P>unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness. She was not good;



<P>she was not original: she used to repeat sounding phrases from



<P>books: she never offered, nor had, an opinion of her own. She



<P>advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did not know the



<P>sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her.



<P>Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a



<P>spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her



<P>away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;



<P>sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with



<P>coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these



<P>manifestations of character- watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.



<P>Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over



<P>his intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this



<P>sagacity- this guardedness of his- this perfect, clear consciousness



<P>of his fair one's defects- this obvious absence of passion in his



<P>sentiments towards her, that my ever-torturing pain arose.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political



<P>reasons, because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had



<P>not given her his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted



<P>to win from him that treasure. This was the point- this was where



<P>the nerve was touched and teased- this was where the fever was



<P>sustained and fed: she could not charm him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded

and



<P>sincerely laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face,



<P>turned to the wall, and (figuratively) have died to them. If Miss



<P>Ingram had been a good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour,



<P>kindness, sense, I should have had one vital struggle with two tigers-



<P>jealousy and despair: then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should



<P>have admired her- acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for



<P>the rest of my days: and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper



<P>would have been my admiration- the more truly tranquil my



<P>quiescence. But as matters really stood, to watch Miss Ingram's



<P>efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to witness their repeated



<P>failure- herself unconscious that they did fail; vainly fancying



<P>that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly pluming



<P>herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled



<P>further and further what she wished to allure- to witness this, was

to



<P>be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.



<P>Arrows that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and



<P>fell harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand,



<P>have quivered keen in his proud heart- have called love into his stern



<P>eye, and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without



<P>weapons a silent conquest might have been won.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged

to draw



<P>so near to him?' I asked myself. 'Surely she cannot truly like him,

or



<P>not like him with true affection! If she did, she need not coin her



<P>smiles so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture



<P>airs so elaborate, graces so multitudinous. It seems to me that she



<P>might, by merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and



<P>looking less, get nigher his heart. I have seen in his face a far



<P>different expression from that which hardens it now while she is so



<P>vivaciously accosting him; but then it came of itself: it was not



<P>elicited by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had



<P>but to accept it- to answer what he asked without pretension, to



<P>address him when needful without grimace- and it increased and grew



<P>kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a fostering sunbeam. How



<P>will she manage to please him when they are married? I do not think



<P>she will manage it; and yet it might be managed; and his wife might,

I



<P>verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun shines on.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's



<P>project of marrying for interest and connections. It surprised me when



<P>I first discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a



<P>man unlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his



<P>choice of a wife; but the longer I considered the position, education,



<P>etc., of the parties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming



<P>either him or Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and



<P>principles instilled into them, doubtless, from their childhood. All



<P>their class held these principles: I supposed, then, they had



<P>reasons for holding them such as I could not fathom. It seemed to me



<P>that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take to my bosom only



<P>such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of the



<P>advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan



<P>convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption



<P>of which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world



<P>would act as I wished to act.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very

lenient to



<P>my master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once



<P>kept a sharp look-out. It had formerly been my endeavour to study



<P>all sides of his character: to take the bad with the good; and from



<P>the just weighing of both, to form an equitable judgment. Now I saw

no



<P>bad. The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled

me



<P>once, were only like keen condiments in a choice dish: their



<P>presence was pungent, but their absence would be felt as comparatively



<P>insipid. And as for the vague something- was it a sinister or a



<P>sorrowful, a designing or a desponding expression?- that opened upon

a



<P>careful observer, now and then, in his eye, and closed again before



<P>one could fathom the strange depth partially disclosed; that something



<P>which used to make me fear and shrink, as if I had been wandering



<P>amongst volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly felt the ground



<P>quiver and seen it gape: that something, I, at intervals, beheld



<P>still; and with throbbing heart, but not with palsied nerves.



<P>Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare- to divine it; and

I



<P>thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might look into the



<P>abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their nature.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future

bride-



<P>saw only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their



<P>movements of importance- the rest of the party were occupied with



<P>their own separate interests and pleasures. The Ladies Lynn and Ingram



<P>continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their



<P>two turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting



<P>gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme

on



<P>which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets. Mild Mrs.



<P>Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes



<P>bestowed a courteous word or smile on me. Sir George Lynn, Colonel



<P>Dent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice



<P>business. Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and



<P>sang to and with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened



<P>languidly to the gallant speeches of the other. Sometimes all, as with



<P>one consent, suspended their by-play to observe and listen to the



<P>principal actors: for, after all, Mr. Rochester and- because closely



<P>connected with him- Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party.



<P>If he was absent from the room an hour, a perceptible dulness seemed



<P>to steal over the spirits of his guests; and his re-entrance was



<P>sure to give a fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly



<P>felt one day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and



<P>was not likely to return till late. The afternoon was wet: a walk



<P>the party had proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched



<P>on a common beyond Hay, was consequently deferred. Some of the



<P>gentlemen were gone to the stables: the younger ones, together with



<P>the younger ladies, were playing billiards in the billiard-room. The



<P>dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought solace in a quiet game at cards.



<P>Blanche Ingram, after having repelled, by supercilious taciturnity,



<P>some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to draw her into



<P>conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental tunes and



<P>airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the



<P>library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and



<P>prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of



<P>absence. The room and the house were silent: only now and then the



<P>merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was verging on dusk, and the dock had already given

warning of



<P>the hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in



<P>the drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Voila Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa:

the



<P>others, too, looked up from their several occupations; for at the same



<P>time a crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became



<P>audible on the wet gravel. A post-chaise was approaching.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What can possess him to come home in that style?' said

Miss



<P>Ingram. 'He rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went



<P>out? and Pilot was with him:- what has he done with the animals?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample

garments



<P>so near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the



<P>breaking of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at



<P>first, but when she did, she curled her lip and moved to another



<P>casement. The post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell,



<P>and a gentleman alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not



<P>Mr. Rochester; it was a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How provoking!' exclaimed Miss Ingram: 'you tiresome monkey!'



<P>(apostrophising Adele), 'who perched you up in the window to give



<P>false intelligence?' and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I



<P>were in fault.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the newcomer



<P>entered. He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady



<P>present.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,' said

he, 'when



<P>my friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very



<P>long journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate



<P>acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck

me as



<P>being somewhat unusual,- not precisely foreign, but still not



<P>altogether English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,- between



<P>thirty and forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he



<P>was a fine-looking man, at first sight especially. On closer



<P>examination, you detected something in his face that displeased, or



<P>rather that failed to please. His features were regular, but too



<P>relaxed: his eye was large and well cut, but the life looking out of



<P>it was a tame, vacant life- at least so I thought.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. It

was not till



<P>after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.



<P>But I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as



<P>being at the same time unsettled and inanimate. His eye wandered,



<P>and had no meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such



<P>as I never remembered to have seen. For a handsome and not an



<P>unamiable-looking man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no



<P>power in that smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness

in



<P>that aquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the



<P>low, even forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light

of



<P>the girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him- for he



<P>occupied an arm-chair drawn close to the fire and kept shrinking still



<P>nearer, as if he were cold- I compared him with Mr. Rochester. I think



<P>(with deference be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater



<P>between a sleek gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and



<P>the rough-coated keen-eyed dog, its guardian.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend. A curious



<P>friendship theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of



<P>the old adage that 'extremes meet.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught

at times



<P>scraps of their conversation across the room. At first I could not



<P>make much sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton



<P>and Mary Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary



<P>sentences that reached me at intervals. These last were discussing the



<P>stranger; they both called him 'a beautiful man.' Louisa said he was



<P>'a love of a creature,' and she 'adored him'; and Mary instanced his



<P>'pretty little mouth, and nice nose,' as her ideal of the charming.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what a sweet-tempered forehead he hast' cried Louisa,-

'so



<P>smooth- none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and



<P>such a placid eye and smile!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them

to the



<P>other side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred



<P>excursion to Hay Common.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group

by the



<P>fire, and I presently gathered that the newcomer was called Mr. Mason;



<P>then I learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he



<P>came from some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his



<P>face was so sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a



<P>surtout in the house. Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish



<P>Town, indicated the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no



<P>little surprise I gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and



<P>become acquainted with Mr. Rochester. He spoke of his friend's dislike



<P>of the burning heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that



<P>region. I knew Mr. Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had



<P>said so; but I thought the continent of Europe had bounded his



<P>wanderings; till now I had never heard a hint given of visits to



<P>more distant shores.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat



<P>unexpected one, broke the thread of my musings. Mr. Mason, shivering



<P>as some one chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put

on



<P>the fire, which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder



<P>still shone hot and red. The footman who brought the coal, in going



<P>out, stopped near Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a



<P>low voice, of which I heard only the words, 'old woman,'- 'quite



<P>troublesome.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not

take



<P>herself off,' replied the magistrate.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No- stop!' interrupted Colonel Dent. 'Don't send her away,

Eshton;



<P>we might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies.' And



<P>speaking aloud, he continued- 'Ladies, you talked of going to Hay



<P>Common to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old



<P>Mother Bunches is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists



<P>upon being brought in before "the quality," to tell them their



<P>fortunes. Would you like to see her?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Surely, colonel,' cried Lady Ingram, 'you would not encourage

such



<P>a low impostor? Dismiss her, by all means, at once!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady,' said the



<P>footman; 'nor can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just



<P>now, entreating her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the



<P>chimney-corner, and says nothing shall stir her from it till she



<P>gets leave to come in here.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What does she want?' asked Mrs. Eshton.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"To tell the gentry their fortunes," she says, ma'am;

and she



<P>swears she must and will do it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is she like?' inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black

as a crock.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, she's a real sorceress!' cried Frederick Lynn. 'Let

us have



<P>her in, of course.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To be sure,' rejoined his brother; 'it would be a thousand



<P>pities to throw away such a chance of fun.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My dear boys, what are you thinking about?' exclaimed

Mrs. Lynn.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding,'



<P>chimed in the Dowager Ingram.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed, mama, but you can- and will,' pronounced the haughty

voice



<P>of Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she



<P>had sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music. 'I have

a



<P>curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame



<P>forward.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My darling Blanche! recollect-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do- I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have

my will-



<P>quick, Sam!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes- yes- yes!' cried all the juveniles, both ladies and



<P>gentlemen. 'Let her come- it will be excellent sport!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The footman still lingered. 'She looks such a rough one,'

said he.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go!' ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running

fire of



<P>raillery and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She won't come now,' said he. 'She says it's not her mission

to



<P>appear before the "vulgar herd" (them's her words). I must show her



<P>into a room by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must

go



<P>to her one by one.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You see now, my queenly Blanche,' began Lady Ingram, 'she



<P>encroaches. Be advised, my angel girl- and-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Show her into the library, of course,' cut in the 'angel

girl,'



<P>'It is not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd



<P>either: I mean to have her all to myself. Is there a fire in the



<P>library?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, ma'am- but she looks such a tinkler.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation

rose to



<P>full flow once more.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She's ready now,' said the footman, as he reappeared.

'She



<P>wishes to know who will be her first visitor.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think I had better just look in upon her before any

of the



<P>ladies go,' said Colonel Dent.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sam went and returned.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need

not



<P>trouble themselves to come near her; nor,' he added, with difficulty



<P>suppressing a titter, 'any ladies either, except the young and



<P>single.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'By Jove, she has taste!' exclaimed Henry Lynn.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Ingram rose solemnly: 'I go first,' she said, in a

tone



<P>which might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a



<P>breach in the van of his men.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause- reflect!' was her

mama's



<P>cry; but she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the



<P>door which Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A comparative silence ensued. Lady Ingram thought it 'le

cas' to



<P>wring her hands: which she did accordingly. Miss Mary declared she



<P>felt, for her part, she never dared venture. Amy and Louisa Eshton



<P>tittered under their breath, and looked a little frightened.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before

the



<P>library-door again opened. Miss Ingram returned to us through the



<P>arch.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Would she laugh? Would she take it as a joke? All eyes

met her with



<P>a glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff



<P>and coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked



<P>stiffly to her seat, and took it in silence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, Blanche?' said Lord Ingram.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What did she say, sister?' asked Mary.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What did you think? How do you feel? Is she a real



<P>fortune-teller?' demanded the Misses Eshton.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, now, good people,' returned Miss Ingram, 'don't press

upon



<P>me. Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you



<P>seem, by the importance you all- my good mama included- ascribe to



<P>this matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the



<P>house, who is in close alliance with the old gentleman. I have seen



<P>a gipsy vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science



<P>of palmistry and told me what such people usually tell. My whim is



<P>gratified; and now I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in



<P>the stocks to-morrow morning, as he threatened.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so

declined



<P>further conversation. I watched her for nearly half an hour: during



<P>all that time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently



<P>darker, more dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of



<P>disappointment. She had obviously not heard anything to her advantage:



<P>and it seemed to me, from her prolonged fit of gloom and



<P>taciturnity, that she herself, notwithstanding her professed



<P>indifference, attached undue importance to whatever revelations had



<P>been made her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared

they dared



<P>not go alone; and yet they all wished to go. A negotiation was



<P>opened through the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much



<P>pacing to and fro, till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have



<P>ached with the exercise, permission was at last, with great



<P>difficulty, extorted from the rigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait



<P>upon her in a body.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been:

we heard



<P>hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library;



<P>and at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and



<P>came running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their



<P>wits.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am sure she is something not right!' they cried, one

and all.



<P>'She told us such things! She knows all about us!' and they sank



<P>breathless into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring



<P>them.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had

told them of



<P>things they had said and done when they were mere children;



<P>described books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home:



<P>keepsakes that different relations had presented to them. They



<P>affirmed that she had even divined their thoughts, and had whispered



<P>in the ear of each the name of the person she liked best in the world,



<P>and informed them of what they most wished for.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to

be



<P>further enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got



<P>only blushes, ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for



<P>their importunity. The matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and



<P>wielded fans; and again and again reiterated the expression of their



<P>concern that their warning had not been taken in time; and the elder



<P>gentlemen laughed, and the younger urged their services on the



<P>agitated fair ones.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears

were fully



<P>engaged in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I



<P>turned, and saw Sam.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is

another



<P>young single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she



<P>swears she will not go till she has seen all. I thought it must be



<P>you: there is no one else for it. What shall I tell her?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, I will go by all means,' I answered: and I was glad

of the



<P>unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity. I slipped



<P>out of the room, unobserved by any eye- for the company were



<P>gathered in one mass about the trembling trio just returned- and I



<P>closed the door quietly behind me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you like, miss,' said Sam, 'I'll wait in the hall for

you;



<P>and if she frightens you, just call and I'll come in.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least

afraid.' Nor



<P>was I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.

CHAPTER XXX</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better

I liked



<P>them. In a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could



<P>sit up all day, and walk out sometimes. I could join with Diana and



<P>Mary in all their occupations; converse with them as much as they



<P>wished, and aid them when and where they would allow me. There was a



<P>reviving pleasure in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me



<P>for the first time- the pleasure arising from perfect congeniality



<P>of tastes, sentiments, and principles.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed,



<P>delighted me; what they approved, I reverenced. They loved their



<P>sequestered home. I, too, in the grey, small, antique structure,



<P>with its low roof, its latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its



<P>avenue of aged firs- all grown aslant under the stress of mountain



<P>winds; its garden, dark with yew and holly- and where no flowers but



<P>of the hardiest species would bloom- found a charm both potent and



<P>permanent. They clung to the purple moors behind and around their



<P>dwelling- to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path leading



<P>from their gate descended, and which wound between fern-banks first,



<P>and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields that



<P>ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a flock



<P>of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced lambs:- they



<P>clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of attachment.

I



<P>could comprehend the feeling, and share both its strength and truth.

I



<P>saw the fascination of the locality. I felt the consecration of its



<P>loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell and sweep- on the



<P>wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss, by



<P>heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow



<P>granite crag. These details were just to me what they were to them-

so



<P>many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast and the soft



<P>breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and



<P>sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in



<P>these regions, the same attraction as for them- wound round my



<P>faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Indoors we agreed equally well. They were both more accomplished



<P>and better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the



<P>path of knowledge they had trodden before me. I devoured the books



<P>they lent me: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in



<P>the evening what I had perused during the day. Thought fitted thought;



<P>opinion met opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was

Diana.



<P>Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.



<P>In her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty



<P>of flow, such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.



<P>I could talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush

of



<P>vivacity and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's



<P>feet, to rest my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and



<P>Mary, while they sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but



<P>touched. Diana offered to teach me German. I liked to learn of her:



<P>I saw the part of instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar



<P>pleased and suited me no less. Our natures dovetailed: mutual



<P>affection- of the strongest kind- was the result. They discovered I



<P>could draw: their pencils and colour-boxes were immediately at my



<P>service. My skill, greater in this one point than theirs, surprised



<P>and charmed them. Mary would sit and watch me by the hour together:



<P>then she would take lessons; and a docile, intelligent, assiduous



<P>pupil she made. Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed



<P>like hours, and weeks like days.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As to Mr. St. John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally



<P>and rapidly between me and his sisters did not extend to him. One



<P>reason of the distance yet observed between us was, that he was



<P>comparatively seldom at home: a large proportion of his time



<P>appeared devoted to visiting the sick and poor among the scattered



<P>population of his parish.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions:



<P>rain or fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over,



<P>take his hat, and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out



<P>on his mission of love or duty- I scarcely know in which light he



<P>regarded it. Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his



<P>sisters would expostulate. He would then say, with a peculiar smile,



<P>more solemn than cheerful-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn

me



<P>aside from these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be



<P>for the future I propose to myself?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a

sigh, and



<P>some minutes of apparently mournful meditation.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier

to



<P>friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and



<P>even of a brooding nature. Zealous in his ministerial labours,



<P>blameless in his life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy



<P>that mental serenity, that inward content, which should be the



<P>reward of every sincere Christian and practical philanthropist. Often,



<P>of an evening, when he sat at the window, his desk and papers before



<P>him, he would cease reading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and



<P>deliver himself up to I know not what course of thought; but that it



<P>was perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and



<P>changeful dilation of his eye.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury

of



<P>delight it was to his sisters. He expressed once, and but once in my



<P>hearing, a strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an



<P>inborn affection for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home;



<P>but there was more of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in



<P>which the sentiment was manifested; and never did he seem to roam



<P>the moors for the sake of their soothing silence- never seek out or



<P>dwell upon the thousand peaceful delights they could yield.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had

an



<P>opportunity of gauging his mind. I first got an idea of its calibre



<P>when I heard him preach in his own church at Morton. I wish I could



<P>describe that sermon: but it is past my power. I cannot even render



<P>faithfully the effect it produced on me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It began calm- and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch

of voice



<P>went, it was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly



<P>restrained zeal breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted



<P>the nervous language. This grew to force- compressed, condensed,



<P>controlled. The heart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the



<P>power of the preacher: neither were softened. Throughout there was a



<P>strange bitterness; an absence of consolatory gentleness; stern



<P>allusions to Calvinistic doctrines- election, predestination,



<P>reprobation- were frequent; and each reference to these points sounded



<P>like a sentence pronounced for doom. When he had done, instead of



<P>feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by his discourse, I



<P>experienced an expressible sadness; for it seemed to me- I know not



<P>whether equally so to others- that the eloquence to which I had been



<P>listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of



<P>disappointment- where moved troubling impulses of insatiate



<P>yearnings and disquieting aspirations. I was sure St. John Rivers-



<P>pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he was- had not yet found that



<P>peace of God which passeth all understanding; he had no more found it,



<P>I thought, than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my



<P>broken idol and lost elysium- regrets to which I have latterly avoided



<P>referring, but which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime a month was gone. Diana and Mary were soon to

leave Moor



<P>House, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited



<P>them, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city,



<P>where each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty



<P>members they were regarded only as humble dependants, and who



<P>neither knew nor sought out their innate excellences, and



<P>appreciated only their acquired accomplishments as they appreciated



<P>the skill of their cook or the taste of their waiting-woman. Mr. St.



<P>John had said nothing to me yet about the employment he had promised



<P>to obtain for me; yet it became urgent that I should have a vocation



<P>of some kind. One morning, being left alone with him a few minutes



<P>in the parlour, I ventured to approach the window-recess- which his



<P>table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of study- and I was going



<P>to speak, though not very well knowing in what words to frame my



<P>inquiry- for it is at all times difficult to break the ice of



<P>reserve glassing over such natures as his- when he saved me the



<P>trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking up as I drew near- 'You have a question to ask

of me?' he



<P>said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service

I can



<P>offer myself to undertake?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I found or devised something for you three weeks ago;

but as you



<P>seemed both useful and happy here- as my sisters had evidently



<P>become attached to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure-

I



<P>deemed it inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their



<P>approaching departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And they will go in three days now?' I said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage

at



<P>Morton: Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the

subject



<P>first broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of



<P>reflection: his look denoted abstraction from me and my business. I



<P>was obliged to recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of



<P>close and anxious interest to me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers? I

hope this



<P>delay will not have increased the difficulty of securing it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on

me to



<P>give, and you to accept.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.

I grew



<P>impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting



<P>glance fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as



<P>effectually as words could have done, and with less trouble.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You need be in no hurry to hear,' he said: 'let me frankly

tell



<P>you, I have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest. Before I



<P>explain, recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I



<P>helped you, it must be as the blind man would help the lame. I am



<P>poor; for I find that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the



<P>patrimony remaining to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of



<P>scathed firs behind, and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees



<P>and holly-bushes in front. I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but

of



<P>the three sole descendants of the race, two earn the dependant's crust



<P>among strangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his



<P>native country- not only for life, but in death. Yes, and deems, and



<P>is bound to deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after



<P>the day when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid



<P>on his shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose



<P>humblest members he is one, shall give the word, "Rise, follow Me!"'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons,

with a



<P>quiet, deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance



<P>of glance. He resumed-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you

but a



<P>service of poverty and obscurity. You may even think it degrading- for



<P>I see now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your



<P>tastes lean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst



<P>the educated; but I consider that no service degrades which can better



<P>our race. I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the



<P>Christian labourer's task of tillage is appointed him- the scantier



<P>the meed his toil brings- the higher the honour. His, under such



<P>circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers



<P>of the Gospel were the Apostles- their captain was Jesus, the



<P>Redeemer, Himself.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well?' I said, as he again paused- 'proceed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed

leisurely to



<P>read my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a



<P>page. The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially



<P>expressed in his succeeding observations.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe you will accept the post I offer you,' said

he, 'and



<P>hold it for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could



<P>permanently keep the narrow and narrowing- the tranquil, hidden office



<P>of English country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as



<P>detrimental to repose as that in mine, though of a different kind.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do explain,' I urged, when he halted once more.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,-

how trivial-



<P>how cramping. I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is



<P>dead, and that I am my own master. I shall leave the place probably

in



<P>the course of a twelvemonth; but while I do stay, I will exert



<P>myself to the utmost for its improvement. Morton, when I came to it



<P>two years ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded



<P>from every hope of progress. I established one for boys: I mean now

to



<P>open a second school for girls. I have hired a building for the



<P>purpose, with a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress's



<P>house. Her salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already



<P>furnished, very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady,



<P>Miss Oliver; the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish-



<P>Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the



<P>valley. The same lady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan



<P>from the workhouse, on condition that she shall aid the mistress in



<P>such menial offices connected with her own house and the school as her



<P>occupation of teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in



<P>person. Will you be this mistress?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to

expect an



<P>indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not



<P>knowing all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could



<P>not tell in what light the lot would appear to me. In truth it was



<P>humble- but then it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it



<P>was plodding- but then, compared with that of a governess in a rich



<P>house, it was independent; and the fear of servitude with strangers



<P>entered my soul like iron: it was not ignoble- not unworthy- not



<P>mentally degrading. I made my decision.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept

it with all



<P>my heart.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you comprehend me?' he said. 'It is a village school:

your



<P>scholars will be only poor girls- cottagers' children- at the best,



<P>farmers' daughters. Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering,



<P>will be all you will have to teach. What will you do with your



<P>accomplishments? What, with the largest portion of your mind-



<P>sentiments- tastes?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Save them till they are wanted. They will keep.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You know what you undertake, then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one

well



<P>pleased and deeply gratified.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And when will you commence the exercise of your function?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school,

if you like,



<P>next week.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very well: so be it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He rose and walked through the room. Standing still, he

again



<P>looked at me. He shook his head.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?' I asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why? What is your reason for saying so?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which



<P>promises the maintenance of an even tenor in life.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am not ambitious.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He started at the word 'ambitious.' He repeated, 'No. What

made you



<P>think of ambition? Who is ambitious? I know I am: but how did you find



<P>it out?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was speaking of myself.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, if you are not ambitious, you are-' He paused.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would

have



<P>misunderstood the word, and been displeased. I mean, that human



<P>affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you. I am



<P>sure you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude,



<P>and to devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void

of



<P>stimulus: any more than I can be content,' he added, with emphasis,



<P>'to live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains- my nature,



<P>that God gave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed,



<P>paralysed- made useless. You hear now how I contradict myself. I,



<P>who preached contentment with a humble lot, and justified the vocation



<P>even of hewers of wood and drawers of water in God's service- I, His



<P>ordained minister, almost rave in my restlessness. Well,



<P>propensities and principles must be reconciled by some means.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He left the room. In this brief hour I had learnt more

of him



<P>than in the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the

day



<P>approached for leaving their brother and their home. They both tried



<P>to appear as usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was



<P>one that could not be entirely conquered or concealed. Diana intimated



<P>that this would be a different parting from any they had ever yet



<P>known. It would probably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a



<P>parting for years: it might be a parting for life.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves,' she

said:



<P>'natural affection and feelings more potent still. St. John looks



<P>quiet, Jane; but he hides a fever in his vitals. You would think him



<P>gentle, yet in some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst

of



<P>it is, my conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his



<P>severe decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.

It



<P>is right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!' And the tears



<P>gushed to her fine eyes. Mary bent her head low over her work.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We are now without father: we shall soon be without home

and



<P>brother,' she murmured.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed

decreed



<P>by fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that 'misfortunes



<P>never come singly,' and to add to their distresses the vexing one of



<P>the slip between the cup and the lip. St. John passed the window



<P>reading a letter. He entered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Our uncle John is dead,' said he.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled;

the



<P>tidings appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dead?' repeated Diana.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face. 'And

what



<P>then?' she demanded, in a low voice.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What then, Die?' he replied, maintaining a marble immobility

of



<P>feature. 'What then? Why- nothing. Read.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He threw the letter into her lap. She glanced over it,

and handed



<P>it to Mary. Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her



<P>brother. All three looked at each other, and all three smiled- a



<P>dreary, pensive smile enough.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Amen! We can yet live,' said Diana at last.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before,'



<P>remarked Mary.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture

of what



<P>might have been; said Mr. Rivers, 'and contrasts it somewhat too



<P>vividly with what is.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again

went out.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For some minutes no one spoke. Diana then turned to me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries,' she said,

'and



<P>think us hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so



<P>near a relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known



<P>him. He was my mother's brother. My father and he quarrelled long ago.



<P>It was by his advice that my father risked most of his property in the



<P>speculation that ruined him. Mutual recrimination passed between them:



<P>they parted in anger, and were never reconciled. My uncle engaged



<P>afterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a



<P>fortune of twenty thousand pounds. He was never married, and had no



<P>near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely



<P>related than we. My father always cherished the idea that he would



<P>atone for his error by leaving his possessions to us; that letter



<P>informs us that he has bequeathed every penny to the other relation,



<P>with the exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between St.



<P>John, Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning



<P>rings. He had a right, of course, to do as he pleased: and yet a



<P>momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such news.



<P>Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds



<P>each; and to St. John such a sum would have been valuable, for the



<P>good it would have enabled him to do.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no

further



<P>reference made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters. The next day



<P>I left Marsh End for Morton. The day after, Diana and Mary quitted



<P>the parsonage: and so the old grange was abandoned.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; AS I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened,

and



<P>wondered if it were a dream. I could not be certain of the reality



<P>till I had seen Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words



<P>of love and promise.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass,

and felt



<P>it was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its



<P>colour; and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of



<P>fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple. I had often



<P>been unwilling to look at my master, because I feared he could not



<P>be pleased at my look; but I was sure I might lift my face to his now,



<P>and not cool his affection by its expression. I took a plain but clean



<P>and light summer dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no



<P>attire had ever so well become me, because none had I ever worn in



<P>so blissful a mood.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to

see that a



<P>brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night;



<P>and to feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and



<P>fragrant breeze. Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy. A



<P>beggar-woman and her little boy- pale, ragged objects both- were



<P>coming up the walk, and I ran down and gave them all the money I



<P>happened to have in my purse- some three or four shillings: good or



<P>bad, they must partake of my jubilee. The rooks cawed, and blither



<P>birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing



<P>heart.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window

with a sad



<P>countenance, and saying gravely- 'Miss Eyre, will you come to



<P>breakfast?' During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not



<P>undeceive her then. I must wait for my master to give explanations;



<P>and so must she. I ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs. I



<P>met Adele leaving the schoolroom.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where are you going? It is time for lessons.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where is he?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In there,' pointing to the apartment she had left; and

I went



<P>in, and there he stood.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come and bid me good-morning,' said he. I gladly advanced;

and



<P>it was not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that



<P>I received, but an embrace and a kiss. It seemed natural: it seemed



<P>genial to be so well loved, so caressed by him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty,' said

he: 'truly



<P>pretty this morning. Is this my pale, little elf? Is this my



<P>mustard-seed? This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek



<P>and rosy lips; the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel



<P>eyes?' (I had green eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for



<P>him they were new-dyed, I suppose.)



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is Jane Eyre, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Soon to be Jane Rochester,' he added: 'in four weeks,

Janet; not a



<P>day more. Do you hear that?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me

giddy. The



<P>feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than



<P>was consistent with joy- something that smote and stunned: it was, I



<P>think, almost fear.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that

for?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because you gave me a new name- Jane Rochester; and it

seems so



<P>strange.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Mrs. Rochester,' said he; 'young Mrs. Rochester-

Fairfax



<P>Rochester's girl-bride.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely. Human

beings never



<P>enjoy complete happiness in this world. I was not born for a different



<P>destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling



<P>me is a fairy tale- a day-dream.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Which I can and will realise. I shall begin to-day. This

morning I



<P>wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his



<P>keeping,- heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield. In a day or two I



<P>hope to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every



<P>attention shall be yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if



<P>about to marry her.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, sir!- never mind jewels! I don't like to hear them

spoken



<P>of. Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would



<P>rather not have them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and

the



<P>circlet on your forehead,- which it will become: for nature, at least,



<P>has stamped her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will



<P>clasp the bracelets on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like



<P>fingers with rings.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other

things,



<P>and in another strain. Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am



<P>your plain, Quakerish governess.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the

desire of



<P>my heart,- delicate and aerial.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Puny and insignificant, you mean. You are dreaming, sir,-

or you



<P>are sneering. For God's sake, don't be ironical!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too,'

he went



<P>on, while I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because



<P>I felt he was either deluding himself or trying to delude me. 'I



<P>will attire my Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her



<P>hair; and I will cover the head I love best with a priceless veil.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your

Jane Eyre



<P>any longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket- a jay in borrowed



<P>plumes. I would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in



<P>stage-trappings, as myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't



<P>call you handsome, sir, though I love you most dearly: far too



<P>dearly to flatter you. Don't flatter me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.



<P>'This very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you



<P>must choose some dresses for yourself. I told you we shall be



<P>married in four weeks. The wedding is to take place quietly, in the



<P>church down below yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to



<P>town. After a brief stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions



<P>nearer the sun: to French vineyards and Italian plains; and she



<P>shall see whatever is famous in old story and in modern record: she



<P>shall taste, too, of the life of cities; and she shall learn to



<P>value herself by just comparison with others.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shall I travel?- and with you, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence,

Venice,



<P>and Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden

by



<P>you: wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.



<P>Ten years since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate,



<P>and rage as my companions: now I shall revisit it healed and



<P>cleaned, with a very angel as my comforter.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I laughed at him as he said this. 'I am not an angel,'

I



<P>asserted; 'and I will not be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr.



<P>Rochester, you must neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me-



<P>for you will not get it, any more than I shall get it of you: which



<P>I do not at all anticipate.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do you anticipate of me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,-

a very



<P>little while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be



<P>capricious; and then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to



<P>please you: but when you get well used to me, you will perhaps like

me



<P>again,- like me, I say, not love me. I suppose your love will



<P>effervesce in six months, or less. I have observed in books written

by



<P>men, that period assigned as the farthest to which a husband's



<P>ardour extends. Yet, after all, as a friend and companion, I hope



<P>never to become quite distasteful to my dear master.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Distasteful! and like you again! I think I shall like

you again,



<P>and yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only like, but



<P>love you- with truth, fervour, constancy.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet are you not capricious, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very

devil



<P>when I find out they have neither souls nor hearts- when they open



<P>to me a perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility,



<P>coarseness, and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent



<P>tongue, to the soul made of fire, and the character that bends but



<P>does not break- at once supple and stable, tractable and consistent-

I



<P>am ever tender and true.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Had you ever experience of such a character, sir? Did

you ever



<P>love such an one?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I love it now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to

your



<P>difficult standard?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I never met your likeness. Jane, you please me, and you

master me-



<P>you seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and



<P>while I am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends



<P>a thrill up my arm to my heart. I am influenced- conquered; and the



<P>influence is sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo



<P>has a witchery beyond any triumph I can win. Why do you smile, Jane?



<P>What does that inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was



<P>involuntary), I was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their



<P>charmers-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You were, you little elfish-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hush, sir! You don't talk very wisely just now; any more

than



<P>those gentlemen acted very wisely. However, had they been married,



<P>they would no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for



<P>their softness as suitors; and so will you, I fear. I wonder how you



<P>will answer me a year hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit



<P>your convenience or pleasure to grant.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ask me something now, Janet- the least thing: I desire

to be



<P>entreated-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed I will sir; I have my petition all ready.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Speak! But if you look up and smile with that countenance,

I shall



<P>swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of



<P>me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels,

and



<P>don't crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace



<P>round that plain pocket-handkerchief you have there.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I might as well "gild refined gold." I know it: your request

is



<P>granted then- for the time. I will remand the order I despatched to

my



<P>banker. But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a



<P>gift to be withdrawn: try again.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity,



<P>which is much piqued on one point.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked disturbed. 'What? what?' he said hastily. 'Curiosity

is a



<P>dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord



<P>every request-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry

into,



<P>perhaps, a secret, it was a wish for half my estate.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, King Ahasuerus! What do I want with half your estate?

Do



<P>you think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land? I



<P>would much rather have all your confidence. You will not exclude me



<P>from your confidence if you admit me to your heart?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having,

Jane;



<P>but for God's sake, don't desire a useless burden! Don't long for



<P>poison- don't turn out a downright Eve on my hands!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why not, sir? You have just been telling me how much you

liked



<P>to be conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you. Don't you



<P>think I had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and



<P>coax and entreat- even cry and be sulky if necessary- for the sake



<P>of a mere essay of my power?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I dare you to any such experiment. Encroach, presume,

and the game



<P>is up.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it, sir? You soon give in. How stern you look now!

Your



<P>eyebrows have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead



<P>resembles what, in some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled,

"a



<P>blue-piled thunderloft." That will be your married look, sir, I



<P>suppose?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If that will be your married look, I, as a Christian,

will soon



<P>give up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander. But



<P>what had you to ask, thing,- out with it?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness

a great



<P>deal better than flattery. I had rather be a thing than an angel. This



<P>is what I have to ask,- Why did you take such pains to make me believe



<P>you wished to marry Miss Ingram?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is that all? Thank God it is no worse!' And now he unknit

his



<P>black brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if



<P>well pleased at seeing a danger averted. 'I think I may confess,' he



<P>continued, 'even although I should make you a little indignant,



<P>Jane- and I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are



<P>indignant. You glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you



<P>mutinied against fate, and claimed your rank as my equal. Janet, by



<P>the bye, it was you who made me the offer.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course I did. But to the point if you please, sir-

Miss



<P>Ingram?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished

to



<P>render you as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew



<P>jealousy would be the best ally I could call in for the furtherance

of



<P>that end.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Excellent! Now you are small- not one whit bigger than

the end



<P>of my little finger. It was a burning shame and a scandalous



<P>disgrace to act in that way. Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's



<P>feelings, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Her feelings are concentrated in one- pride; and that

needs



<P>humbling. Were you jealous, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting

to you to



<P>know that. Answer me truly once more. Do you think Miss Ingram will



<P>not suffer from your dishonest coquetry? Won't she feel forsaken and



<P>deserted?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Impossible!- when I told you how she, on the contrary,

deserted



<P>me: the idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her



<P>flame in a moment.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester. I am

afraid



<P>your principles on some points are eccentric.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have

grown a



<P>little awry for want of attention.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that

has been



<P>vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the



<P>bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That you may, my good little girl: there is not another

being in



<P>the world has the same pure love for me as yourself- for I lay that



<P>pleasant unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder. I

loved him



<P>very much- more than I could trust myself to say- more than words



<P>had power to express.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ask something more,' he said presently; 'it is my delight

to be



<P>entreated, and to yield.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was again ready with my request. 'Communicate your intentions



<P>to Mrs. Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall,



<P>and she was shocked. Give her some explanation before I see her again.



<P>It pains me to be misjudged by so good a woman.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go to your room, and put on your bonnet,' he replied.

'I mean



<P>you to accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare



<P>for the drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding. Did



<P>she think, Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered



<P>it well lost?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and

yours, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Station! station!- your station is in my heart, and on

the necks



<P>of those who would insult you, now or hereafter.- Go.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit

Mrs.



<P>Fairfax's parlour, I hurried down to it. The old lady had been reading



<P>her morning portion of Scripture- the Lesson for the day; her Bible



<P>lay open before her, and her spectacles were upon it. Her



<P>occupation, suspended by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now



<P>forgotten: her eyes, fixed on the blank wall opposite, expressed the



<P>surprise of a quiet mind stirred by unwonted tidings. Seeing me, she



<P>roused herself: she made a sort of effort to smile, and framed a few



<P>words of congratulation; but the smile expired, and the sentence was



<P>abandoned unfinished. She put up her spectacles, shut the Bible, and



<P>pushed her chair back from the table.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I feel so astonished,' she began, 'I hardly know what

to say to



<P>you, Miss Eyre. I have surely not been dreaming, have I? Sometimes I



<P>half fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have



<P>never happened. It has seemed to me more than once when I have been

in



<P>a doze, that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come



<P>in and sat down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by



<P>my name, Alice, as he used to do. Now, can you tell me whether it is



<P>actually true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him? Don't



<P>laugh at me. But I really thought he came in here five minutes ago,



<P>and said that in a month you would be his wife.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He has said the same thing to me,' I replied.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He has! Do you believe him? Have you accepted him?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at me bewildered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I could never have thought it. He is a proud man: all

the



<P>Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked money. He, too,



<P>has always been called careful. He means to marry you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He tells me so.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they

had



<P>there found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It passes me!' she continued; 'but no doubt it is true

since you



<P>say so. How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.



<P>Equality of position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and



<P>there are twenty years of difference in your ages. He might almost



<P>be your father.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!' exclaimed I, nettled; 'he is

nothing



<P>like my father! No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an



<P>instant. Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men

at



<P>five-and-twenty.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it really for love he is going to marry you?' she asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the

tears rose



<P>to my eyes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am sorry to grieve you,' pursued the widow; 'but you

are so



<P>young, and so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on



<P>your guard. It is an old saying that "all is not gold that



<P>glitters"; and in this case I do fear there will be something found

to



<P>be different to what either you or I expect.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why?- am I a monster?' I said: 'is it impossible that

Mr.



<P>Rochester should have a sincere affection for me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and

Mr.



<P>Rochester, I daresay, is fond of you. I have always noticed that you



<P>were a sort of pet of his. There are times when, for your sake, I have



<P>been a little uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to



<P>put you on your guard: but I did not like to suggest even the



<P>possibility of wrong. I knew such an idea would shock, perhaps



<P>offend you; and you were so discreet, and so thoroughly modest and



<P>sensible, I hoped you might be trusted to protect yourself. Last night



<P>I cannot tell you what I suffered when I sought all over the house,



<P>and could find you nowhere, nor the master either; and then, at twelve



<P>o'clock, saw you come in with him.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, never mind that now,' I interrupted impatiently;

'it is



<P>enough that all was right.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hope all will be right in the end,' she said: 'but believe

me,



<P>you cannot be too careful. Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:



<P>distrust yourself as well as him. Gentlemen in his station are not



<P>accustomed to marry their governesses.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let me go,- let me go to Millcote too!' she cried. 'Mr.



<P>Rochester won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage. Beg



<P>him to let me go, mademoiselle.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That I will, Adele'; and I hastened away with her, glad

to quit my



<P>gloomy monitress. The carriage was ready: they were bringing it



<P>round to the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot



<P>following him backwards and forwards.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I told her no. I'll have no brats!- I'll have only you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would

be better.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not it: she will be a restraint.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice. The chill

of



<P>Mrs. Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me:



<P>something of unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes. I



<P>half lost the sense of power over him. I was about mechanically to



<P>obey him, without further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the



<P>carriage, he looked at my face.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is the matter?' he asked; 'all the sunshine is gone.

Do you



<P>really wish the bairn to go? Will it annoy you if she is left behind?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would far rather she went, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!'



<P>cried he to Adele.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She obeyed him with what speed she might.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter



<P>much,' said he, 'when I mean shortly to claim you- your thoughts,



<P>conversation, and company- for life.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of

expressing



<P>her gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away



<P>into a corner on the other side of him. She then peeped round to where



<P>I sat; so stern a neighbour was too restrictive; to him, in his



<P>present fractious mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask



<P>of him any information.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let her come to me,' I entreated: 'she will, perhaps,

trouble you,



<P>sir: there is plenty of room on this side.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog. 'I'll send

her to



<P>school yet,' he said, but now he was smiling.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school 'sans



<P>mademoiselle?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' he replied, 'absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I

am to



<P>take mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one

of



<P>the white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall



<P>live with me there, and only me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her,' observed



<P>Adele.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains

and



<P>hillsides in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a

fire?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold,

I'll



<P>carry her up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, qu'elle y sera mal- peu comfortable! And her clothes,

they



<P>will wear out: how can she get new ones?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled. 'Hem!' said he.

'What



<P>would you do, Adele? Cudgel your brains for an expedient. How would



<P>a white or a pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think? And one could



<P>cut a pretty enough scarf out of a rainbow.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is far better as she is,' concluded Adele, after musing

some



<P>time: 'besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the



<P>moon. If I were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She has consented: she has pledged her word.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon:

it is



<P>all air; and neither you nor she can fly.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Adele, look at that field.' We were now outside Thornfield



<P>gates, and bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where



<P>the dust was well laid by the thunderstorm, and where the low hedges



<P>and lofty timber trees on each side glistened green and



<P>rain-refreshed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about

a



<P>fortnight since- the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in



<P>the orchard meadows; and as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down



<P>to rest me on a stile; and there I took out a little book and a



<P>pencil, and began to write about a misfortune that befell me long ago,



<P>and a wish I had for happy days to come: I was writing away very fast,



<P>though daylight was fading from the leaf, when something came up the



<P>path and stopped two yards off me. I looked at it. It was a little



<P>thing with a veil of gossamer on its head. I beckoned it to come



<P>near me; it stood soon at my knee. I never spoke to it, and it never



<P>spoke to me, in words; but I read its eyes, and it read mine; and



<P>our speechless colloquy was to this effect-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its

errand



<P>was to make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a



<P>lonely place- such as the moon, for instance- and it nodded its head



<P>towards her horn, rising over Hayhill: it told me of the alabaster



<P>cave and silver vale where we might live. I said I should like to



<P>go; but reminded it, as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"Oh," returned the fairy, "that does not signify! Here

is a



<P>talisman will remove all difficulties"; and she held out a pretty gold



<P>ring. "Put it," she said, "on the fourth finger of my left hand, and

I



<P>am yours, and you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own



<P>heaven yonder." She nodded again at the moon. The ring, Adele, is in



<P>my breeches-pocket, under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon



<P>to change it to a ring again.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But what has mademoiselle to do with it? I don't care

for the



<P>fairy: you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mademoiselle is a fairy,' he said, whispering mysteriously.



<P>Whereupon I told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part,



<P>evinced a fund of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr.



<P>Rochester 'un vrai menteur,' and assuring him that she made no account



<P>whatever of his 'contes de fee,' and that 'du reste, il n'y avait



<P>pas de fees, et quand meme il y en avait': she was sure they would



<P>never appear to him, nor ever give him rings, or offer to live with



<P>him in the moon.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one

to me.



<P>Mr. Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I



<P>was ordered to choose half a dozen dresses. I hated the business, I



<P>begged leave to defer it: no- it should be gone through with now. By



<P>dint of entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the



<P>half-dozen to two: these, however, he vowed he would select himself.



<P>With anxiety I watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on

a



<P>rich silk of the most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.



<P>I told him in a new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me

a



<P>gold gown and a silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never



<P>venture to wear his choice. With infinite difficulty, for he was



<P>stubborn as a stone, I persuaded him to make an exchange in favour



<P>of a sober black satin and pearl-grey silk. 'It might pass for the



<P>present,' he said; 'but he would yet see me glittering like a



<P>parterre.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then

out of



<P>a jeweller's shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned



<P>with a sense of annoyance and degradation. As we re-entered the



<P>carriage, and I sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in



<P>the hurry of events, dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten- the



<P>letter of my uncle, John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt

me



<P>and make me his legatee. 'It would, indeed, be a relief,' I thought,



<P>'if I had ever so small an independency; I never can bear being



<P>dressed like a doll by Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae



<P>with the golden shower falling daily round me. I will write to Madeira



<P>the moment I get home, and tell my uncle John I am going to be



<P>married, and to whom: if I had but a prospect of one day bringing



<P>Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I could better endure to be



<P>kept by him now.' And somewhat relieved by this idea (which I failed



<P>not to execute that day), I ventured once more to meet my master's and



<P>lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought mine, though I averted



<P>both face and gaze. He smiled; and I thought his smile was such as a



<P>sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave his



<P>gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was ever hunting



<P>mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the passionate



<P>pressure.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You need not look in that way,' I said; 'if you do, I'll

wear



<P>nothing but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter. I'll be



<P>married in this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for



<P>yourself out of the pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of



<P>waistcoats out of the black satin.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He chuckled; he rubbed his hands. 'Oh, it is rich to see

and hear



<P>her!' he exclaimed. 'Is she original? Is she piquant? I would not



<P>exchange this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole



<P>seraglio, gazelle-eyes, houri forms, and all!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Eastern allusion bit me again. 'I'll not stand you

an inch in



<P>the stead of a seraglio,' I said; 'so don't consider me an



<P>equivalent for one. If you have a fancy for anything in that line,



<P>away with you, sir, to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and



<P>lay out in extensive slave-purchases some of that spare cash you



<P>seem at a loss to spend satisfactorily here.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for

so many



<P>tons of flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to

preach



<P>liberty to them that are enslaved- your harem inmates amongst the



<P>rest. I'll get admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you,



<P>three-tailed bashaw as you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself



<P>fettered amongst our hands: nor will I, for one, consent to cut your



<P>bonds till you have signed a charter, the most liberal that despot



<P>ever yet conferred.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated

for it



<P>with an eye like that. While you looked so, I should be certain that



<P>whatever charter you might grant under coercion, your first act,



<P>when released, would be to violate its conditions.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, Jane, what would you have? I fear you will compel

me to go



<P>through a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the



<P>altar. You will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms- what will they



<P>be?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded

obligations.



<P>Do you remember what you said of Celine Varens?- of the diamonds,



<P>the cashmeres you gave her? I will not be your English Celine



<P>Varens. I shall continue to act as Adele's governess; by that I



<P>shall earn my board and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.



<P>I'll furnish my own wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give



<P>me nothing but-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, but what?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt

will be



<P>quit.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride,

you haven't



<P>your equal,' said he. We were now approaching Thornfield. 'Will it



<P>please you to dine with me to-day?' he asked, as we re-entered the



<P>gates.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, thank you, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what for, "no, thank you?" if one may inquire.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason

why I should



<P>now: till-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Till what? You delight in half-phrases.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Till I can't help it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you

dread being



<P>the companion of my repast?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but

I want to go



<P>on as usual for another month.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will give up your governessing slavery at once.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not. I shall

just go



<P>on with it as usual. I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have



<P>been accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you



<P>feel disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort

me under all



<P>this, "pour me donner une contenance," as Adele would say; and



<P>unfortunately I have neither my cigar-case nor my snuff-box. But



<P>listen- whisper. It is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be



<P>mine presently; and when once I have fairly seized you, to have and

to



<P>hold, I'll just- figuratively speaking- attach you to a chain like



<P>this' (touching his watch-guard). 'Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you



<P>in my bosom, lest my jewel I should tyne.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage,

and while



<P>he afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good



<P>my retreat upstairs.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening. I had



<P>prepared an occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend



<P>the whole time in a tete-a-tete conversation. I remembered his fine



<P>voice; I knew he liked to sing- good singers generally do. I was no



<P>vocalist myself, and, in his fastidious judgment, no musician, either;



<P>but I delighted in listening when the performance was good. No



<P>sooner had twilight, that hour of romance, began to lower her blue and



<P>starry banner over the lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and



<P>entreated him, for the love of heaven, to give me a song. He said I



<P>was a capricious witch, and that he would rather sing another time;



<P>but I averred that no time was like the present.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did I like his voice?' he asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very much.' I was not fond of pampering that susceptible

vanity of



<P>his; but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe



<P>and stimulate it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very well, sir, I will try.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated

'a



<P>little bungler.' Being pushed unceremoniously to one side- which was



<P>precisely what I wished- he usurped my place, and proceeded to



<P>accompany himself: for he could play as well as sing. I hied me to the



<P>window-recess. And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees



<P>and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following



<P>strain:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

'The truest love that ever heart



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Felt at its kindled core,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Did through each vein, in quickened start,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The tide of being pour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Her coming was my hope each day,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Her parting was my pain;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The chance that did her steps delay



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Was ice in every vein.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As I loved, loved to be;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And to this object did I press



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As blind as eagerly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But wide as pathless was the space



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

That lay our lives between,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And dangerous as the foamy race



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Of ocean-surges green.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And haunted as a robber-path



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Through wilderness or wood;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Between our spirits stood.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I omens did defy:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I passed impetuous by.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

On sped my rainbow, fast as light;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I flew as in a dream;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For glorious rose upon my sight



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

That child of Shower and Gleam.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Still bright on clouds of suffering dim



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Shines that soft, solemn joy;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Nor care I now, how dense and grim



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Disasters gather nigh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I care not in this moment sweet,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Though all I have rushed o'er



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Proclaiming vengeance sore:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Though haughty Hate should strike me down,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Right, bar approach to me,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And grinding Might, with furious frown,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Swear endless enmity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

My love has placed her little hand



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

With noble faith in mine,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And vowed that wedlock's sacred band



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Our nature shall entwine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

With me to live- to die;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I have at last my nameless bliss:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As I love- loved am I!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled,

and



<P>his full falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every



<P>lineament. I quailed momentarily- then I rallied. Soft scene, daring



<P>demonstration, I would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a



<P>weapon of defence must be prepared- I whetted my tongue: as he reached



<P>me, I asked with asperity, 'whom he was going to marry now?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed! I considered it a very natural and necessary one:

he had



<P>talked of his future wife dying with him. What did he mean by such a



<P>pagan idea? I had no intention of dying with him- he might depend on



<P>that.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might

live with



<P>him! Death was not for such as I.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time

came as



<P>he had: but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a



<P>suttee.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my

pardon by a



<P>reconciling kiss?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No: I would rather be excused.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I heard myself apostrophised as a 'hard little thing';

and



<P>it was added, 'any other woman would have been melted to marrow at



<P>hearing such stanzas crooned in her praise.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I assured him I was naturally hard- very flinty, and that

he



<P>would often find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show



<P>him divers rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks



<P>elapsed: he should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made,



<P>while there was yet time to rescind it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would I be quiet and talk rationally?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally,

I



<P>flattered myself I was doing that now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He fretted, pished, and pshawed. 'Very good,' I thought;

'you may



<P>fume and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue



<P>with you, I am certain. I like you more than I can say; but I'll not



<P>sink into a bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll



<P>keep you from the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its



<P>pungent aid that distance between you and myself most conducive to our



<P>real mutual advantage.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation;



<P>then, after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of



<P>the room, I got up, and saying, 'I wish you good-night, sir,' in my



<P>natural and wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door



<P>and got away.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole

season of



<P>probation; and with the best success. He was kept, to be sure,



<P>rather cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was



<P>excellently entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and



<P>turtle-dove sensibility, while fostering his despotism more, would



<P>have pleased his judgment, satisfied his common sense, and even suited



<P>his taste less.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential

and



<P>quiet; any other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in



<P>the evening conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him. He



<P>continued to send for me punctually the moment the clock struck seven;



<P>though when I appeared before him now, he had no such honeyed terms

as



<P>'love' and 'darling' on his lips: the best words at my service were



<P>'provoking puppet,' 'malicious elf,' 'sprite,' 'changeling,' etc.



<P>For caresses, too, I now got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a



<P>pinch on the arm; for a kiss on the cheek, a severe tweak of the



<P>ear. It was all right: at present I decidedly preferred these fierce



<P>favours to anything more tender. Mrs. Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her



<P>anxiety on my account vanished; therefore I was certain I did well.



<P>Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I was wearing him to skin and bone,



<P>and threatened awful vengeance for my present conduct at some period



<P>fast coming. I laughed in my sleeve at his menaces. 'I can keep you

in



<P>reasonable check now,' I reflected; 'and I don't doubt to be able to



<P>do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its virtue, another must be



<P>devised.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would

rather



<P>have pleased than teased him. My future husband was becoming to me



<P>my whole world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.



<P>He stood between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse



<P>intervenes between man and the broad sun. I could not, in those



<P>days, see God for His creature: of whom I had made an idol.

CHAPTER VIII</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; ERE the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was

dismissed,



<P>and all were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to



<P>descend: it was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the



<P>floor. The spell by which I had been so far supported began to



<P>dissolve; reaction took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief



<P>that seized me, I sank prostrate with my face to the ground. Now I



<P>wept: Helen Burns was not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself

I



<P>abandoned myself, and my tears watered the boards. I had meant to be



<P>so good, and to do so much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn



<P>respect and win affection. Already I had made visible progress; that



<P>very morning I had reached the head of my class; Miss Miller had



<P>praised me warmly; Miss Temple had smiled approbation; she had



<P>promised to teach me drawing, and to let me learn French, if I



<P>continued to make similar improvement two months longer: and then I



<P>was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an equal by those

of



<P>my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay again crushed and



<P>trodden on; and could I ever rise more?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never,' I thought; and ardently I wished to die. While

sobbing out



<P>this wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up-



<P>again Helen Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming



<P>up the long, vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come, eat something,' she said; but I put both away from

me,



<P>feeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present



<P>condition. Helen regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not



<P>now abate my agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep



<P>aloud. She sat down on the ground near me, embraced her knees with her



<P>arms, and rested her head upon them; in that attitude she remained



<P>silent as an Indian. I was the first who spoke-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes

to be a



<P>liar?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Everybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who

have



<P>heard you called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But what have I to do with millions? The eighty, I know,

despise



<P>me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school

either



<P>despises or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great

and



<P>admired man; he is little liked here; he never took steps to make



<P>himself liked. Had he treated you as an especial favourite, you



<P>would have found enemies, declared or covert, all around you; as it



<P>is, the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared.



<P>Teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two, but



<P>friendly feelings are concealed in their hearts; and if you



<P>persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long appear so much



<P>the more evidently for their temporary suppression. Besides, Jane'-



<P>she paused.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, Helen?' said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed

my



<P>fingers gently to warm them, and went on-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while

your



<P>own conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would



<P>not be without friends.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is

not



<P>enough: if others don't love me I would rather die than live- I cannot



<P>bear to be solitary and hated, Helen. Look here; to gain some real



<P>affection from you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love,



<P>I would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to



<P>let a bull toss me, or to stand behind a kicking horse, and let it



<P>dash its hoof at my chest-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings;

you



<P>are too impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created



<P>your frame, and put life into it, has provided you with other



<P>resources than your feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you.



<P>Besides this earth, and besides the race of men, there is an invisible



<P>world and a kingdom of spirits: that world is round us, for it is



<P>everywhere; and those spirits watch us, for they are commissioned to



<P>guard us; and if we were dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us

on



<P>all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see our tortures, recognise



<P>our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you are of this charge



<P>which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at secondhand



<P>from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and

on



<P>your clear front), and God waits only the separation of spirit from



<P>flesh to crown us with a full reward. Why, then, should we ever sink



<P>overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon over, and death is



<P>so certain an entrance to happiness- to glory?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity

she



<P>imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the



<P>impression of woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came;



<P>and when, having done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed



<P>a short cough, I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague



<P>concern for her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round

her waist;



<P>she drew me to her, and we reposed in silence. We had not sat long



<P>thus, when another person came in. Some heavy clouds, swept from the



<P>sky by a rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming



<P>in through a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching



<P>figure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,' said she; 'I

want you



<P>in my room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had

to



<P>thread some intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we



<P>reached her apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked



<P>cheerful. Miss Temple told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair



<P>on one side of the hearth, and herself taking another, she called me



<P>to her side.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it all over?' she asked, looking down at my face. 'Have

you



<P>cried your grief away?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am afraid I never shall do that.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and

everybody



<P>else, will now think me wicked.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.



<P>Continue to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shall I, Miss Temple?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will,' said she, passing her arm round me. 'And now

tell me



<P>who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife. My uncle is dead, and he left

me to



<P>her care.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle,

as I have



<P>often heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that



<P>she would always keep me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you,

that when a



<P>criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.



<P>You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well

as



<P>you can. Say whatever your memory suggests as true; but add nothing



<P>and exaggerate nothing.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most



<P>moderate- most correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order



<P>to arrange coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of



<P>my sad childhood. Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued



<P>than it generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful

of



<P>Helen's warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused



<P>into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary. Thus



<P>restrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I



<P>went on that Miss Temple fully believed me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as

having



<P>come to see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful



<P>episode of the red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure,



<P>in some degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my



<P>recollection the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed



<P>spurned my wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time



<P>in the dark and haunted chamber.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in

silence;



<P>she then said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if

his



<P>reply agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from



<P>every imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where

I was well



<P>contented to stand for I derived a child's pleasure from the



<P>contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her



<P>white forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark



<P>eyes), she proceeded to address Helen Burns.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How are you to-night, Helen? Have you coughed much to-day?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not quite so much, I think, ma'am.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And the pain in your chest?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a little better.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse;

then



<P>she returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.



<P>She was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said



<P>cheerfully-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you

as such.'



<P>She rang her bell.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Barbara,' she said to the servant who answered it, 'I

have not yet



<P>had tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And a tray was soon brought. How pretty, to my eyes, did

the



<P>china cups and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table



<P>near the fire! How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the



<P>scent of the toast! of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was



<P>beginning to be hungry), discerned only a very small portion: Miss



<P>Temple discerned it too.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Barbara,' said she, 'can you not bring a little more bread

and



<P>butter? There is not enough for three.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Barbara went out: she returned soon-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman

after Mr.



<P>Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and



<P>iron.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, very well!' returned Miss Temple; 'we must make it

do,



<P>Barbara, I suppose.' And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling,



<P>'Fortunately, I have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this



<P>once.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and

placed



<P>before each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of



<P>toast, she got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel



<P>wrapped in paper, disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized



<P>seed-cake.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I meant to give each of you some of this to take with

you,' said



<P>she, 'but as there is so little toast, you must have it now,' and



<P>she proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and

not the



<P>least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with



<P>which our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished



<P>appetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to

the fire;



<P>we sat one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed



<P>between her and Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be



<P>admitted to hear.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air,

of state



<P>in her mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded



<P>deviation into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which



<P>chastened the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her,



<P>by a controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as



<P>to Helen Burns, I was struck with wonder.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and



<P>kindness of her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all



<P>these, something in her own unique mind, had roused her powers



<P>within her. They woke, they kindled: first, they glowed in the



<P>bright tint of her cheek, which till this hour I had never seen but



<P>pale and bloodless; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her



<P>eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that



<P>of Miss Temple's- a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash,



<P>nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of radiance. Then her



<P>soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what source I cannot



<P>tell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough,

to



<P>hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence? Such was the



<P>characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to me, memorable evening;



<P>her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much



<P>as many live during a protracted existence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations

and times



<P>past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or



<P>guessed at: they spoke of books: how many they had read! What stores



<P>of knowledge they possessed! Then they seemed so familiar with



<P>French names and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax



<P>when Miss Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to



<P>recall the Latin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a



<P>shelf, bade her read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen



<P>obeyed, my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line. She



<P>had scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could



<P>be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us both, saying, as she drew us to



<P>her heart-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'God bless you, my children!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go

more



<P>reluctantly; it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her



<P>she a second time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from



<P>her cheek.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd:



<P>she was examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's,



<P>and when we entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told



<P>that to-morrow she should have half a dozen of untidily folded



<P>articles pinned to her shoulder.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My things were indeed in shameful disorder,' murmured

Helen to me,



<P>in a low voice: 'I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters

on a



<P>piece of pasteboard the word 'Slattern,' and bound it like a



<P>phylactery round Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and



<P>benign-looking forehead. She wore it till evening, patient,



<P>unresentful, regarding it as a deserved punishment. The moment Miss



<P>Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I ran to Helen, tore it



<P>off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which she was



<P>incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and



<P>large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of



<P>her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated,

Miss



<P>Temple, who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared



<P>that what he said went to corroborate my account. Miss Temple,



<P>having assembled the whole school, announced that inquiry had been



<P>made into the charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most



<P>happy to be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every



<P>imputation. The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and

a



<P>murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set

to work



<P>afresh, resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I



<P>toiled hard, and my success was proportionate to my efforts; my



<P>memory, not naturally tenacious, improved with practice; exercise



<P>sharpened my wits; in a few weeks I was promoted to a higher class;

in



<P>less than two months I was allowed to commence French and drawing. I



<P>learned the first two tenses of the verb Etre, and sketched my first



<P>cottage (whose walls, by the bye, outrivalled in slope those of the



<P>leaning tower of Pisa), on the same day. That night, on going to



<P>bed, I forgot to prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot



<P>roast potatoes, or white bread and new milk, with which I was wont



<P>to amuse my inward cravings: I feasted instead on the spectacle of



<P>ideal drawings, which I saw in the dark; all the work of my own hands:



<P>freely pencilled houses and trees, picturesque rocks and ruins,



<P>Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings of butterflies hovering



<P>over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe cherries, of wrens' nests



<P>enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with young ivy sprays. I



<P>examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my ever being able to



<P>translate currently a certain little French story which Madame Pierrot



<P>had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved to my



<P>satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well has Solomon said- 'Better is a dinner of herbs where

love



<P>is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations

for



<P>Gateshead and its daily luxuries.

CHAPTER XX</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I HAD forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did,

and also



<P>to let down my window-blind. The consequence was, that when the



<P>moon, which was full and bright (for the night was fine), came in



<P>her course to that space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked



<P>in at me through the unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.



<P>Awaking in the dead of night, I opened my eyes on her disk-



<P>silver-white and crystal clear. It was beautiful, but too solemn: I



<P>half rose, and stretched my arm to draw the curtain.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Good God! What a cry!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The night- its silence- its rest, was rent in twain by

a savage,



<P>a sharp, a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm

was



<P>paralysed. The cry died, and was not renewed. Indeed, whatever being



<P>uttered that fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the



<P>widest-winged condor on the Andes could, twice in succession, send out



<P>such a yell from the cloud shrouding his eyrie. The thing delivering



<P>such utterance must rest ere it could repeat the effort.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.

And



<P>overhead- yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling- I now



<P>heard a struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a



<P>half-smothered voice shouted-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Help! help! help!' three times rapidly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will no one come?' it cried; and then, while the staggering

and



<P>stamping went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Rochester! Rochester! for God's sake, come!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the



<P>gallery. Another step stamped on the flooring above and something



<P>fell; and there was silence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs;

I



<P>issued from my apartment. The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,



<P>terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one



<P>looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled. Gentlemen and



<P>ladies alike had quitted their beds; and 'Oh! what is it?'- 'Who is



<P>hurt?'- 'What has happened?'- 'Fetch a light!'- 'Is it fire?'- 'Are



<P>there robbers?'- 'Where shall we run?' was demanded confusedly on



<P>all hands. But for the moon-light they would have been in complete



<P>darkness. They ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed,



<P>some stumbled: the confusion was inextricable.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where the devil is Rochester?' cried Colonel Dent. 'I

cannot



<P>find him in his bed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Here! here!' was shouted in return. 'Be composed, all

of you:



<P>I'm coming.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr.

Rochester



<P>advanced with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.



<P>One of the ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss



<P>Ingram.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What awful event has taken place?' said she. 'Speak! let

us know



<P>the worst at once!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But don't pull me down or strangle me,' he replied: for

the Misses



<P>Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast



<P>white wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All's right!- all's right!' he cried. 'It's a mere rehearsal

of



<P>Much Ado about Nothing. Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.

Calming



<P>himself by an effort, he added-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A servant has had the nightmare; that is all. She's an



<P>excitable, nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition,



<P>or something of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with



<P>fright. Now, then, I must see you all back into your rooms; for,



<P>till the house is settled, she cannot be looked after. Gentlemen, have



<P>the goodness to set the ladies the example. Miss Ingram, I am sure you



<P>will not fail in evincing superiority to idle terrors. Amy and Louisa,



<P>return to your nests like a pair of doves, as you are. Mesdames' (to



<P>the dowagers), 'you will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay

in



<P>this chill gallery any longer.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he

contrived



<P>to get them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories. I



<P>did not wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as



<P>unnoticed I had left it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and

dressed



<P>myself carefully. The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the



<P>words that had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for



<P>they had proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me



<P>that it was not a servant's dream which had thus struck horror through



<P>the house; and that the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely



<P>an invention framed to pacify his guests. I dressed, then, to be ready



<P>for emergencies. When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking



<P>out over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew



<P>not what. It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry,



<P>struggle, and call.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased



<P>gradually, and in about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed

as



<P>a desert. It seemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire.



<P>Meantime the moon declined: she was about to set. Not liking to sit

in



<P>the cold and darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed



<P>as I was. I left the window, and moved with little noise across the



<P>carpet; as I stooped to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped



<P>low at the door.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Am I wanted?' I asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you up?' asked the voice I expected to hear, viz.,

my



<P>master's.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And dressed?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come out, then, quietly.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I obeyed. Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a

light.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I want you,' he said: 'come this way: take your time,

and make



<P>no noise.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as

softly as a



<P>cat. He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the



<P>dark, low corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and



<P>stood at his side.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you a sponge in your room?' he asked in a whisper.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you any salts- volatile salts?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go back and fetch both.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts

in my



<P>drawer, and once more retraced my steps. He still waited; he held a



<P>key in his hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put



<P>it in the lock; he paused, and addressed me again.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness,

and no



<P>faintness.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just give me your hand,' he said: 'it will not do to risk

a



<P>fainting fit.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I put my fingers into his. 'Warm and steady,' was his remark:

he



<P>turned the key and opened the door.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day

Mrs. Fairfax



<P>showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the



<P>tapestry was now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent,



<P>which had then been concealed. This door was open; a light shone out



<P>of the room within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost



<P>like a dog quarrelling. Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said



<P>to me, 'Wait a minute,' and he went forward to the inner apartment.



<P>A shout of laughter greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and



<P>terminating in Grace Poole's own goblin ha! ha! She then was there.

He



<P>made some sort of arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low



<P>voice address him: he came out and closed the door behind him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Here, Jane!' he said; and I walked round to the other

side of a



<P>large bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable



<P>portion of the chamber. An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat



<P>in it, dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his



<P>head leant back; his eyes were closed. Mr. Rochester held the candle



<P>over him; I recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face- the



<P>stranger, Mason: I saw too that his linen on one side and one arm, was



<P>almost soaked in blood.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hold the candle,' said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he

fetched



<P>a basin of water from the washstand: 'Hold that,' said he. I obeyed.



<P>He took the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like



<P>face; he asked for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.



<P>Mr. Mason shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned. Mr. Rochester



<P>opened the shirt of the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were



<P>bandaged: he sponged away blood, trickling fast down.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is there immediate danger?' murmured Mr. Mason.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pooh! No- a mere scratch. Don't be so overcome, man: bear

up! I'll



<P>fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by



<P>morning, I hope. Jane,' he continued.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman,

for an



<P>hour, or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when



<P>it returns: if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that



<P>stand to his lips, and your salts to his nose. You will not speak to



<P>him on any pretext- and- Richard, it will be at the peril of your life



<P>if you speak to her: open your lips- agitate yourself- and I'll not



<P>answer for the consequences.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not

move;



<P>fear, either of death or of something else, appeared almost to



<P>paralyse him. Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand,



<P>and I proceeded to use it as he had done. He watched me a second, then



<P>saying, 'Remember!- No conversation,' he left the room. I



<P>experienced a strange feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the



<P>sound of his retreating step ceased to be heard.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one

of its



<P>mystic cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my



<P>eyes and hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door:



<P>yes- that was appalling- the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the



<P>thought of Grace Poole bursting out upon me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I must keep to my post, however. I must watch this ghastly



<P>countenance- these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose- these eyes



<P>now shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on



<P>me, and ever glazed with the dulness of horror. I must dip my hand



<P>again and again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the



<P>trickling gore. I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on



<P>my employment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry



<P>round me, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and



<P>quiver strangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite- whose



<P>front, divided into twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads



<P>of the twelve apostles, each enclosed in its separate panel as in a



<P>frame; while above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying



<P>Christ.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam

hovered



<P>here or glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that



<P>bent his brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the



<P>devilish face of Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed



<P>gathering life and threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor- of



<P>Satan himself- in his subordinate's form.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen

for



<P>the movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den. But



<P>since Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I



<P>heard but three sounds at three long intervals,- a step creak, a



<P>momentary renewal of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human



<P>groan.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then my own thoughts worried me. What crime was this, that

lived



<P>incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled



<P>nor subdued by the owner?- what mystery, that broke out now in fire



<P>and now in blood, at the deadest hours of night? What creature was it,



<P>that, masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice,



<P>now of a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And this man I bent over- this commonplace, quiet stranger-

how had



<P>he become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown

at



<P>him? What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely



<P>season, when he should have been asleep in bed? I had heard Mr.



<P>Rochester assign him an apartment below- what brought him here? And



<P>why, now, was he so tame under the violence or treachery done him? Why



<P>did he so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?



<P>Why did Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment? His guest had been



<P>outraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted



<P>against; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in



<P>oblivion! Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester;



<P>that the impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the



<P>inertness of the former: the few words which had passed between them



<P>assured me of this. It was evident that in their former intercourse,



<P>the passive disposition of the one had been habitually influenced by



<P>the active energy of the other: whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester's



<P>dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival? Why had the mere name



<P>of this unresisting individual- whom his word now sufficed to



<P>control like a child- fallen on him, a few hours since, as a



<P>thunderbolt might fall on an oak?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh! I could not forget his look and his paleness when he

whispered:



<P>'Jane, I have got a blow- I have got a blow, Jane.' I could not forget



<P>how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was

no



<P>light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the



<P>vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When will he come? When will he come?' I cried inwardly,

as the



<P>night lingered and lingered- as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned,



<P>sickened: and neither day nor aid arrived. I had, again and again,



<P>held the water to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him



<P>the stimulating salts: my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily

or



<P>mental suffering, or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast



<P>prostrating his strength. He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild,



<P>and lost, I feared he was dying; and I might not even speak to him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I

perceived



<P>streaks of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then



<P>approaching. Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his



<P>distant kennel in the courtyard: hope revived. Nor was it unwarranted:



<P>in five minutes more the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me



<P>my watch was relieved. It could not have lasted more than two hours:



<P>many a week has seemed shorter.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had

been to



<P>fetch.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, Carter, be on the alert,' he said to this last: 'I

give you



<P>but half an hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages,



<P>getting the patient downstairs and all.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But is he fit to move, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous,

his



<P>spirits must be kept up. Come, set to work.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the

holland



<P>blind, let in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and



<P>cheered to see how far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were



<P>beginning to brighten the east. Then he approached Mason, whom the



<P>surgeon was already handling.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, my good fellow, how are you?' he asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She's done for me, I fear,' was the faint reply.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not a whit!- courage! This day fortnight you'll hardly

be a pin



<P>the worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all. Carter,



<P>assure him there's no danger.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I can do that conscientiously,' said Carter, who had now

undone



<P>the bandages; 'only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would



<P>not have bled so much- but how is this? The flesh on the shoulder is



<P>torn as well as cut. This wound was not done with a knife: there



<P>have been teeth here!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She bit me,' he murmured. 'She worried me like a tigress,

when



<P>Rochester got the knife from her.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You should not have yielded: you should have grappled

with her



<P>at once,' said Mr. Rochester.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But under such circumstances, what could one do?' returned



<P>Mason. 'Oh, it was frightful!' he added, shuddering. 'And I did not



<P>expect it: she looked so quiet at first.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I warned you,' was his friend's answer; 'I said- be on

your



<P>guard when you go near her. Besides, you might have waited till



<P>to-morrow, and had me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the



<P>interview to-night, and alone.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I thought I could have done some good.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You thought! you thought! Yes, it makes me impatient to

hear



<P>you: but, however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer



<P>enough for not taking my advice; so I'll say no more. Carter-



<P>hurry!- hurry! The sun will soon rise, and I must have him off.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged. I must look

to



<P>this other wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart,'

said Mason.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression

of



<P>disgust, horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to



<P>distortion, but he only said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish:

don't



<P>repeat it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wish I could forget it,' was the answer.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will when you are out of the country: when you get

back to



<P>Spanish Town, you may think of her as dead and buried- or rather,



<P>you need not think of her at all.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Impossible to forget this night!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is not impossible: have some energy, man. You thought

you



<P>were as dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and



<P>talking now. There!- Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll



<P>make you decent in a trice. Jane' (he turned to me for the first



<P>time since his re-entrance), 'take this key: go down into my



<P>bedroom, and walk straight forward into my dressing-room: open the top



<P>drawer of the wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and



<P>neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the



<P>articles named, and returned with them.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now,' said he, 'go to the other side of the bed while

I order



<P>his toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I retired as directed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?'

inquired Mr.



<P>Rochester presently.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir; all was very still.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better,

both



<P>for your sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder. I have



<P>striven long to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at



<P>last. Here, Carter, help him on with his waistcoat. Where did you



<P>leave your furred cloak? You can't travel a mile without that, I know,



<P>in this damned cold climate. In your room?- Jane, run down to Mr.



<P>Mason's room,- the one next mine,- and fetch a cloak you will see



<P>there.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle

lined



<P>and edged with fur.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, I've another errand for you,' said my untiring master;

you



<P>must away to my room again. What a mercy you are shod with velvet,



<P>Jane!- a clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture. You



<P>must open the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little



<P>phial and a little glass you will find there,- quick!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That's well! Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of



<P>administering a dose myself, on my own responsibility. I got this



<P>cordial at Rome, of an Italian charlatan- a fellow you would have



<P>kicked, Carter. It is not a thing to be used indiscriminately, but



<P>it is good upon occasion: as now, for instance. Jane, a little water.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He held out the tiny glass, and I half-filled it from the



<P>water-bottle on the washstand.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That will do;- now wet the lip of the phial.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid,

and



<P>presented it to Mason.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for

an hour



<P>or so.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But will it hurt me?- is it inflammatory?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Drink! drink! drink!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.

He



<P>was dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and



<P>sullied. Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had



<P>swallowed the liquid; he then took his arm-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now I am sure you can get on your feet,' he said- 'try.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The patient rose.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Carter, take him under the other shoulder. Be of good

cheer,



<P>Richard; step out- that's it!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do feel better,' remarked Mr. Mason.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am sure you do. Now, Jane, trip on before us away to

the



<P>backstairs; unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the



<P>post-chaise you will see in the yard- or just outside, for I told



<P>him not to drive his rattling wheels over the pavement- to be ready;



<P>we are coming: and, Jane, if any one is about, come to the foot of the



<P>stairs and hem.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on

the point of



<P>rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent. The



<P>side-passage door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as



<P>possible: all the yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and



<P>there was a post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver



<P>seated on the box, stationed outside. I approached him, and said the



<P>gentlemen were coming; he nodded: then I looked carefully round and



<P>listened. The stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the



<P>curtains were yet drawn over the servants' chamber windows; little



<P>birds were just twittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees,



<P>whose boughs drooped like white garlands over the wall enclosing one



<P>side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped from time to time in



<P>their closed stables: all else was still.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The gentlemen now appeared. Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester

and



<P>the surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him



<P>into the chaise; Carter followed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take care of him,' said Mr. Rochester to the latter, 'and

keep him



<P>at your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two



<P>to see how he gets on. Richard, how is it with you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The fresh air revives me, Fairfax.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no

wind-



<P>good-bye, Dick.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fairfax-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, what is it?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly

as may



<P>be: let her- ' he stopped and burst into tears.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do my best; and have done it, and will do it,' was the

answer:



<P>he shut up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet would to God there was an end of all this!' added

Mr.



<P>Rochester, as he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards

a



<P>door in the wall bordering the orchard. I, supposing he had done



<P>with me, prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard



<P>him call 'Jane!' He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for



<P>me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments,'

he said;



<P>'that house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,' he answered;



<P>'and you see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that



<P>the gilding is slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble



<P>is sordid slate, and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly



<P>bark. Now here' (he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered)



<P>'all is real, sweet, and pure.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees,

pear



<P>trees, and cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full

of



<P>all sorts of old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses,



<P>pansies, mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various



<P>fragrant herbs. They were fresh now as a succession of April showers



<P>and gleams, followed by a lovely spring morning, could make them:



<P>the sun was just entering the dappled east, and his light illumined



<P>the wreathed and dewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks



<P>under them.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, will you have a flower?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and

offered



<P>it to me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you like this sunrise, Jane? That sky with its high

and light



<P>clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm- this



<P>placid and balmy atmosphere?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do, very much.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have passed a strange night, Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And it has made you look pale- were you afraid when I

left you



<P>alone with Mason?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I had fastened the door- I had the key in my pocket:

I



<P>should have been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb- my pet



<P>lamb- so near a wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her- put the thing

out of



<P>your thoughts.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she

stays.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never fear- I will take care of myself.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now,

sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England:

nor even



<P>then. To live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may



<P>crack and spue fire any day.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led. Your influence,

sir, is



<P>evidently potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or



<P>wilfully injure you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh no! Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he

hurt me-



<P>but, unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word,



<P>deprive me, if not of life, yet for ever of happiness.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear,

and show



<P>him how to avert the danger.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily

threw



<P>it from him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger

be?



<P>Annihilated in a moment. Ever since I have known Mason, I have only



<P>had to say to him "Do that," and the thing has been done. But I cannot



<P>give him orders in this case: I cannot say "Beware of harming me,



<P>Richard"; for it is imperative that I should keep him ignorant that



<P>harm to me is possible. Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you



<P>further. You are my little friend, are you not?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that

is right.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Precisely: I see you do. I see genuine contentment in

your gait



<P>and mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing



<P>me- working for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say,



<P>"all that is right": for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there



<P>would be no light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively



<P>glance and animated complexion. My friend would then turn to me, quiet



<P>and pale, and would say, "No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it,



<P>because it is wrong"; and would become immutable as a fixed star.



<P>Well, you too have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not



<P>show you where I am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you



<P>are, you should transfix me at once.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have

from



<P>me, sir, you are very safe.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'God grant it may be so! Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit

down.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it

contained



<P>a rustic seat. Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me:



<P>but I stood before him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sit,' he said; 'the bench is long enough for two. You

don't



<P>hesitate to take a place at my side, do you? Is that wrong, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt,

have been



<P>unwise.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew- while

all the



<P>flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their



<P>young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do



<P>their first spell of work- I'll put a case to you, which you must



<P>endeavour to suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me



<P>you are at ease, and not fearing that I err in detaining you, or



<P>that you err in staying.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir; I am content.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:- suppose you

were no



<P>longer a girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged



<P>from childhood upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land;



<P>conceive that you there commit a capital error, no matter of what



<P>nature or from what motives, but one whose consequences must follow



<P>you through life and taint all your existence. Mind, I don't say a



<P>crime; I am not speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act,



<P>which might make the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is



<P>error. The results of what you have done become in time to you utterly



<P>insupportable; you take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures,



<P>but neither unlawful nor culpable. Still you are miserable; for hope



<P>has quitted you on the very confines of life: your sun at noon darkens



<P>in an eclipse, which you feel will not leave it till the time of



<P>setting. Bitter and base associations have become the sole food of



<P>your memory: you wander here and there, seeking rest in exile:



<P>happiness in pleasure- I mean in heartless, sensual pleasure- such



<P>as dulls intellect and blights feeling. Heart-weary and soul-withered,



<P>you come home after years of voluntary banishment: you make a new



<P>acquaintance- how or where no matter: you find in this stranger much



<P>of the good and bright qualities which you have sought for twenty



<P>years, and never before encountered; and they are all fresh,



<P>healthy, without soil and without taint. Such society revives,



<P>regenerates: you feel better days come back-higher wishes, purer



<P>feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what



<P>remains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being. To



<P>attain this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of



<P>custom-a mere conventional impediment which neither your conscience



<P>sanctifies nor your judgment approves?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused for an answer: and what was I to say? Oh, for

some good



<P>spirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response! Vain



<P>aspiration! The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle



<P>Ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the



<P>tree-tops; but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and

repentant,



<P>man justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him



<P>for ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing



<P>his own peace of mind and regeneration of life?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir,' I answered, 'a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation



<P>should never depend on a fellow-creature. Men and women die;



<P>philosophers falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any



<P>one you know has suffered and erred, let him look higher than his



<P>equals for strength to amend and solace to heal.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But the instrument- the instrument! God, who does the

work,



<P>ordains the instrument. I have myself- I tell it you without



<P>parable- been a worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I



<P>have found the instrument for my cure in-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly



<P>rustling. I almost wondered they did not check their songs and



<P>whispers to catch the suspended revelation; but they would have had

to



<P>wait many minutes- so long was the silence protracted. At last I



<P>looked up at the tardy speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Little friend,' said he, in quite a changed tone- while

his face



<P>changed too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh



<P>and sarcastic- 'you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram:



<P>don't you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a



<P>vengeance?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the

walk, and



<P>when he came back he was humming a tune.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, Jane,' said he, stopping before me, 'you are quite

pale with



<P>your vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Curse you? No, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shake hands in confirmation of the word. What cold fingers!

They



<P>were warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the



<P>mysterious chamber. Jane, when will you watch with me again?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whenever I can be useful, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For instance, the night before I am married! I am sure

I shall not



<P>be able to sleep. Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me



<P>company? To you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her



<P>and know her.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A strapper- a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom;

with



<P>hair just such as the ladies of Carthage must have had. Bless me!



<P>there's Dent and Lynn in the stables! Go in by the shrubbery,



<P>through that wicket.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in

the yard,



<P>saying cheerfully-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone

before



<P>sunrise: I rose at four to see him off.'

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; IT was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the

season of



<P>general holiday approached. I now closed Morton school, taking care



<P>that the parting should not be barren on my side. Good fortune opens



<P>the hand as well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when



<P>we have largely received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual



<P>ebullition of the sensations. I had long felt with pleasure that



<P>many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that



<P>consciousness was confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly



<P>and strongly. Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place



<P>in their unsophisticated hearts: I promised them that never a week



<P>should pass in future that I did not visit them, and give them an



<P>hour's teaching in their school.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering

sixty



<P>girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key



<P>in my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some



<P>half-dozen of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and



<P>well-informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the



<P>British peasantry. And that is saying a great deal; for after all, the



<P>British peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most



<P>self-respecting of any in Europe: since those days I have seen



<P>paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them seemed to me



<P>ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton girls.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you consider you have got your reward for a season

of



<P>exertion?' asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone. 'Does not the



<P>consciousness of having done some real good in your day and generation



<P>give pleasure?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Doubtless.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you have only toiled a few months! Would not a life

devoted to



<P>the task of regenerating your race be well spent?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' I said; 'but I could not go on for ever so: I want

to



<P>enjoy my own faculties as well as to cultivate those of other



<P>people. I must enjoy them now; don't recall either my mind or body



<P>to the school; I am out of it and disposed for full holiday.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked grave. 'What now? What sudden eagerness is this

you



<P>evince? What are you going to do?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To be active: as active as I can. And first I must beg

you to



<P>set Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you want her?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, to go with me to Moor House. Diana and Mary will

be at home



<P>in a week, and I want to have everything in order against their



<P>arrival.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I understand. I thought you were for flying off on some

excursion.



<P>It is better so: Hannah shall go with you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the

schoolroom



<P>key: I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He took it. 'You give it up very gleefully,' said he; 'I

don't



<P>quite understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what



<P>employment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are



<P>relinquishing. What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have



<P>you now?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My first aim will be to clean down (do you comprehend

the full



<P>force of the expression?)- to clean down Moor House from chamber to



<P>cellar; my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite



<P>number of cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every



<P>chair, table, bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I



<P>shall go near to ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in



<P>every room; and lastly, the two days preceding that on which your



<P>sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a



<P>beating of eggs, sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding



<P>of Christmas cakes, chopping up of materials for mince-pies, and



<P>solemnising of other culinary rites, as words can convey but an



<P>inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you. My purpose, in



<P>short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect state of



<P>readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my ambition



<P>is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is all very well for the present,' said he; 'but seriously,

I



<P>trust that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a



<P>little higher than domestic endearments and household joys.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I mean, on the contrary, to be busy.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace

I allow



<P>you for the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing



<P>yourself with this late-found charm of relationship; but then, I



<P>hope you will begin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly



<P>society, and the selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised



<P>affluence. I hope your energies will then once more trouble you with



<P>their strength.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked at him with surprise. 'St. John,' I said, 'I think

you are



<P>almost wicked to talk so. I am disposed to be as content as a queen,



<P>and you try to stir me up to restlessness! To what end?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To the end of turning to profit the talents which God

has



<P>committed to your keeping; and of which He will surely one day



<P>demand a strict account. Jane, I shall watch you closely and



<P>anxiously- I warn you of that. And try to restrain the



<P>disproportionate fervour with which you throw yourself into



<P>commonplace home pleasures. Don't cling so tenaciously to ties of



<P>the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an adequate cause;



<P>forbear to waste them on trite transient objects. Do you hear, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek. I feel I have

adequate



<P>cause to be happy, and I will be happy. Good-bye!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did

Hannah:



<P>she was charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a



<P>house turned topsy-turvy- how I could brush, and dust, and clean,



<P>and cook. And really, after a day or two of confusion worse



<P>confounded, it was delightful by degrees to invoke order from the



<P>to purchase some new furniture: my cousins having given me carte



<P>blanche to effect what alterations I pleased, and a sum having been



<P>set aside for that purpose. The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I



<P>left much as they were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more



<P>pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables, and chairs, and



<P>beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest innovations. Still



<P>some novelty was necessary, to give to their return the piquancy



<P>with which I wished it to be invested. Dark handsome new carpets and



<P>curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique



<P>ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and



<P>dressing-cases, for the toilet-tables, answered the end: they looked



<P>fresh without being glaring. A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished



<P>entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on



<P>the passage, and carpets on the stairs. When all was finished, I



<P>thought Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness



<P>within, as it was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and



<P>desert dreariness without.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The eventful Thursday at length came. They were expected

about



<P>dark, and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen



<P>was in perfect trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in



<P>readiness.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. John arrived first. I had entreated him to keep quite

clear



<P>of the house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare



<P>idea of the commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its



<P>walls sufficed to scare him to estrangement. He found me in the



<P>kitchen, watching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then



<P>baking. Approaching the hearth, he asked, 'If I was at last



<P>satisfied with housemaid's work?' I answered by inviting him to



<P>accompany me on a general inspection of the result of my labours. With



<P>some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the house. He just



<P>looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered upstairs and



<P>downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of fatigue



<P>and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so short a



<P>time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the



<P>improved aspect of his abode.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This silence damped me. I thought perhaps the alterations

had



<P>disturbed some old associations he valued. I inquired whether this was



<P>the case: no doubt in a somewhat crestfallen tone.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had



<P>scrupulously respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must



<P>have bestowed more thought on the matter than it was worth. How many



<P>minutes, for instance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of



<P>this very room?- By the bye, could I tell him where such a book was?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down,

and



<P>withdrawing to his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I did not like this, reader. St. John was a good man;

but I



<P>began to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was



<P>hard and cold. The humanities and amenities of life had no



<P>attraction for him- its peaceful enjoyments no charm. Literally, he



<P>lived only to aspire- after what was good and great, certainly; but



<P>still he would never rest, nor approve of others resting round him.

As



<P>I looked at his lofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone- at



<P>his fine lineaments fixed in study- I comprehended all at once that

he



<P>would hardly make a good husband: that it would be a trying thing to



<P>be his wife. I understood, as by inspiration, the nature of his love



<P>for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him that it was but a love of the



<P>senses. I comprehended how he should despise himself for the



<P>feverish influence it exercised over him; how he should wish to stifle



<P>and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever conducing



<P>permanently to his happiness or hers. I saw he was of the material



<P>from which nature hews her heroes- Christian and Pagan- her lawgivers,



<P>her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great interests



<P>to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous



<P>column, gloomy and out of place.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This parlour is not his sphere,' I reflected: 'the Himalayan

ridge



<P>or Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit



<P>him better. Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not



<P>his element: there his faculties stagnate- they cannot develop or



<P>appear to advantage. It is in scenes of strife and danger- where



<P>courage is proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked- that

he



<P>will speak and move, the leader and superior. A merry child would have



<P>the advantage of him on this hearth. He is right to choose a



<P>missionary's career- I see it now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They are coming! they are coming!' cried Hannah, throwing

open the



<P>parlour door. At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully. Out I ran.



<P>It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible. Hannah soon had



<P>a lantern lit. The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver



<P>opened the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.



<P>In a minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with



<P>Mary's soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls. They laughed-



<P>kissed me- then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with



<P>delight; asked eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the



<P>affirmative, hastened into the house.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from

Whitcross,



<P>and chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances



<P>expanded to the cheerful firelight. While the driver and Hannah



<P>brought in the boxes, they demanded St. John. At this moment he



<P>advanced from the parlour. They both threw their arms round his neck



<P>at once. He gave each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words



<P>of welcome, stood a while to be talked to, and then, intimating that



<P>he supposed they would soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew



<P>there as to a place of refuge.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first

to give



<P>hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed



<P>me. They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their



<P>rooms; with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted



<P>china vases: they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly. I had



<P>the pleasure of feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly,



<P>and that what I had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return



<P>home.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet was that evening. My cousins, full of exhilaration,

were so



<P>eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St.



<P>John's taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in



<P>their glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise. The



<P>event of the day- that is, the return of Diana and Mary- pleased



<P>him; but the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the



<P>garrulous glee of reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer



<P>morrow was come. In the very meridian of the night's enjoyment,



<P>about an hour after tea, a rap was heard at the door. Hannah entered



<P>with the intimation that 'a poor lad was come, at that unlikely



<P>time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his mother, who was drawing away.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where does she live, Hannah?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and

moor and



<P>moss all the way.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell him I will go.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'm sure, sir, you had better not. It's the worst road

to travel



<P>after dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog. And then



<P>it is such a bitter night- the keenest wind you ever felt. You had



<P>better send word, sir, that you will be there in the morning.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak;

and



<P>without one objection, one murmur, he departed. It was then nine



<P>o'clock: he did not return till midnight. Starved and tired enough



<P>he was: but he looked happier than when he set out. He had performed



<P>an act of duty; made an exertion; felt his own strength to do and



<P>deny, and was on better terms with himself.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.

It



<P>was Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it



<P>in a sort of merry domestic dissipation. The air of the moors, the



<P>freedom of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's



<P>spirits like some life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning



<P>till noon, and from noon till night. They could always talk; and their



<P>discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I



<P>preferred listening to, and sharing in it, to doing anything else. St.



<P>John did not rebuke our vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was



<P>seldom in the house; his parish was large, the population scattered,



<P>and he found daily business in visiting the sick and poor in its



<P>different districts.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little

pensive for



<P>some minutes, asked him, 'If his plans were yet unchanged.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Unchanged and unchangeable,' was the reply. And he proceeded

to



<P>inform us that his departure from England was now definitely fixed for



<P>the ensuing year.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And Rosamond Oliver?' suggested Mary, the words seeming

to



<P>escape her lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them,



<P>than she made a gesture as if wishing to recall them. St. John had a



<P>book in his hand- it was his unsocial custom to read at meals- he



<P>closed it, and looked up.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Rosamond Oliver,' said he, 'is about to be married to

Mr.



<P>Granby, one of the best connected and most estimable residents in



<P>from her father yesterday.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three

looked



<P>at him: he was serene as glass.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The match must have been got up hastily,' said Diana:

'they cannot



<P>have known each other long.'



<P>But where there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case,



<P>where the connection is in every point desirable, delays are



<P>Frederic gives up to them, can be refitted for their reception.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time I found St. John alone after this communication,

I



<P>felt tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed



<P>so little to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him



<P>more, I experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had



<P>already hazarded. Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him:



<P>his reserve was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed



<P>beneath it. He had not kept his promise of treating me like his



<P>sisters; he continually made little, chilling differences between



<P>us, which did not at all tend to the development of cordiality: in



<P>short, now that I was acknowledged his kinswoman, and lived under



<P>the same roof with him, I felt the distance between us to be far



<P>greater than when he had known me only as the village



<P>schoolmistress. When I remembered how far I had once been admitted



<P>to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present frigidity.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when

he raised



<P>his head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately

reply:



<P>after a moment's hesitation I answered-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But are you sure you are not in the position of those

conquerors



<P>whose triumphs have cost them too dear? Would not such another ruin



<P>you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify;

I shall



<P>never be called upon to contend for such another. The event of the



<P>conflict is decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!' So



<P>saying, he returned to his papers and his silence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As our mutual happiness (i.e., Diana's, Mary's, and mine)

settled



<P>into a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and



<P>regular studies, St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the



<P>same room, sometimes for hours together. While Mary drew, Diana



<P>pursued a course of encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and



<P>amazement) undertaken, and I fagged away at German, he pondered a



<P>mystic lore of his own: that of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition



<P>of which he thought necessary to his plans.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet

and



<P>absorbed enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the



<P>outlandish-looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing



<P>upon us, his fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation:



<P>if caught, it would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it



<P>returned searchingly to our table. I wondered what it meant: I



<P>wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit



<P>on an occasion that seemed to me of small moment, namely, my weekly



<P>visit to Morton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the



<P>day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and



<P>his sisters urged me not to go, he would invariably make light of



<P>their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish the task without



<P>regard to the elements.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her,' he

would



<P>say: 'she can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of



<P>snow, as well as any of us. Her constitution is both sound and



<P>elastic;- better calculated to endure variations of climate than



<P>many more robust.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not

a



<P>little weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to



<P>murmur would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him;



<P>the reverse was a special annoyance.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because

I



<P>really had a cold. His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I



<P>sat reading Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.

As



<P>I exchanged a translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way:



<P>there I found myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue



<P>eye. How long it had been searching me through and through, and over



<P>and over, I cannot tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for



<P>the moment superstitious- as if I were sitting in the room with



<P>something uncanny.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, what are you doing?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Learning German.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are not in earnest?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell

you why.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language

he was



<P>himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to



<P>forget the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a



<P>pupil with whom he might again and again go over the elements, and



<P>so fix them thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for



<P>some time between me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me



<P>because he saw I could sit at a task the longest of the three. Would

I



<P>do him this favour? I should not, perhaps, have to make the



<P>sacrifice long, as it wanted now barely three months to his departure.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt

that every



<P>impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved



<P>and permanent. I consented. When Diana and Mary returned, the former



<P>found her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed,



<P>and both she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded



<P>them to such a step. He answered quietly-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I know it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an

exacting



<P>master: he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his



<P>expectations, he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.



<P>By degrees, he acquired a certain influence over me that took away



<P>my liberty of mind: his praise and notice were more restraining than



<P>his indifference. I could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was



<P>by, because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that



<P>vivacity (at least in me) was distasteful to him. I was so fully aware



<P>that only serious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his



<P>presence every effort to sustain or follow any other became vain: I



<P>fell under a freezing spell. When he said 'go,' I went; 'come,' I



<P>came; 'do this,' I did it. But I did not love my servitude: I



<P>wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round

him,



<P>bidding him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom;



<P>and, as was equally his custom, he gave me his hand. Diana, who



<P>chanced to be in a frolicsome humour (she was not painfully controlled



<P>by his will; for hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but

you don't



<P>treat her as such: you should kiss her too.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She pushed me towards him. I thought Diana very provoking,

and felt



<P>uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.



<P>John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine,



<P>his eyes questioned my eyes piercingly- he kissed me. There are no



<P>such things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my



<P>ecclesiastical cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but



<P>there may be experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss. When



<P>given, he viewed me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am



<P>sure I did not blush; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for

I



<P>felt as if this kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters. He never



<P>omitted the ceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with



<P>which I underwent it, seemed to invest it for him with a certain



<P>charm.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do

so, I



<P>felt daily more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle



<P>half my faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force



<P>myself to the adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural



<P>vocation. He wanted to train me to an elevation I could never reach;



<P>it racked me hourly to aspire to the standard he uplifted. The thing



<P>was as impossible as to mould my irregular features to his correct and



<P>classic pattern, to give to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint



<P>and solemn lustre of his own.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at

present. Of



<P>late it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil



<P>sat in my heart and drained my happiness at its source- the evil of



<P>suspense.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader,

amidst



<P>these changes of place and fortune. Not for a moment. His idea was



<P>still with me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse,



<P>nor a sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name



<P>graven on a tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it



<P>inscribed. The craving to know what had become of him followed me



<P>everywhere; when I was at Morton, I re-entered my cottage every



<P>evening to think of that; and now at Moor House, I sought my bedroom



<P>each night to brood over it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs



<P>about the will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr.



<P>Rochester's present residence and state of health; but, as St. John



<P>had conjectured, he was quite ignorant of all concerning him. I then



<P>wrote to Mrs. Fairfax, entreating information on the subject. I had



<P>calculated with certainty on this step answering my end: I felt sure



<P>it would elicit an early answer. I was astonished when a fortnight



<P>passed without reply; but when two months wore away, and day after day



<P>the post arrived and brought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the



<P>keenest anxiety.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having

missed.



<P>Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for



<P>some weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word



<P>reached me. When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died



<P>out, and then I felt dark indeed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.

Summer



<P>approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished



<P>to accompany me to the sea-side. This St. John opposed; he said I



<P>did not want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too



<P>purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying



<P>deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee,



<P>and grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like



<P>a fool, never thought of resisting him- I could not resist him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than

usual; the



<P>ebb was occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment. Hannah had



<P>told me in the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down



<P>to take it, almost certain that the long-looked-for tidings were



<P>vouchsafed me at last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr.



<P>Briggs on business. The bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and



<P>now, as I sat poring over the crabbed characters and flourishing



<P>tropes of an Indian scribe, my eyes filled again.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to

do this my



<P>voice failed me: words were lost in sobs. He and I were the only



<P>occupants of the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the



<P>drawing-room, Mary was gardening- it was a very fine May day, clear,



<P>sunny, and breezy. My companion expressed no surprise at this emotion,



<P>nor did he question me as to its cause; he only said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.'

And



<P>while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and



<P>patient, leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching



<P>with the eye of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a



<P>patient's malady. Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and



<P>muttered something about not being very well that morning, I resumed



<P>my task, and succeeded in completing it. St. John put away my books



<P>and his, locked his desk, and said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will call Diana and Mary.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must

be



<P>you. Put on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road



<P>towards the head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium

in my



<P>dealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own,



<P>between absolute submission and determined revolt. I have always



<P>faithfully observed the one, up to the very moment of bursting,



<P>sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither



<P>present circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to



<P>mutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John's directions; and



<P>in ten minutes I was treading the wild track of the glen, side by side



<P>with him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet

with



<P>scents of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream



<P>descending the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along



<P>plentiful and clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire



<P>tints from the firmament. As we advanced and left the track, we trod

a



<P>soft turf, mossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a



<P>tiny white flower, and spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the



<P>hills, meantime, shut us quite in; for the glen, towards its head,



<P>wound to their very core.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let us rest here,' said St. John, as we reached the first



<P>stragglers of a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond



<P>which the beck rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little



<P>farther, the mountain shook off turf and flower, had only heath for



<P>raiment and crag for gem- where it exaggerated the wild to the savage,



<P>and exchanged the fresh for the frowning- where it guarded the forlorn



<P>hope of solitude, and a last refuge for silence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I took a seat: St. John stood near me. He looked up the

pass and



<P>down the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and



<P>returned to traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he



<P>removed his hat, let the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow. He



<P>seemed in communion with the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade



<P>farewell to something.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And I shall see it again,' he said aloud, 'in dreams when

I



<P>sleep by the Ganges: and again in a more remote hour- when another



<P>slumber overcomes me- on the shore of a darker stream!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange words of a strange love! An austere patriot's passion

for



<P>his fatherland! He sat down; for half an hour we never spoke;



<P>neither he to me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East

Indiaman



<P>which sails on the 20th of June.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work,'

I



<P>answered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' said he, 'there is my glory and joy. I am the servant

of



<P>an infallible Master. I am not going out under human guidance, subject



<P>to the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms:

my



<P>king, my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect. It seems strange

to



<P>me that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,-



<P>to join in the same enterprise.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All have not Your powers, and it would be folly for the

feeble



<P>to wish to march with the strong.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address

only



<P>such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Those are few in number, and difficult to discover.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them

up- to



<P>urge and exhort them to the effort- to show them what their gifts are,



<P>and why they were given- to speak Heaven's message in their ear,- to



<P>offer them, direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If they are really qualified for the task, will not their

own



<P>hearts be the first to inform them of it?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering

over



<P>me: I trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once



<P>declare and rivet the spell.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what does your heart say?' demanded St. John.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My heart is mute- my heart is mute,' I answered, struck

and



<P>thrilled.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then I must speak for it,' continued the deep, relentless

voice.



<P>'Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and



<P>fellow-labourer.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved! It was as

if I had



<P>heard a summons from Heaven- as if a visionary messenger, like him



<P>of Macedonia, had enounced, 'Come over and help us!' But I was no



<P>apostle,- I could not behold the herald,- I could not receive his



<P>call.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, St. John!' I cried, 'have some mercy!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed

his



<P>duty, knew neither mercy nor remorse. He continued-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife. It

is not



<P>personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed



<P>for labour, not for love. A missionary's wife you must- shall be.



<P>You shall be mine: I claim you- not for my pleasure, but for my



<P>Sovereign's service.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am not fit for it: I have no vocation,' I said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He had calculated on these first objections: he was not

irritated



<P>by them. Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded



<P>his arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was



<P>prepared for a long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock

of



<P>patience to last him to its close- resolved, however, that that



<P>close should be conquest for him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Humility, Jane,' said he, 'is the groundwork of Christian

virtues:



<P>you say right that you are not fit for the work. Who is fit for it?

Or



<P>who, that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the



<P>summons? I, for instance, am but dust and ashes. With St. Paul, I



<P>acknowledge myself the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this



<P>sense of my personal vileness to daunt me. I know my Leader: that He



<P>is just as well as mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument



<P>to perform a great task, He will, from the boundless stores of His



<P>providence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end. Think



<P>like me, Jane- trust like me. It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean



<P>on: do not doubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied



<P>missionary labours.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want:

I can



<P>set you your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you



<P>from moment to moment. This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I



<P>know your powers) you would be as strong and apt as myself, and



<P>would not require my help.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But my powers- where are they for this undertaking? I

do not



<P>feel them. Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk. I am sensible



<P>of no light kindling- no life quickening- no voice counselling or



<P>cheering. Oh, I wish I could make you see how much my mind is at



<P>this moment like a rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered



<P>in its depths- the fear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I



<P>cannot accomplish!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have an answer for you- hear it. I have watched you

ever since



<P>we first met: I have made you my study for ten months. I have proved



<P>you in that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?



<P>In the village school I found you could perform well, punctually,



<P>uprightly, labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw



<P>you could perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you



<P>controlled. In the calm with which you learnt you had become



<P>suddenly rich, I read a mind clear of the vice of Demas:- lucre had

no



<P>undue power over you. In the resolute readiness with which you cut



<P>your wealth into four shares, keeping but one to yourself, and



<P>relinquishing the three others to the claim of abstract justice, I



<P>recognised a soul that revelled in the flame and excitement of



<P>sacrifice. In the tractability with which, at my wish, you forsook a



<P>study in which you were interested, and adopted another because it



<P>interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have since



<P>persevered in it- in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with



<P>which you have met its difficulties- I acknowledge the complement of



<P>the qualities I seek. Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,



<P>faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic:



<P>cease to mistrust yourself- I can trust you unreservedly. As a



<P>conductress of Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your



<P>assistance will be to me invaluable.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced

with



<P>slow, sure step. Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his



<P>succeeded in making the way, which had seemed blocked up,



<P>comparatively clear. My work, which had appeared so vague, so



<P>hopelessly diffuse, condensed itself as he proceeded, and assumed a



<P>definite form under his shaping hand. He waited for an answer. I



<P>demanded a quarter of an hour to think, before I again hazarded a



<P>reply.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very willingly,' he rejoined; and rising, he strode a

little



<P>distance up the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and



<P>there lay still.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I can do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and



<P>acknowledge that,' I meditated,- 'that is, if life be spared me. But

I



<P>feel mine is not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian



<P>sun. What then? He does not care for that: when my time came to die,



<P>he would resign me, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who



<P>gave me. The case is very plain before me. In leaving England, I



<P>should leave a loved but empty land- Mr. Rochester is not there; and



<P>if he were, what is, what can that ever be to me? My business is to



<P>live without him now: nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from



<P>day to day, as if I were waiting some impossible change in



<P>circumstances, which might reunite me to him. Of course (as St. John



<P>once said) I must seek another interest in life to replace the one



<P>lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the most glorious



<P>man can adopt or God assign? Is it not, by its noble cares and sublime



<P>results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by uptorn



<P>affections and demolished hopes? I believe I must say, Yes- and yet



<P>I shudder. Alas! If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go

to



<P>India, I go to premature death. And how will the interval between



<P>leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled? Oh, I



<P>know well! That, too, is very clear to my vision. By straining to



<P>satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I shall satisfy him- to the



<P>finest central point and farthest outward circle of his



<P>expectations. If I do go with him- if I do make the sacrifice he



<P>urges, I will make it absolutely: I will throw all on the altar-



<P>heart, vitals, the entire victim. He will never love me; but he



<P>shall approve me; I will show him energies he has not yet seen,



<P>resources he has never suspected. Yes, I can work as hard as he can,



<P>and with as little grudging.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one

item- one



<P>dreadful item. It is- that he asks me to be his wife, and has no



<P>more of a husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock,



<P>down which the stream is foaming in yonder gorge. He prizes me as a



<P>soldier would a good weapon, and that is all. Unmarried to him, this



<P>would never grieve me; but can I let him complete his calculations-



<P>coolly put into practice his plans- go through the wedding ceremony?



<P>Can I receive from him the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love



<P>(which I doubt not he would scrupulously observe) and know that the



<P>spirit was quite absent? Can I bear the consciousness that every



<P>endearment he bestows is a sacrifice made on principle? No: such a



<P>martyrdom would be monstrous. I will never undergo it. As his



<P>sister, I might accompany him- not as his wife: I will tell him so.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate



<P>column; his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen. He



<P>started to his feet and approached me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am ready to go to India, if I may go free.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your answer requires a commentary,' he said; 'it is not

clear.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have hitherto been my adopted brother- I, your adopted

sister:



<P>let us continue as such: you and I had better not marry.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He shook his head. 'Adopted fraternity will not do in this

case. If



<P>you were my real sister it would be different: I should take you,



<P>and seek no wife. But as it is, either our union must be consecrated



<P>and sealed by marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose



<P>themselves to any other plan. Do you not see it, Jane? Consider a



<P>moment- your strong sense will guide you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed

me



<P>only to the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife



<P>should: and therefore it inferred we ought not to marry. I said so.



<P>'St. John,' I returned, 'I regard you as a brother- you, me as a



<P>sister: so let us continue.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We cannot- we cannot,' he answered, with short, sharp



<P>determination: 'it would not do. You have said you will go with me



<P>to India: remember- you have said that.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Conditionally.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well- well. To the main point- the departure with me from

England,



<P>the co-operation with me in my future labours- you do not object.



<P>You have already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too



<P>consistent to withdraw it. You have but one end to keep in view- how



<P>the work you have undertaken can best be done. Simplify your



<P>complicated interests, feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all



<P>considerations in one purpose: that of fulfilling with effect- with



<P>power- the mission of your great Master. To do so, you must have a



<P>coadjutor: not a brother- that is a loose tie- but a husband. I,



<P>too, do not want a sister: a sister might any day be taken from me.



<P>I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in



<P>life, and retain absolutely till death.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow-

his



<P>hold on my limbs.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted

to you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'One fitted to my purpose, you mean- fitted to my vocation.

Again I



<P>tell you it is not the insignificant private individual- the mere man,



<P>with the man's selfish senses- I wish to mate: it is the missionary.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And I will give the missionary my energies- it is all

he wants-



<P>but not myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the



<P>kernel. For them he has no use: I retain them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You cannot- you ought not. Do you think God will be satisfied

with



<P>half an oblation? Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice? It is the



<P>cause of God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you. I



<P>cannot accept on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! I will give my heart to God,' I said. 'You do not

want it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not swear, reader, that there was not something

of repressed



<P>sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in



<P>the feeling that accompanied it. I had silently feared St. John till



<P>now, because I had not understood him. He had held me in awe,



<P>because he had held me in doubt. How much of him was saint, how much



<P>mortal, I could not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made



<P>in this conference: the analysis of his nature was proceeding before



<P>my eyes. I saw his fallibilities: I comprehended them. I understood



<P>that, sitting there where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that



<P>handsome form before me, I sat at the feet of a man, erring as I.



<P>The veil fell from his hardness and despotism. Having felt in him



<P>the presence of these qualities, I felt his imperfection and took



<P>courage. I was with an equal- one with whom I might argue- one whom,



<P>if I saw good, I might resist.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and

I



<P>presently risked an upward glance at his countenance. His eye, bent

on



<P>me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry. 'Is she



<P>sarcastic, and sarcastic to me!' it seemed to say. 'What does this



<P>signify?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter,' he

said ere



<P>long; 'one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.



<P>I trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will give your



<P>heart to God: it is all I want. Once wrench your heart from man, and



<P>fix it on your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual



<P>kingdom on earth will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will

be



<P>ready to do at once whatever furthers that end. You will see what



<P>impetus would be given to your efforts and mine by our physical and



<P>mental union in marriage: the only union that gives a character of



<P>permanent conformity to the destinies and designs of human beings;



<P>and, passing over all minor caprices- all trivial difficulties and



<P>delicacies of feeling- all scruple about the degree, kind, strength

or



<P>tenderness of mere personal inclination- you will hasten to enter into



<P>that union at once.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shall I?' I said briefly; and I looked at his features,



<P>beautiful in their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still



<P>severity; at his brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright



<P>and deep and searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure;



<P>and fancied myself in idea his wife. Oh! it would never do! As his



<P>curate, his comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him



<P>in that capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him



<P>in that office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and



<P>vigour; accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at



<P>his ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:



<P>profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other. I should



<P>suffer often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body



<P>would be under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would

be



<P>free. I should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural



<P>unenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of



<P>loneliness. There would be recesses in my mind which would be only



<P>mine, to which he never came, and sentiments growing there fresh and



<P>sheltered which his austerity could never blight, nor his measured



<P>warrior-march trample down: but as his wife- at his side always, and



<P>always restrained, and always checked- forced to keep the fire of my



<P>nature continually low, to compel it to burn inwardly and never



<P>utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame consumed vital after vital-



<P>this would be unendurable.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John!' I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well?' he answered icily.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your



<P>fellow-missionary, but not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become



<P>part of you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A part of me you must become,' he answered steadily: 'otherwise



<P>the whole bargain is void. How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out



<P>with me to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?



<P>How can we be for ever together- sometimes in solitudes, sometimes



<P>amidst savage tribes- and unwed?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very well,' I said shortly; 'under the circumstances,

quite as



<P>well as if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman



<P>like yourself.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce

you



<P>as such: to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us



<P>both. And for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you



<P>have a woman's heart and- it would not do.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It would do,' I affirmed with some disdain, 'perfectly

well. I



<P>have a woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I



<P>have only a comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness,



<P>fidelity, fraternity, if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission



<P>to his hierophant: nothing more- don't fear.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is what I want,' he said, speaking to himself; 'it

is just what



<P>I want. And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.



<P>Jane, you would not repent marrying me- be certain of that; we must

be



<P>married. I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough

of



<P>love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your



<P>eyes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I scorn your idea of love,' I could not help saying, as

I rose



<P>up and stood before him, leaning my back against the rock. 'I scorn



<P>the counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you



<P>when you offer it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips

while he did



<P>so. Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy



<P>to tell: he could command his countenance thoroughly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you,'

he said: 'I



<P>think I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high,

calm



<P>mien.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault

that I



<P>have been roused to speak so unguardedly. You have introduced a



<P>topic on which our natures are at variance- a topic we should never



<P>discuss: the very name of love is an apple of discord between us. If



<P>the reality were required, what should we do? How should we feel? My



<P>dear cousin, abandon your scheme of marriage- forget it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No,' said he; 'it is a long-cherished scheme, and the

only one



<P>which can secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at



<P>present. To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends



<P>there to whom I should wish to say farewell. I shall be absent a



<P>fortnight- take that space of time to consider my offer: and do not



<P>forget that if you reject it, it is not me you deny, but God.



<P>Through my means, He opens to you a noble career; as my wife only



<P>can you enter upon it. Refuse to be my wife, and you limit yourself



<P>for ever to a track of selfish ease and barren obscurity. Tremble lest



<P>in that case you should be numbered with those who have denied the



<P>faith, and are worse than infidels!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He had done. Turning from me, he once more

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

'Looked to river, looked to hill.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not



<P>worthy to hear them uttered. As I walked by his side homeward, I



<P>read well in his iron silence all he felt towards me: the



<P>disappointment of an austere and despotic nature, which has met



<P>resistance where it expected submission- the disapprobation of a cool,



<P>inflexible judgment, which has detected in another feelings and



<P>views in which it has no power to sympathise: in short, as a man, he



<P>would have wished to coerce me into obedience: it was only as a



<P>sincere Christian he bore so patiently with my perversity, and allowed



<P>so long a space for reflection and repentance.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought

proper to



<P>forget even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence. I-



<P>who, though I had no love, had much friendship for him- was hurt by



<P>the marked omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,' said

Diana,



<P>'during your walk on the moor. But go after him; he is now lingering



<P>in the passage expecting you- he will make it up.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would

always



<P>rather be happy than dignified; and I ran after him- he stood at the



<P>foot of the stairs.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-night, St. John,' said I.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-night, Jane,' he replied calmly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then shake hands,' I added.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What a cold, loose touch he impressed on my fingers! He

was



<P>deeply displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would



<P>not warm, nor tears move him. No happy reconciliation was to be had



<P>with him- no cheering smile or generous word: but still the



<P>Christian was patient and placid; and when I asked him if he forgave



<P>me, he answered that he was not in the habit of cherishing the



<P>remembrance of vexation; that he had nothing to forgive, not having



<P>been offended.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And with that answer he left me. I would much rather he

had knocked



<P>me down.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; HE did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had

said he



<P>would. He deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time

he



<P>made me feel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a



<P>conscientious yet implacable man can inflict on one who has offended



<P>him. Without one overt act of hostility, one upbraiding word he



<P>contrived to impress me momently with the conviction that I was put



<P>beyond the pale of his favour.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness-



<P>not that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully



<P>in his power to do so. Both by nature and principle, he was superior



<P>to the mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for



<P>saying I scorned him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words;



<P>and as long as he and I lived he never would forget them. I saw by his



<P>look, when he turned to me, that they were always written on the air



<P>between me and him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to



<P>his ear, and their echo toned every answer he gave me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called

me as



<P>usual each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man



<P>within him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure



<P>Christian, in evincing with what skill he could, while acting and



<P>speaking apparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every



<P>phrase the spirit of interest and approval which had formerly



<P>communicated a certain austere charm to his language and manner. To



<P>me, he was in reality become no longer flesh, but marble; his eye



<P>was a cold, bright, blue gem; his tongue a speaking instrument-



<P>nothing more.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All this was torture to me- refined, lingering torture.

It kept



<P>up a slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief,



<P>which harassed and crushed me altogether. I felt how- if I were his



<P>wife, this good man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon



<P>kill me, without drawing from my veins a single drop of blood, or



<P>receiving on his own crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime.



<P>Especially I felt this when I made any attempt to propitiate him. No



<P>ruth met my ruth. He experienced no suffering from estrangement- no



<P>yearning after reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast



<P>falling tears blistered the page over which we both bent, they



<P>produced no more effect on him than if his heart had been really a



<P>matter of stone or metal. To his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat



<P>kinder than usual: as if afraid that mere coldness would not



<P>sufficiently convince me how completely I was banished and banned,



<P>he added the force of contrast; and this I am sure he did not by



<P>malice, but on principle.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The night before he left home, happening to see him walking

in



<P>the garden about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that



<P>this man, alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that

we



<P>were near relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain



<P>his friendship. I went out and approached him as he stood leaning over



<P>the little gate; I spoke to the point at once.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with

me. Let us



<P>be friends.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hope we are friends,' was the unmoved reply; while he

still



<P>watched the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I



<P>approached.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, St. John, we are not friends as we were. You know

that.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are we not? That is wrong. For my part, I wish you no

ill and



<P>all good.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable

of



<P>wishing any one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire



<P>somewhat more of affection than that sort of general philanthropy



<P>you extend to mere strangers.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course,' he said. 'Your wish is reasonable, and I am

far from



<P>regarding you as a stranger.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and



<P>baffling enough. Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire,

I



<P>should immediately have left him; but something worked within me



<P>more strongly than those feelings could. I deeply venerated my



<P>cousin's talent and principle. His friendship was of value to me: to



<P>lose it tried me severely. I would not so soon relinquish the



<P>attempt to reconquer it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Must we part in this way, St. John? And when you go to

India, will



<P>you leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you! What! do you

not go to



<P>India?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You said I could not unless I married you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you will not marry me! You adhere to that resolution?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people

can put



<P>into the ice of their questions? How much of the fall of the avalanche



<P>is in their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their



<P>displeasure?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, St. John, I will not marry you. I adhere to my resolution.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but

it did



<P>not yet crash down.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Once more, why this refusal?' he asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Formerly,' I answered, 'because you did not love me; now,

I reply,



<P>because you almost hate me. If I were to marry you, you would kill me.



<P>You are killing me now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; His lips and cheeks turned white- quite white.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I should kill you- I am killing you? Your words are such

as



<P>ought not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue. They betray



<P>an unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would



<P>seem inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow



<P>even until seventy-and-seven times.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had finished the business now. While earnestly wishing

to erase



<P>from his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that



<P>tenacious surface another and far deeper impression: I had burnt it



<P>in.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now you will indeed hate me,' I said. 'It is useless to

attempt to



<P>conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because

they



<P>touched on the truth. That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary



<P>spasm. I knew the steely ire I had whetted. I was heart-wrung.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You utterly misinterpret my words,' I said, at once seizing

his



<P>hand: 'I have no intention to grieve or pain you- indeed, I have not.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most bitterly he smiled- most decidedly he withdrew his

hand from



<P>mine. 'And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at



<P>all, I presume?' said he, after a considerable pause.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, I will, as your assistant,' I answered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A very long silence succeeded. What struggle there was

in him



<P>between Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only



<P>singular gleams scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed



<P>over his face. He spoke at last.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman

of your age



<P>proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine. I proved it to you



<P>in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your



<P>ever again alluding to the plan. That you have done so, I regret-



<P>for your sake.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I interrupted him. Anything like a tangible reproach gave

me



<P>courage at once. 'Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on



<P>nonsense. You pretend to be shocked by what I have said. You are not



<P>really shocked: for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either



<P>so dull or so conceited as to misunderstand my meaning. I say again,

I



<P>will be your curate, if you like, but never your wife.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled

his



<P>passion perfectly. He answered emphatically but calmly-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit

me. With me,



<P>then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer,

I



<P>will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs

a



<P>coadjutor. Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's



<P>aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your



<P>promise and deserting the band you engaged to join.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any

formal



<P>promise or entered into any engagement; and this language was all much



<P>too hard and much too despotic for the occasion. I replied-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion

in the



<P>case. I am not under the slightest obligation to go to India,



<P>especially with strangers. With you I would have ventured much,



<P>because I admire, confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am



<P>convinced that, go when and with whom I would, I should not live



<P>long in that climate.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! you are afraid of yourself,' he said, curling his

lip.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am. God did not give me my life to throw away; and to

do as



<P>you wish me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to



<P>committing suicide. Moreover, before I definitely resolve on



<P>quitting England, I will know for certain whether I cannot be of



<P>greater use by remaining in it than by leaving it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do you mean?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there

is a



<P>point on which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere



<P>till by some means that doubt is removed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I know where your heart turns and to what it clings. The



<P>interest you cherish is lawless and unconsecrated. Long since you



<P>ought to have crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it. You



<P>think of Mr. Rochester?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was true. I confessed it by silence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I must find out what is become of him.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It remains for me, then,' he said, 'to remember you in

my prayers,



<P>and to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not



<P>indeed become a castaway. I had thought I recognised in you one of the



<P>chosen. But God sees not as man sees: His will be done.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away

down the



<P>glen. He was soon out of sight.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the

window,



<P>looking very thoughtful. Diana was a great deal taller than I:. she



<P>put her hand on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane,' she said, 'you are always agitated and pale now.

I am



<P>sure there is something the matter. Tell me what business St. John and



<P>you have on hands. I have watched you this half hour from the



<P>window; you must forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I



<P>have fancied I hardly know what. St. John is a strange being-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused- I did not speak: soon she resumed-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some

sort



<P>respecting you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice



<P>and interest he never showed to any one else- to what end? I wish he



<P>loved you- does he, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; 'No, Die, not one

whit.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get

you so



<P>frequently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?



<P>Mary and I had both concluded he wished you to marry him.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He does- he has asked me to be his wife.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Diana clapped her hands. 'That is just what we hoped and

thought!



<P>And you will marry him, Jane, won't you? And then he will stay in



<P>England.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me

is to



<P>procure a fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What! He wishes you to go to India?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madness!' she exclaimed. 'You would not live three months

there, I



<P>am certain. You never shall go: you have not consented, have you,



<P>Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have refused to marry him-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And have consequently displeased him?' she suggested.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered

to



<P>accompany him as his sister.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was frantic folly to do so, Jane. Think of the task

you



<P>undertook- one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the



<P>strong, and you are weak. St. John- you know him- would urge you to



<P>impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest



<P>during the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he



<P>exacts, you force yourself to perform. I am astonished you found



<P>courage to refuse his hand. You do not love him then, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not as a husband.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet he is a handsome fellow.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And I am so plain, you see, Die. We should never suit.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Plain! You? Not at all. You are much too pretty, as well

as too



<P>good, to be grilled alive in Calcutta.' And again she earnestly



<P>conjured me to give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I must indeed,' I said; 'for when just now I repeated

the offer of



<P>serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of



<P>decency. He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in



<P>proposing to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first



<P>hoped to find in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You should hear himself on the subject. He has again and

again



<P>explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.

He



<P>has told me I am formed for labour- not for love: which is true, no



<P>doubt. But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows



<P>that I am not formed for marriage. Would it not be strange, Die, to

be



<P>chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Insupportable- unnatural- out of the question!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And then,' I continued, 'though I have only sisterly affection

for



<P>him now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the



<P>possibility of conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of



<P>love for him, because he is so talented; and there is often a



<P>certain heroic grandeur in his look, manner, and conversation. In that



<P>case, my lot would become unspeakably wretched. He would not want me



<P>to love him; and if I showed the feeling, he would make me sensible



<P>that it was a superfluity, unrequired by him, unbecoming in me. I know



<P>he would.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And yet St. John is a good man,' said Diana.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly,

the



<P>feelings and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.



<P>It is better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way,



<P>lest, in his progress, he should trample them down. Here he comes! I



<P>will leave you, Diana.' And I hastened upstairs as I saw him



<P>entering the garden.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But I was forced to meet him again at supper. During that

meal he



<P>appeared just as composed as usual. I had thought he would hardly



<P>speak to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his



<P>matrimonial scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.



<P>He addressed me precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of



<P>late, been his ordinary manner- one scrupulously polite. No doubt he



<P>had invoked the help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had



<P>roused in him, and now believed he had forgiven me once more.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the



<P>twenty-first chapter of Revelation. It was at all times pleasant to



<P>listen while from his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did



<P>his fine voice sound at once so sweet and full- never did his manner



<P>become so impressive in its noble simplicity, as when he delivered the



<P>oracles of God: and to-night that voice took a more solemn tone-



<P>that manner a more thrilling meaning- as he sat in the midst of his



<P>household circle (the May moon shining in through the uncurtained



<P>window, and rendering almost unnecessary the light of the candle on



<P>the table): as he sat there, bending over the great old Bible, and



<P>described from its page the vision of the new heaven and the new



<P>earth- told how God would come to dwell with men, how He would wipe



<P>away all tears from their eyes, and promised that there should be no



<P>more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any more pain, because



<P>the former things were passed away.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke

them:



<P>especially as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in



<P>sound, that in uttering them, his eye had turned on me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will

be his



<P>God, and he shall be my son. But,' was slowly, distinctly read, 'the



<P>fearful, the unbelieving, etc., shall have their part in the lake



<P>which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness,

marked



<P>his enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter. The



<P>reader believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of



<P>life, and he yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city



<P>to which the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which



<P>has no need of sun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God



<P>lightens it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered-

all



<P>his stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and



<P>resolved on a conquest. He supplicated strength for the



<P>weak-hearted; guidance for wanderers from the fold: a return, even



<P>at the eleventh hour, for those whom the temptations of the world



<P>and the flesh were luring from the narrow path. He asked, he urged,

he



<P>claimed the boon of a brand snatched from the burning. Earnestness



<P>is ever deeply solemn: first, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered



<P>at his; then, when it continued and rose, I was touched by it, and



<P>at last awed. He felt the greatness and goodness of his purpose so



<P>sincerely: others who heard him plead for it, could not but feel it



<P>too.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at

a very early



<P>hour in the morning. Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the



<P>room- in compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I



<P>tendered my hand, and wished him a pleasant journey.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you, Jane. As I said, I shall return from Cambridge

in a



<P>fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection. If I



<P>listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage



<P>with me; but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first



<P>aim- to do all things to the glory of God. My Master was



<P>long-suffering: so will I be. I cannot give you up to perdition as a



<P>vessel of wrath: repent- resolve, while there is yet time. Remember,



<P>we are bid to work while it is day- warned that "the night cometh when



<P>no man shall work." Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good



<P>things in this life. God give you strength to choose that better



<P>part which shall not be taken from you!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.

He had



<P>spoken earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover



<P>beholding his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his



<P>wandering sheep- or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul



<P>for which he is responsible. All men of talent, whether they be men

of



<P>feeling or not; whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots-



<P>provided only they be sincere- have their sublime moments, when they



<P>subdue and rule. I felt veneration for St. John- veneration so



<P>strong that its impetus thrust me at once to the point I had so long



<P>shunned. I was tempted to cease struggling with him- to rush down



<P>the torrent of his will into the gulf of his existence, and there lose



<P>my own. I was almost as hard beset by him now as I had been once



<P>before, in a different way, by another. I was a fool both times. To



<P>have yielded then would have been an error of principle; to have



<P>yielded now would have been an error of judgment. So I think at this



<P>hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet medium of time:



<P>I was unconscious of folly at the instant.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch. My refusals

were



<P>forgotten- my fears overcome- my wrestlings paralysed. The Impossible-



<P>i.e., my marriage with St. John- was fast becoming the Possible. All



<P>was changing utterly with a sudden sweep. Religion called- Angels



<P>beckoned- God commanded- life rolled together like a scroll- death's



<P>gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that for safety



<P>and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second. The dim



<P>room was full of visions.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Could you decide now?' asked the missionary. The inquiry

was put



<P>in gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently. Oh, that gentleness! how



<P>far more potent is it than force! I could resist St. John's wrath: I



<P>grew pliant as a reed under his kindness. Yet I knew all the time,



<P>if I yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day,



<P>of my former rebellion. His nature was not changed by one hour of



<P>solemn prayer: it was only elevated.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I could decide if I were but certain,' I answered: 'were

I but



<P>convinced that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to



<P>marry you here and now- come afterwards what would!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My prayers are heard!' ejaculated St. John. He pressed

his hand



<P>firmer on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm,



<P>almost as if he loved me (I say almost- I knew the difference- for I



<P>had felt what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love



<P>out of the question, and thought only of duty). I contended with my



<P>inward dimness of vision, before which clouds yet rolled. I sincerely,



<P>deeply, fervently longed to do what was right; and only that. 'Show



<P>me, show me the path!' I entreated of Heaven. I was excited more



<P>than I had ever been; and whether what followed was the effect of



<P>excitement the reader shall judge.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All the house was still; for I believe all, except St.

John and



<P>myself, were now retired to rest. The one candle was dying out: the



<P>room was full of moonlight. My heart beat fast and thick: I heard



<P>its throb. Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that



<P>thrilled it through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.



<P>The feeling was not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp,



<P>as strange, as startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost



<P>activity hitherto had been but torpor, from which they were now



<P>summoned and forced to wake. They rose expectant: eye and ear waited



<P>while the flesh quivered on my bones.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What have you heard? What do you see?' asked St. John.

I saw



<P>nothing, but I heard a voice somewhere cry-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane! Jane! Jane!'- nothing more.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'O God! what is it?' I gasped.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I might have said, 'Where is it?' for it did not seem in

the



<P>room- nor in the house- nor in the garden; it did not come out of



<P>the air- nor from under the earth- nor from overhead. I had heard



<P>it- where, or whence, for ever impossible to know! And it was the



<P>voice of a human being- a known, loved, well-remembered voice- that

of



<P>Edward Fairfax Rochester; and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly,



<P>eerily, urgently.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am coming!' I cried. 'Wait for me! Oh, I will come!'

I flew to



<P>the door and looked into the passage: it was dark. I ran out into



<P>the garden: it was void.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where are you?' I exclaimed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back-

'Where



<P>are you?' I listened. The wind sighed low in the firs: all was



<P>moorland loneliness and midnight hush.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Down superstition!' I commented, as that spectre rose

up black



<P>by the black yew at the gate. 'This is not thy deception, nor thy



<P>witchcraft: it is the work of nature. She was roused, and did- no



<P>miracle- but her best.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have

detained



<P>me. It was my time to assume ascendency. My powers were in play and

in



<P>force. I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to



<P>leave me: I must and would be alone. He obeyed at once. Where there

is



<P>energy to command well enough, obedience never fails. I mounted to



<P>my chamber; locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my



<P>way- a different way to St. John's, but effective in its own



<P>fashion. I seemed to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my



<P>soul rushed out in gratitude at His feet. I rose from the



<P>thanksgiving- took a resolve- and lay down, unscared, enlightened-



<P>eager but for the daylight.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; PRESENTIMENTS are strange things! and so are sympathies;

and so are



<P>signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has



<P>not yet found the key. I never laughed at presentiments in my life,



<P>because I have had strange ones of my own. Sympathies, I believe,



<P>exist (for instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly



<P>estranged relatives asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the



<P>unity of the source to which each traces his origin) whose workings



<P>baffle mortal comprehension. And signs, for aught we know, may be



<P>but the sympathies of Nature with man.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night

heard



<P>Bessie Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a



<P>little child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of



<P>trouble, either to one's self or one's kin. The saying might have worn



<P>out of my memory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which



<P>served indelibly to fix it there. The next day Bessie was sent for



<P>home to the deathbed of her little sister.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident;

for



<P>during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that



<P>had not brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed



<P>in my arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing



<P>with daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.



<P>It was a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now

it



<P>nestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the



<P>apparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven



<P>successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not like this iteration of one idea- this strange



<P>recurrence of one image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached



<P>and the hour of the vision drew near. It was from companionship with



<P>this baby-phantom I had been roused on that moonlight night when I



<P>heard the cry; and it was on the afternoon of the day following I



<P>was summoned downstairs by a message that some one wanted me in Mrs.



<P>Fairfax's room. On repairing thither, I found a man waiting for me,



<P>having the appearance of a gentleman's servant: he was dressed in deep



<P>mourning, and the hat he held in his hand was surrounded with a



<P>crape band.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,' he said, rising

as I



<P>entered; 'but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed



<P>when you were at Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live



<P>there still.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, Robert! how do you do? I remember you very well: you

used to



<P>give me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony. And how is



<P>Bessie? You are married to Bessie?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought

me



<P>another little one about two months since- we have three now- and both



<P>mother and child are thriving.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And are the family well at the house, Robert?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss:

they are



<P>very badly at present- in great trouble.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hope no one is dead,' I said, glancing at his black

dress. He



<P>too looked down at the crape round his hat and replied-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in

London.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. John?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And how does his mother bear it?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his

life has



<P>been very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange



<P>ways, and his death was shocking.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I heard from Bessie he was not doing well.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Doing well! He could not do worse: he ruined his health

and his



<P>estate amongst the worst men and the worst women. He got into debt and



<P>into jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free



<P>he returned to his old companions and habits. His head was not strong:



<P>the knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.



<P>He came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to



<P>give up all to him. Missis refused: her means have long been much



<P>reduced by his extravagance; so he went back again, and the next



<P>news was that he was dead. How he died, God knows!- they say he killed



<P>himself.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was silent: the tidings were frightful. Robert Leaven

resumed-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she

had got



<P>very stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear



<P>of poverty were quite breaking her down. The information about Mr.



<P>John's death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a



<P>stroke. She was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she



<P>seemed rather better: she appeared as if she wanted to say



<P>something, and kept making signs to my wife and mumbling. It was



<P>only yesterday morning, however, that Bessie understood she was



<P>pronouncing your name; and at last she made out the words, "Bring



<P>Jane- fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to her." Bessie is not sure



<P>whether she is in her right mind, or means anything by the words;



<P>but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and advised them to send



<P>for you. The young ladies put it off at first; but their mother grew



<P>so restless, and said, "Jane, Jane," so many times, that at last



<P>they consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can get



<P>ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow



<P>morning.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought

to go.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think so too, Miss. Bessie said she was sure you would

not



<P>refuse: but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get



<P>off?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; and I will do it now'; and having directed him to

the



<P>servants' hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and



<P>the attentions of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the

yard, the



<P>stables, or the grounds. I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;-



<P>yes: she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram. To the



<P>billiard-room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices



<P>resounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton,



<P>and their admirers, were all busied in the game. It required some



<P>courage to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one



<P>I could not defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss



<P>Ingram's side. She turned as I drew near, and looked at me



<P>haughtily: her eyes seemed to demand, 'What can the creeping



<P>creature want now?' and when I said, in a low voice, 'Mr.



<P>Rochester,' she made a movement as if tempted to order me away. I



<P>remember her appearance at the moment- it was very graceful and very



<P>striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure



<P>scarf was twisted in her hair. She had been all animation with the



<P>game, and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her



<P>haughty lineaments.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Does that person want you?' she inquired of Mr. Rochester;

and Mr.



<P>Rochester turned to see who the 'person' was. He made a curious



<P>grimace- one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations- threw down



<P>his cue and followed me from the room.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, Jane?' he said, as he rested his back against the



<P>school-room door, which he had shut.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week

or two.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What to do?- where to go?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To see a sick lady who has sent for me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What sick lady?- where does she live?'



<P>for people to see her that distance?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Her name is Reed sir- Mrs. Reed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Reed of Gateshead? There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is his widow, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what have you to do with her? How do you know her?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Reed was my uncle- my mother's brother.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The deuce he was! You never told me that before: you always

said



<P>you had no relations.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'None that would own me, sir. Mr. Reed is dead, and his

wife cast



<P>me off.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But Reed left children?- you must have cousins? Sir George

Lynn



<P>was talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one

of



<P>the veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana



<P>Reed of the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season



<P>or two ago in London.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined

his



<P>family, and is supposed to have committed suicide. The news so shocked



<P>his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what good can you do her? Nonsense, Jane! I would

never



<P>think of running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps,



<P>be dead before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances

were



<P>very different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How long will you stay?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'As short a time as possible, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Promise me only to stay a week-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break

it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'At all events you will come back: you will not be induced

under



<P>any pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, no! I shall certainly return if all be well.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And who goes with you? You don't travel a hundred miles

alone.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir, she has sent her coachman.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A person to be trusted?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester meditated. 'When do you wish to go?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Early to-morrow morning, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without

money,



<P>and I daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet. How



<P>much have you in the world, Jane?' he asked, smiling.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was. 'Five shillings,



<P>sir.' He took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and



<P>chuckled over it as if its scantiness amused him. Soon he produced his



<P>pocket-book: 'Here,' said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds,



<P>and he owed me but fifteen. I told him I had no change.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't want change; you know that. Take your wages.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I declined accepting more than was my due. He scowled at

first;



<P>then, as if recollecting something, he said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Right, right! Better not give you all now: you would,

perhaps,



<P>stay away three months if you had fifty pounds. There are ten; is it



<P>not plenty?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, but now you owe me five.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of

business to



<P>you while I have the opportunity.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Matter of business? I am curious to hear it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going

shortly



<P>to be married?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; what then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure

you will



<P>perceive the necessity of it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise

walk over



<P>her rather too emphatically? There's sense in the suggestion; not a



<P>doubt of it. Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course,



<P>must march straight to- the devil?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In course!' he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a

distortion



<P>of features equally fantastic and ludicrous. He looked at me some



<P>minutes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will

be



<P>solicited by you to seek a place, I suppose?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would

justify



<P>me in asking favours of them- but I shall advertise.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!' he growled.

'At your



<P>peril you advertise! I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead



<P>of ten pounds. Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And so have I, sir,' I returned, putting my hands and

my purse



<P>behind me. 'I could not spare the money on any account.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Little niggard!' said he, 'refusing me a pecuniary request!

Give



<P>me five pounds, Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just let me look at the cash.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir; you are not to be trusted.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Promise me one thing.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely

to



<P>perform.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation

to me.



<P>I'll find you one in time.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will



<P>promise that I and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before



<P>your bride enters it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very well! very well! I'll pledge my word on it. You go

to-morrow,



<P>then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir; early.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir, I must prepare for the journey.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I suppose so, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?

Teach



<P>me; I'm not quite up to it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then say it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What must I say?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The same, if you like, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.

I



<P>should like something else: a little addition to the rite. If one



<P>shook hands, for instance; but no- that would not content me either.



<P>So you'll do no more than say Farewell, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in

one hearty



<P>word as in many.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very likely; but it is blank and cool- "Farewell."'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How long is he going to stand with his back against that

door?'



<P>I asked myself; 'I want to commence my packing.' The dinner-bell rang,



<P>and suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no



<P>more during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in

the



<P>afternoon of the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to



<P>the hall. It was very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung



<P>with little white curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and



<P>fire-irons were burnished bright, and the fire burnt clear. Bessie sat



<P>on the hearth, nursing her last-born, and Robert and his sister played



<P>quietly in a corner.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Bless you!- I knew you would come!' exclaimed Mrs. Leaven,

as I



<P>entered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Bessie,' said I, after I had kissed her; 'and I trust

I am



<P>not too late. How is Mrs. Reed?- Alive still, I hope.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than

she was.



<P>The doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks



<P>she will finally recover.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Has she mentioned me lately?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing

you would



<P>come: but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up



<P>at the house. She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the



<P>afternoon, and wakes up about six or seven. Will you rest yourself



<P>here an hour, Miss, and then I will go up with you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child

in the



<P>cradle and went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking



<P>off my bonnet and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and



<P>tired. I was glad to accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be



<P>relieved of my travelling garb just as passively as I used to let



<P>her undress me when a child.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling



<P>about- setting out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and



<P>butter, toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert



<P>or Jane an occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in



<P>former days. Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light



<P>foot and good looks.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired

me to



<P>sit still, quite in her old peremptory tones. I must be served at



<P>the fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round



<P>stand with my cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to



<P>accommodate me with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery



<P>chair: and I smiled and obeyed her as in bygone days.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and

what sort



<P>of a person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a



<P>master, whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him. I told



<P>her he was rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he



<P>treated me kindly, and I was content. Then I went on to describe to



<P>her the gay company that had lately been staying at the house; and



<P>to these details Bessie listened with interest: they were precisely

of



<P>the kind she relished.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored

to me



<P>my bonnet, etc., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for



<P>the hall. It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years



<P>ago, walked down the path I was now ascending. On a dark, misty, raw



<P>morning in January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and



<P>embittered heart- a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation- to



<P>seek the chilly harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and



<P>unexplored. The same hostile roof now again rose before me: my



<P>prospects were doubtful yet; and I had yet an aching heart. I still



<P>felt as a wanderer on the face of the earth; but I experienced



<P>firmer trust in myself and my own powers, and less withering dread



<P>of oppression. The gaping wound of my wrongs, too, was now quite



<P>healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You shall go into the breakfast-room first,' said Bessie,

as she



<P>preceded me through the hall; 'the young ladies will be there.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In another moment I was within that apartment. There was

every



<P>article of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first



<P>introduced to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still



<P>covered the hearth. Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could



<P>distinguish the two volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying



<P>their old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the



<P>Arabian Nights ranged just above. The inanimate objects were not



<P>changed; but the living things had altered past recognition.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost

as



<P>tall as Miss Ingram- very thin too, with a sallow face and severe



<P>mien. There was something ascetic in her look, was augmented by the



<P>extreme plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a



<P>starched linen collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the



<P>nun-like ornament of a string of ebony beads and a crucifix. This I



<P>felt sure was Eliza, though I could trace little resemblance to her



<P>former self in that elongated and colourless visage.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana

I



<P>remembered- the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven. This was a



<P>full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and



<P>regular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.



<P>The hue of her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different



<P>from her sister's- so much more flowing and becoming- it looked as



<P>stylish as the other's looked puritanical.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother-

and



<P>only one; the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's



<P>Cairngorm eye: the blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour



<P>of jaw and chin- perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an



<P>indescribable hardness to the countenance, otherwise so voluptuous and



<P>buxom.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both



<P>addressed me by the name of 'Miss Eyre.' Eliza's greeting was



<P>delivered in a short, abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she



<P>sat down again, fixed her eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.



<P>Georgiana added to her 'How d 'ye do?' several commonplaces about my



<P>journey, the weather, and so on, uttered in rather a drawling tone:



<P>and accompanied by sundry side-glances that measured me from head to



<P>foot-now traversing the folds of my drab merino pelisse, and now



<P>lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage bonnet. Young ladies



<P>have a remarkable way of letting you know that they think you a 'quiz'



<P>without actually saying the words. A certain superciliousness of look,



<P>coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone, express fully their



<P>sentiments on the point, without committing them by any positive



<P>rudeness in word or deed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer

that



<P>power over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was



<P>surprised to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one



<P>and the semi-sarcastic attentions of the other- Eliza did not mortify,



<P>nor Georgiana ruffle me. The fact was, I had other things to think



<P>about; within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so



<P>much more potent than any they could raise- pains and pleasures so



<P>much more acute and exquisite had been excited than any it was in



<P>their power to inflict or bestow- that their airs gave me no concern



<P>either for good or bad.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How is Mrs. Reed?' I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana,



<P>who thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an



<P>unexpected liberty.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mrs. Reed? Ah, mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly:

I doubt if



<P>you can see her to-night.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If,' said I, 'you would just step upstairs and tell her

I am come,



<P>I should be much obliged to you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes

wild and



<P>wide. 'I know she had a particular wish to see me,' I added, 'and I



<P>would not defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely



<P>necessary.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,' remarked

Eliza. I



<P>soon rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and



<P>said I would just step out to Bessie- who was, I dared say, in the



<P>kitchen- and ask her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to



<P>receive me or not to-night. I went, and having found Bessie and



<P>despatched her on my errand, I proceeded to take further measures.



<P>It had heretofore been my habit always to shrink from arrogance:



<P>received as I had been to-day, I should, a year ago, have resolved



<P>to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now, it was disclosed to me



<P>all at once that that would be a foolish plan. I had taken a journey



<P>of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay with her till she



<P>was better- or dead: as to her daughters' pride or folly, I must put



<P>it on one side, make myself independent of it. So I addressed the



<P>housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should probably



<P>be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my



<P>chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Missis is awake,' said she; 'I have told her you are here:

come



<P>and let us see if she will know you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to

which I



<P>had so often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former



<P>days. I hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded



<P>light stood on the table, for it was now getting dark. There was the



<P>great four-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the



<P>toilet-table, the arm-chair, and the footstool, at which I had a



<P>hundred times been sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by



<P>me uncommitted. I looked into a certain corner near, half expecting

to



<P>see the slim outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk



<P>there, waiting to leap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or



<P>shrinking neck. I approached the bed; I opened the curtains and



<P>leant over the high-piled pillows.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought

the



<P>familiar image. It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of



<P>vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion. I had left



<P>this woman in bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with



<P>no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a



<P>strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries- to be reconciled



<P>and clasp hands in amity.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever-

there was



<P>that peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,



<P>imperious, despotic eyebrow. How often had it lowered on me menace and



<P>hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows



<P>revived as I traced its harsh line now! And yet I stooped down and



<P>kissed her: she looked at me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is this Jane Eyre?' she said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Aunt Reed. How are you, dear aunt?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again:

I



<P>thought it no sin to forget and break that vow now. My fingers had



<P>fastened on her hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine



<P>kindly, I should at that moment have experienced true pleasure. But



<P>unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural



<P>antipathies so readily eradicated. Mrs. Reed took her hand away,



<P>and, turning her face rather from me, she remarked that the night



<P>was warm. Again she regarded me so icily, I felt at once that her



<P>opinion of me- her feeling towards me- was unchanged and unchangeable.



<P>I knew by her stony eye- opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to



<P>tears- that she was resolved to consider me bad to the last; because



<P>to believe me good would give her no generous pleasure: only a sense



<P>of mortification.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination



<P>to subdue her- to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and



<P>her will. My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them



<P>back to their source. I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down



<P>and leaned over the pillow.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You sent for me,' I said, 'and I am here; and it is my

intention



<P>to stay till I see how you get on.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, of course! You have seen my daughters?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can

talk some



<P>things over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and

I



<P>have a difficulty in recalling them. But there was something I



<P>wished to say- let me see-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck

had



<P>taken place in her once vigorous frame. Turning restlessly, she drew



<P>the bedclothes round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the



<P>quilt, fixed it down: she was at once irritated.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sit up!' said she; 'don't annoy me with holding the clothes



<P>fast. Are you Jane Eyre?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am Jane Eyre.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have had more trouble with that child than any one would



<P>believe. Such a burden to be left on my hands- and so much annoyance



<P>as she caused me, daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible



<P>disposition, and her sudden starts of temper, and her continual,



<P>unnatural watchings of one's movements! I declare she talked to me



<P>once like something mad, or like a fiend- no child ever spoke or



<P>looked as she did; I was glad to get her away from the house. What did



<P>they do with her at Lowood? The fever broke out there, and many of the



<P>pupils died. She, however, did not die: but I said she did- I wish she



<P>had died!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's



<P>only sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's



<P>disowning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of



<P>her death, he wept like a simpleton. He would send for the baby;



<P>though I entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its



<P>maintenance. I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it- a



<P>sickly, whining, pining thing! It would wail in its cradle all night



<P>long- not screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering



<P>and moaning. Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it



<P>as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his



<P>own at that age. He would try to make my children friendly to the



<P>little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was angry with



<P>them when they showed their dislike. In his last illness, he had it



<P>brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he died,

he



<P>bound me by vow to keep the creature. I would as soon have been



<P>charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak,



<P>naturally weak. John does not at all resemble his father, and I am



<P>glad of it: John is like me and like my brothers- he is quite a



<P>Gibson. Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me with letters for



<P>money! I have no more money to give him: we are getting poor. I must



<P>send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let it



<P>off. I can never submit to do that- yet how are we to get on?



<P>Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of mortgages. John



<P>gambles dreadfully, and always loses- poor boy! He is beset by



<P>sharpers: John is sunk and degraded- his look is frightful- I feel



<P>ashamed for him when I see him.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She was getting much excited. 'I think I had better leave

her now,'



<P>said I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way

towards



<P>night- in the morning she is calmer.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I rose. 'Stop!' exclaimed Mrs. Reed, 'there is another

thing I



<P>wished to say. He threatens me- he continually threatens me with his



<P>own death, or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with



<P>a great wound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face. I



<P>am come to a strange pass: I have heavy troubles. What is to be



<P>done? How is the money to be had?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative



<P>draught: she succeeded with difficulty. Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew



<P>more composed, and sank into a dozing state. I then left her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation

with



<P>her. She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor



<P>forbade everything which could painfully excite her. Meantime, I got



<P>on as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza. They were very cold,



<P>indeed, at first. Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or



<P>writing, and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.



<P>Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and



<P>take no notice of me. But I was determined not to seem at a loss for



<P>occupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me,



<P>and they served me for both.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper,

I used



<P>to take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in



<P>sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened



<P>momentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of



<P>imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon,



<P>and a ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and



<P>a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf



<P>sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a

face it



<P>was to be, I did not care or know. I took a soft black pencil, gave

it



<P>a broad point, and worked away. Soon I had traced on the paper a broad



<P>and prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that



<P>contour gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it



<P>with features. Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced



<P>under that brow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with

a



<P>straight ridge and full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by

no



<P>means narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle



<P>of it: of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty



<P>hair, tufted on the temples, and waved above the forehead. Now for the



<P>eyes: I had left them to the last, because they required the most



<P>careful working. I drew them large; I shaped them well: the



<P>eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids lustrous and large.



<P>'Good! but not quite the thing,' I thought, as I surveyed the



<P>effect: 'they want more force and spirit'; and I wrought the shades



<P>blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly- a happy touch



<P>or two secured success. There, I had a friend's face under my gaze;



<P>and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs



<P>on me? I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was



<P>absorbed and content.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is that a portrait of some one you know?' asked Eliza,

who had



<P>approached me unnoticed. I responded that it was merely a fancy



<P>head, and hurried it beneath the other sheets. Of course, I lied: it



<P>was, in fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester. But



<P>what was that to her, or to any one but myself? Georgiana also



<P>advanced to look. The other drawings pleased her much, but she



<P>called that 'an ugly man.' They both seemed surprised at my skill. I



<P>offered to sketch their portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil



<P>outline. Then Georgiana produced her album. I promised to contribute

a



<P>water-colour drawing: this put her at once into good humour. She



<P>proposed a walk in the grounds. Before we had been out two hours, we



<P>were deep in a confidential conversation: she had favoured me with a



<P>description of the brilliant winter she had spent in London two



<P>seasons ago- of the admiration she had there excited- the attention



<P>she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest she



<P>had made. In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints



<P>were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and



<P>sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel



<P>of fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit. The



<P>communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the



<P>same theme- herself, her loves, and woes. It was strange she never



<P>once adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's



<P>death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects. Her mind



<P>seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and



<P>aspirations after dissipations to come. She passed about five



<P>minutes each day in her mother's sick-room, and no more.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to

talk. I



<P>never saw a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was



<P>difficult to say what she did: or rather, to discover any result of



<P>her diligence. She had an alarm to call her up early. I know not how



<P>she occupied herself before breakfast, but after that meal she divided



<P>her time into regular portions, and each hour had its allotted task.



<P>Three times a day she studied a little book, which I found, on



<P>inspection, was a Common Prayer Book. I asked her once what was the



<P>great attraction of that volume, and she said, 'the Rubric.' Three



<P>hours she gave to stitching, with gold thread, the border of a



<P>square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a carpet. In answer to



<P>my inquiries after the use of this article, she informed me it was a



<P>covering for the altar of a new church lately erected near



<P>Gateshead. Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to working by



<P>herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of her



<P>accounts. She seemed to want no company; no conversation. I believe



<P>she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing



<P>annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her



<P>to vary its clockwork regularity.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative



<P>than usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the



<P>family, had been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had



<P>now, she said, settled her mind, and formed her resolution. Her own



<P>fortune she had taken care to secure; and when her mother died- and

it



<P>was wholly improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either



<P>recover or linger long- she would execute a long-cherished project:



<P>seek a retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured



<P>from disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a



<P>frivolous world. I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course not. Georgiana and she had nothing in common:

they never



<P>had had. She would not be burdened with her society for any



<P>consideration. Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza,



<P>would take hers.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent

most of



<P>her time in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the



<P>house, and wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send



<P>her an invitation up to town. 'It would be so much better,' she



<P>said, 'if she could only get out of the way for a month or two, till



<P>all was over.' I did not ask what she meant by 'all being over,' but

I



<P>suppose she referred to the expected decease of her mother and the



<P>gloomy sequel of funeral rites. Eliza generally took no more notice

of



<P>her sister's indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring,



<P>lounging object had been before her. One day, however, as she put away



<P>her account-book and unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her

up



<P>thus-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was

certainly



<P>never allowed to cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for



<P>you make no use of life. Instead of living for, in, and with yourself,



<P>as a reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness



<P>on some other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to



<P>burden her or himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you



<P>cry out that you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable. Then, too,



<P>existence for you must be a scene of continual change and



<P>excitement, or else the world is a dungeon: you must be admired, you



<P>must be courted, you must be flattered- you must have music,



<P>dancing, and society- or you languish, you die away. Have you no sense



<P>to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts, and



<P>all wills, but your own? Take one day; share it into sections; to each



<P>section apportion its task: leave no stray unemployed quarters of an



<P>hour, ten minutes, five minutes- include all; do each piece of



<P>business in its turn with method, with rigid regularity. The day



<P>will close almost before you are aware it has begun; and you are



<P>indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant moment:



<P>you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy



<P>forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought



<P>to do. Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then



<P>you will not want me or any one else, happen what may. Neglect it-



<P>go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling- and suffer the



<P>results of your idiocy, however bad and insufferable they may be. I



<P>tell you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat



<P>what I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it. After my



<P>mother's death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is



<P>carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as



<P>separate as if we had never known each other. You need not think



<P>that because we chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer



<P>you to fasten me down by even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this-



<P>if the whole human race, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we



<P>two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you in the old world,



<P>and betake myself to the new.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She closed her lips.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering

that



<P>tirade,' answered Georgiana. 'Everybody knows you are the most



<P>selfish, heartless creature in existence: and I know your spiteful



<P>hatred towards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you



<P>played me about Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised



<P>above you, to have a title, to be received into circles where you dare



<P>not show your face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and



<P>ruined my prospects for ever.' Georgiana took out her handkerchief and



<P>blew her nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassible,



<P>and assiduously industrious.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; True, generous feeling is made small account of by some,

but here



<P>were two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other



<P>despicably savourless for the want of it. Feeling without judgment



<P>is a washy draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too



<P>bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen

asleep on



<P>the sofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a



<P>saint's-day service at the new church- for in matters of religion



<P>she was a rigid formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual



<P>discharge of what she considered her devotional duties; fair or



<P>foul, she went to church thrice every Sunday, and as often on



<P>week-days as there were prayers.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying

woman sped,



<P>who lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a



<P>remittent attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would



<P>slip out of the room whenever she could. Bessie was faithful; but



<P>she had her own family to mind, and could only come occasionally to



<P>the hall. I found the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse



<P>was there; the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid



<P>face sunk in the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate. I renewed



<P>the fuel, re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could



<P>not now gaze on me, and then I moved away to the window.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew



<P>tempestuously: 'One lies there,' I thought, 'who will soon be beyond



<P>the war of earthly elements. Whither will that spirit- now



<P>struggling to quit its material tenement- flit when at length



<P>released?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns,



<P>recalled her dying words- her faith- her doctrine of the equality of



<P>disembodied souls. I was still listening in thought to her



<P>well-remembered tones- still picturing her pale and spiritual



<P>aspect, her wasted face and sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid



<P>deathbed, and whispered her longing to be restored to her divine



<P>Father's bosom- when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind:



<P>'Who is that?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?

I



<P>went up to her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is I, Aunt Reed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who- I?' was her answer. 'Who are you?' looking at me

with



<P>surprise and a sort of alarm, but still not wildly. 'You are quite a



<P>stranger to me- where is Bessie?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is at the lodge, aunt.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Aunt,' she repeated. 'Who calls me aunt? You are not one

of the



<P>Gibsons; and yet I know you- that face, and the eyes and forehead, are



<P>quite familiar to me: you are like- why, you are like Jane Eyre!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock

by declaring



<P>my identity.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet,' said she, 'I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts



<P>deceive me. I wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where



<P>none exists: besides, in eight years she must be so changed.' I now



<P>gently assured her that I was the person she supposed and desired me



<P>to be: and seeing that I was understood, and that her senses were



<P>quite collected, I explained how Bessie had sent her husband to



<P>fetch me from Thornfield.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am very ill, I know,' she said ere long. 'I was trying

to turn



<P>myself a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb. It is as



<P>well I should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in



<P>health, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me. Is the



<P>nurse here? or is there no one in the room but you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I assured her we were alone.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.

One was in



<P>breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own



<P>child; the other-' she stopped. 'After all, it is of no great



<P>importance, perhaps,' she murmured to herself: 'and then I may get



<P>better; and to humble myself so to her is painful.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her

face



<P>changed; she seemed to experience some inward sensation- the



<P>precursor, perhaps, of the last pang.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I must get it over. Eternity is before me: I had

better tell



<P>her.- Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you



<P>will see there.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I obeyed her directions. 'Read the letter,' she said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was short, and thus conceived:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'MADAM,- Will you have the goodness to send me the address

of my



<P>niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is? It is my intention to



<P>write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira. Providence



<P>has blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am



<P>unmarried and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and



<P>bequeath her at my death whatever I may have to leave.- I am, Madam,



<P>etc., etc.,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

'JOHN EYRE, Madeira.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was dated three years back.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why did I never hear of this?' I asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever

to lend a



<P>hand in lifting you to prosperity. I could not forget your conduct



<P>to me, Jane- the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in



<P>which you declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the



<P>world; the unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the



<P>very thought of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated



<P>you with miserable cruelty. I could not forget my own sensations



<P>when you thus started up and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt



<P>fear as if an animal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me



<P>with human eyes and cursed me in a man's voice.- Bring me some



<P>water! Oh, make haste!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dear Mrs. Reed,' said I, as I offered her the draught

she



<P>required, 'think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.



<P>Forgive me for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine



<P>years have passed since that day.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted

the



<P>water and drawn breath, she went on thus-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge:

for you



<P>to be adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and



<P>comfort, was what I could not endure. I wrote to him; I said I was



<P>sorry for his disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died



<P>of typhus fever at Lowood. Now act as you please: write and contradict



<P>my assertion- expose my falsehood as soon as you like. You were



<P>born, I think, to be my torment: my last hour is racked by the



<P>recollection of a deed which, but for you, I should never have been



<P>tempted to commit.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it,

aunt, and to



<P>regard me with kindness and forgiveness-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have a very bad disposition,' said she, 'and one to

this day I



<P>feel it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be



<P>patient and quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break



<P>out all fire and violence, I can never comprehend.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate,

but



<P>not vindictive. Many a time, as a little child, I should have been



<P>glad to love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to



<P>be reconciled to you now: kiss me, aunt.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch

it. She said



<P>I oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.



<P>As I laid her down- for I raised her and supported her on my arm while



<P>she drank- I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the



<P>feeble fingers shrank from my touch- the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,' I said at last,

'you have



<P>my full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make

now the



<P>effort to change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever



<P>hated me- dying, she must hate me still.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed. I yet lingered

half



<P>an hour longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.



<P>She was fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at



<P>twelve o'clock that night she died. I was not present to close her



<P>eyes, nor were either of her daughters. They came to tell us the



<P>next morning that all was over. She was by that time laid out. Eliza



<P>and I went to look at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud



<P>weeping, said she dared not go. There was stretched Sarah Reed's



<P>once robust and active frame, rigid and still: her eye of flint was



<P>covered with its cold lid; her brow and strong traits wore yet the



<P>impress of her inexorable soul. A strange and solemn object was that



<P>corpse to me. I gazed on it with gloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing



<P>sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or subduing did it inspire; only

a



<P>grating anguish for her woes- not my loss- and a sombre tearless



<P>dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a form.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliza surveyed her parent calmly. After a silence of some

minutes



<P>she observed-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With her constitution she should have lived to a good

old age: her



<P>life was shortened by trouble.' And then a spasm constricted her mouth



<P>for an instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and

so



<P>did I. Neither of us had dropt a tear.

CHAPTER IX</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; BUT the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood

lessened.



<P>Spring drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter



<P>had ceased; its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated. My



<P>wretched feet, flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of



<P>January, began to heal and subside under the gentler breathings of



<P>April; the nights and mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature



<P>froze the very blood in our veins; we could now endure the play-hour



<P>passed in the garden: sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be



<P>pleasant and genial, and a greenness grew over those brown beds,



<P>which, freshening daily, suggested the thought that Hope traversed



<P>them at night, and left each morning brighter traces of her steps.



<P>Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves; snowdrops, crocuses, purple



<P>auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies. On Thursday afternoons



<P>(half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still sweeter flowers



<P>opening by the wayside, under the hedges.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment

which the



<P>horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls



<P>of our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits



<P>girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a



<P>bright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies. How different



<P>had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky



<P>of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!- when mists as



<P>chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those



<P>purple peaks, and rolled down 'ing' and holm till they blended with



<P>the frozen fog of the beck! That beck itself was then a torrent,



<P>turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound



<P>through the air, often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and



<P>for the forest on its banks, that showed only ranks of skeletons.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; April advanced to May: a bright, serene May it was; days

of blue



<P>sky, placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its



<P>duration. And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose



<P>its tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and



<P>oak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang



<P>up profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled



<P>its hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth



<P>of its wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in



<P>overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this

I



<P>enjoyed often and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this



<P>unwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now



<P>becomes my task to advert.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when

I speak



<P>of it as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a



<P>stream? Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is



<P>another question.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog

and



<P>fog-bred pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring,



<P>crept into the Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded



<P>schoolroom and dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the



<P>seminary into an hospital.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most

of the



<P>pupils to receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay



<P>ill at one time. Classes were broken up, rules relaxed. The few who



<P>continued well were allowed almost unlimited license; because the



<P>medical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to



<P>keep them in health: and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure



<P>to watch or restrain them. Miss Temple's whole attention was



<P>absorbed by the patients: she lived in the sick-room, never quitting



<P>it except to snatch a few hours' rest at night. The teachers were



<P>fully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations



<P>for the departure of those girls who were fortunate enough to have



<P>friends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat

of



<P>contagion. Many, already smitten, went home only to die: some died



<P>at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the nature of



<P>the malady forbidding delay.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood,

and death



<P>its frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls;



<P>while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug



<P>and the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of



<P>mortality, that bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and



<P>beautiful woodland out of doors. Its garden, too, glowed with flowers:



<P>hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips



<P>and roses were in bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay



<P>with pink thrift and crimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out,



<P>morning and evening, their scent of spice and apples; and these



<P>fragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of Lowood,



<P>except to furnish now and then a handful of herbs and blossoms to



<P>put in a coffin.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the



<P>beauties of the scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like



<P>gipsies, from morning till night; we did what we liked, went where



<P>we liked: we lived better too. Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never



<P>came near Lowood now: household matters were not scrutinised into; the



<P>cross housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection;



<P>her successor, who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused

to



<P>the ways of her new abode, provided with comparative liberality.



<P>Besides, there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our



<P>breakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare



<P>a regular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large



<P>piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we



<P>carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose the spot we



<P>liked best, and dined sumptuously.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising

white and



<P>dry from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by



<P>wading through the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot. The stone



<P>was just broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and



<P>me, at that time my chosen comrade- one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd,



<P>observant personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly



<P>because she was witty and original, and partly because she had a



<P>manner which set me at my ease. Some years older than I, she knew more



<P>of the world, and could tell me many things I liked to hear: with



<P>her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults also she gave ample



<P>indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I said. She had



<P>a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform, I to



<P>question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much



<P>entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And where, meantime, was Helen Burns? Why did I not spend

these



<P>sweet days of liberty with her? Had I forgotten her? or was I so



<P>worthless as to have grown tired of her pure society? Surely the



<P>Mary Ann Wilson I have mentioned was inferior to my first



<P>acquaintance: she could only tell me amusing stories, and



<P>reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose to indulge in;



<P>while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified to give



<P>those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far



<P>higher things.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am

a defective



<P>being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired

of



<P>Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of



<P>attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever



<P>animated my heart. How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times



<P>and under all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful



<P>friendship, which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never



<P>troubled? But Helen was ill at present: for some weeks she had been



<P>removed from my sight to I knew not what room upstairs. She was not,

I



<P>was told, in the hospital portion of the house with the fever



<P>patients; for her complaint was consumption, not typhus: and by



<P>consumption I, in my ignorance, understood something mild, which



<P>time and care would be sure to alleviate.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or

twice



<P>coming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by



<P>Miss Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not



<P>allowed to go and speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom



<P>window, and then not distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and



<P>sat at a distance under the verandah.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out

very late



<P>with Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves



<P>from the others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way,



<P>and had to ask it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived,



<P>who looked after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the



<P>wood. When we got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew



<P>to be the surgeon's, was standing at the garden door. Mary Ann



<P>remarked that she supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had



<P>been sent for at that time of the evening. She went into the house;



<P>I stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots



<P>I had dug up in the forest, and which I feared would wither if I



<P>left them till the morning. This done, I lingered yet a little longer:



<P>the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant



<P>evening, so serene, so warm; the still glowing west promised so fairly



<P>another fine day on the morrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the



<P>grave east. I was noting these things and enjoying them as a child



<P>might, when it entered my mind as it had never done before:-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger

of



<P>dying! This world is pleasant- it would be dreary to be called from



<P>it, and to have to go who knows where?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend

what



<P>had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first



<P>time it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind,



<P>on each side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it



<P>felt the one point where it stood- the present; all the rest was



<P>formless cloud and vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of



<P>tottering, and plunging amid that chaos. While pondering this new



<P>idea, I heard the front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him



<P>was a nurse. After she had seen him mount his horse and depart, she



<P>was about to close the door, but I ran up to her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How is Helen Burns?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very poorly,' was the answer.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what does he say about her?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He says she'll not be here long.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have

only



<P>conveyed the notion that she was about to be removed to



<P>Northumberland, to her own home. I should not have suspected that it



<P>meant she was dying; but I knew instantly now! It opened clear on my



<P>comprehension that Helen Burns was numbering her last days in this



<P>world, and that she was going to be taken to the region of spirits,

if



<P>such region there were. I experienced a shock of horror, then a strong



<P>thrill of grief, then a desire- a necessity to see her; and I asked

in



<P>what room she lay.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is in Miss Temple's room,' said the nurse.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'May I go up and speak to her?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh no, child! It is not likely; and now it is time for

you to come



<P>in; you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side

entrance



<P>which led to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine



<P>o'clock, and Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when

I- not



<P>having been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence



<P>of the dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound



<P>repose- rose softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without



<P>shoes, crept from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's



<P>room. It was quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way;



<P>and the light of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there

at



<P>passage windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty. An odour

of



<P>camphor and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room:



<P>and I passed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all



<P>night should hear me. I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for



<P>I must see Helen,- I must embrace her before she died,- I must give



<P>her one last kiss, exchange with her one last word.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the

house



<P>below, and succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two



<P>doors, I reached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then



<P>just opposite to me was Miss Temple's room. A light shone through



<P>the keyhole and from under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the



<P>vicinity. Coming near, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to



<P>admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness. Indisposed to



<P>hesitate, and full of impatient impulses- soul and senses quivering



<P>with keen throes- I put it back and looked in. My eye sought Helen,



<P>and feared to find death.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white



<P>curtains, there stood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under



<P>the clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had



<P>spoken to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed



<P>candle burnt dimly on the table. Miss Temple was not to be seen: I



<P>knew afterwards that she had been called to a delirious patient in the



<P>fever-room. I advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on



<P>the curtain, but I preferred speaking before I withdrew it. I still



<P>recoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Helen!' I whispered softly, 'are you awake?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her

face,



<P>pale, wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that

my



<P>fear was instantly dissipated.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can it be you, Jane?' she asked, in her own gentle voice.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh!' I thought, 'she is not going to die; they are mistaken:

she



<P>could not speak and look so calmly if she were.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold,

and her



<P>cheek both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she



<P>smiled as of old.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why are you come here, Jane? It is past eleven o'clock:

I heard it



<P>strike some minutes since.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and

I could



<P>not sleep till I had spoken to you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time

probably.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you going somewhere, Helen? Are you going home?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; to my long home- my last home.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, no, Helen!' I stopped, distressed. While I tried to

devour



<P>my tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake



<P>the nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then



<P>she whispered-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself



<P>with my quilt.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close

to her.



<P>After a long silence, she resumed, still whispering-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead,

you



<P>must be sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about. We



<P>all must die one day, and the illness which is removing me is not



<P>painful; it is gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest. I leave no



<P>one to regret me much: I have only a father; and he is lately married,



<P>and will not miss me. By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.



<P>I had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the



<P>world: I should have been continually at fault.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But where are you going to, Helen? Can you see? Do you

know?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe; I have faith: I am going to God.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where is God? What is God?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.

I rely



<P>implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count



<P>the hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to



<P>Him, reveal Him to me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place

as heaven,



<P>and that our souls can get to it when we die?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good;

I can



<P>resign my immortal part to Him without any misgiving. God is my



<P>father; God is my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will come to the same region of happiness: be received

by



<P>the same mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I questioned, but this time only in thought. 'Where

is that



<P>region? Does it exist?' And I clasped my arms closer around Helen; she



<P>seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go;



<P>I lay with my face hidden on her neck. Presently she said, in the



<P>sweetest tone-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How comfortable I am! That last fit of coughing has tired

me a



<P>little; I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like



<P>to have you near me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll stay with you, dear Helen: no one shall take me away.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you warm, darling?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-night, Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-night, Helen.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me;

I looked



<P>up; I was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me



<P>through the passage back to the dormitory. I was not reprimanded for



<P>leaving my bed; people had something else to think about; no



<P>explanation was afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two



<P>afterwards I learned that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room

at



<P>dawn, had found me laid in the little crib; my face against Helen



<P>Burns's shoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep, and Helen was-



<P>dead.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years

after



<P>her death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble



<P>tablet marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word



<P>'Resurgam.'

CHAPTER XXXVII</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable



<P>antiquity, moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep



<P>buried in a wood. I had heard of it before. Mr. Rochester often



<P>spoke of it, and sometimes went there. His father had purchased the



<P>estate for the sake of the game covers. He would have let the house,



<P>but could find no tenant, in consequence of its ineligible and



<P>insalubrious site. Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished,



<P>with the exception of some two or three rooms fitted up for the



<P>accommodation of the squire when he went there in the season to shoot.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked

by the



<P>characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating



<P>rain. The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise



<P>and driver with the double remuneration I had promised. Even when



<P>within a very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing



<P>of it, so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about



<P>it. Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and



<P>passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of



<P>close-ranked trees. There was a grass-grown track descending the



<P>forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches.



<P>I followed it, expecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it



<P>stretched on and on, it wound far and farther: no sign of habitation



<P>or grounds was visible.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.

The



<P>darkness of natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me. I



<P>looked round in search of another road. There was none: all was



<P>interwoven stem, columnar trunk, dense summer foliage- no opening



<P>anywhere.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a

little;



<P>presently I beheld a railing, then the house- scarce, by this dim



<P>light, distinguishable from the trees, so dank and green were its



<P>decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood



<P>amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in

a



<P>semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad



<P>gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame



<P>of the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front;



<P>the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too,



<P>one step led up to it. The whole looked, as the host of the



<P>Rochester Arms had said, 'quite a desolate spot.' It was as still as

a



<P>church on a week-day: the pattering rain on the forest leaves was



<P>the only sound audible in its vicinage.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can there be life here?' I asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement-

that



<P>narrow front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue



<P>from the grange.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and

stood



<P>on the step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if

to



<P>feel whether it rained. Dusk as it was, I had recognised him- it was



<P>my master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch

him- to



<P>examine him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible. It was a



<P>sudden meeting, and one in which rapture was kept well in check by



<P>pain. I had no difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation,

my



<P>step from hasty advance.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as

ever: his



<P>port was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his



<P>features altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow,



<P>could his athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.



<P>But in his countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and



<P>brooding- that reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast



<P>or bird, dangerous to approach in his sullen woe. The caged eagle,



<P>whose gold-ringed eyes cruelty has extinguished, might look as



<P>looked that sightless Samson.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?-

if



<P>you do, you little know me. A soft hope blent with my sorrow that soon



<P>I should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips



<P>so sternly sealed beneath it: but not yet. I would not accost him yet.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly



<P>towards the grass-plat. Where was his daring stride now? Then he



<P>paused, as if he knew not which way to turn. He lifted his hand and



<P>opened his eyelids; gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the



<P>sky, and toward the amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was



<P>void darkness. He stretched his right hand (the left arm, the



<P>mutilated one, he kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by



<P>touch to gain an idea of what lay around him: he met but vacancy



<P>still; for the trees were some yards off where he stood. He



<P>relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and stood quiet and



<P>mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head. At this



<P>moment John approached him from some quarter.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will you take my arm, sir?' he said; 'there is a heavy

shower



<P>coming on: had you not better go in?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let me alone,' was the answer.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; John withdrew without having observed me. Mr. Rochester

now tried



<P>to walk about: vainly,- all was too uncertain. He groped his way



<P>back to the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.

'Mary,' I



<P>said, 'how are you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her. To

her



<P>hurried 'Is it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely



<P>place?' I answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into



<P>the kitchen, where John now sat by a good fire. I explained to them,



<P>in a few words, that I had heard all which had happened since I left



<P>Thornfield, and that I was come to see Mr. Rochester. I asked John



<P>to go down to the turnpike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise,



<P>and bring my trunk, which I had left there: and then, while I



<P>removed my bonnet and shawl, I questioned Mary as to whether I could



<P>be accommodated at the Manor House for the night; and finding that



<P>arrangements to that effect, though difficult, would not be



<P>impossible, I informed her I should stay. just at this moment the



<P>parlour-bell rang.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When you go in,' said I, 'tell your master that a person

wishes to



<P>speak to him, but do not give my name.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't think he will see you,' she answered; 'he refuses



<P>everybody.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When she returned, I inquired what he had said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are to send in your name and your business,' she replied.



<P>She then proceeded to fill a glass with water, and place it on a tray,



<P>together with candles.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is that what he rang for?' I asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though

he is



<P>blind.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Give the tray to me; I will carry it in.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour

door. The



<P>tray shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart



<P>struck my ribs loud and fast. Mary opened the door for me, and shut

it



<P>behind me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire

burnt low



<P>in the grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against



<P>the high, old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of



<P>the room. His old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way,



<P>and coiled up as if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.



<P>Pilot pricked up his ears when I came in: then he jumped up with a



<P>yelp and a whine, and bounded towards me: he almost knocked the tray



<P>from my hands. I set it on the table; then patted him, and said



<P>softly, 'Lie down!' Mr. Rochester turned mechanically to see what



<P>the commotion was: but as he saw nothing, he returned and sighed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Give me the water, Mary,' he said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot



<P>followed me, still excited.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is the matter?' he inquired.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Down, Pilot!' I again said. He checked the water on its

way to his



<P>lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down. 'This

is



<P>you, Mary, is it not?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mary is in the kitchen,' I answered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing

where I



<P>stood, he did not touch me. 'Who is this? Who is this?' he demanded,



<P>trying, as it seemed, to see with those sightless eyes- unavailing and



<P>distressing attempt! 'Answer me- speak again!' he ordered, imperiously



<P>and aloud.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will you have a little more water, sir? I spilt half of

what was



<P>in the glass,' I said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who is it? What is it? Who speaks?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here. I came

only this



<P>evening,' I answered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Great God!- what delusion has come over me? What sweet

madness has



<P>seized me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No delusion- no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong

for



<P>delusion, your health too sound for frenzy.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And where is the speaker? Is it only a voice? Oh! I cannot

see,



<P>but I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst. Whatever-



<P>whoever you are- be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned

it in both



<P>mine.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Her very fingers!' he cried; 'her small, slight fingers!

If so



<P>there must be more of her.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized,

my



<P>shoulder- neck- waist- I was entwined and gathered to him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it Jane? What is it? This is her shape- this is her

size-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And this her voice,' I added. 'She is all here: her heart,

too.



<P>God bless you, sir! I am glad to be so near you again.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane Eyre!- Jane Eyre,' was all he said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My dear master,' I answered, 'I am Jane Eyre: I have found

you



<P>out- I am come back to you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In truth?- in the flesh? My living Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You touch me, sir,- you hold me, and fast enough: I am

not cold



<P>like a corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My living darling! These are certainly her limbs, and

these her



<P>features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery. It is a



<P>dream; such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once



<P>more to my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus- and felt



<P>that she loved me, and trusted that she would not leave me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Which I never will, sir, from this day.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never will, says the vision? But I always woke and found

it an



<P>empty mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned- my life dark, lonely,



<P>hopeless- my soul athirst and forbidden to drink- my heart famished



<P>and never to be fed. Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now,



<P>you will fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but



<P>kiss me before you go- embrace me, Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There, sir- and there!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless

eyes- I



<P>swept his hair from his brow, and kissed that too. He suddenly



<P>seemed to arouse himself: the conviction of the reality of all this



<P>seized him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is you- is it, Jane? You are come back to me then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?

And you



<P>are not a pining outcast amongst strangers?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir! I am an independent woman now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Independent! What do you mean, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand

pounds.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! this is practical- this is real!' he cried: 'I should

never



<P>dream that. Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so



<P>animating and piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart;



<P>it puts life into it.- What, Janet! Are you an independent woman? A



<P>rich woman?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Quite rich, sir. If you won't let me live with you, I

can build



<P>a house of my own close up to your door, and you may come and sit in



<P>my parlour when you want company of an evening.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends

who



<P>will look after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a



<P>blind lameter like me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am

my own



<P>mistress.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you will stay with me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Certainly- unless you object. I will be your neighbour,

your



<P>nurse, your housekeeper. I find you lonely: I will be your



<P>companion- to read to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to



<P>wait on you, to be eyes and hands to you. Cease to look so melancholy,



<P>my dear master; you shall not be left desolate, so long as I live.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He replied not: he seemed serious- abstracted; he sighed;

he



<P>half-opened his lips as if to speak: he closed them again. I felt a



<P>little embarrassed. Perhaps I had too rashly overleaped



<P>conventionalities; and he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my



<P>inconsiderateness. I had indeed made my proposal from the idea that

he



<P>wished and would ask me to be his wife: an expectation, not the less



<P>certain because unexpressed, had buoyed me up, that he would claim



<P>me at once as his own. But no hint to that effect escaping him and his



<P>countenance becoming more overcast, I suddenly remembered that I might



<P>have been all wrong, and was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and



<P>I began gently to withdraw myself from his arms- but he eagerly



<P>snatched me closer.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No- no- Jane; you must not go. No- I have touched you,

heard



<P>you, felt the comfort of your presence- the sweetness of your



<P>consolation: I cannot give up these joys. I have little left in



<P>myself- I must have you. The world may laugh- may call me absurd,



<P>selfish- but it does not signify. My very soul demands you: it will

be



<P>satisfied, or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes- but you understand one thing by staying with me;

and I



<P>understand another. You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be



<P>about my hand and chair- to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you



<P>have an affectionate heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you



<P>to make sacrifices for those you pity), and that ought to suffice



<P>for me no doubt. I suppose I should now entertain none but fatherly



<P>feelings for you: do you think so? Come- tell me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only

your



<P>nurse, if you think it better.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young-

you



<P>must marry one day.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't care about being married.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would

try



<P>to make you care- but- a sightless block!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He relapsed again into gloom. I, on the contrary, became

more



<P>cheerful, and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an



<P>insight as to where the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty



<P>with me, I felt quite relieved from my previous embarrassment. I



<P>resumed a livelier vein of conversation.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you,' said

I,



<P>parting his thick and long uncut locks; 'for I see you are being



<P>metamorphosed into a lion, or something of that sort. You have a "faux



<P>air" of Nebuchadnezzar in the fields about you, that is certain:



<P>your hair reminds me of eagles' feathers; whether your nails are grown



<P>like birds' claws or not, I have not yet noticed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails,' he said,

drawing



<P>the mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me. 'It is a



<P>mere stump- a ghastly sight! Don't you think so, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes- and

the



<P>scar of fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in



<P>danger of loving you too well for all this; and making too much of



<P>you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my

arm, and my



<P>cicatrised visage.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you? Don't tell me so- lest I should say something

disparaging



<P>to your judgment. Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better



<P>fire, and have the hearth swept up. Can you tell when there is a



<P>good fire?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; with the right eye I see a glow- a ruddy haze.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you see the candles?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very dimly- each is a luminous cloud.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can you see me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel

you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When do you take supper?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I never take supper.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you shall have some to-night. I am hungry: so are

you, I



<P>daresay, only you forget.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order:

I



<P>prepared him, likewise, a comfortable repast. My spirits were excited,



<P>and with pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a



<P>long time after. There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of



<P>glee and vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease,



<P>because I knew I suited him; all I said or did seemed either to



<P>console or revive him. Delightful consciousness! It brought to life



<P>and light my whole nature: in his presence I thoroughly lived; and



<P>he lived in mine. Blind as he was, smiles played over his face, joy



<P>dawned on his forehead: his lineaments softened and warmed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where

I had



<P>been, what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him



<P>only very partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars



<P>that night. Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord- to



<P>open no fresh well of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was

to



<P>cheer him. Cheered, as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits. If



<P>a moment's silence broke the conversation, he would turn restless,



<P>touch me, then say, 'Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are altogether a human being, Janet? You are certain

of that?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so

suddenly



<P>rise on my lone hearth? I stretched my hand to take a glass of water



<P>from a hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question,



<P>expecting John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending

with



<P>you. Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged

on



<P>for months past? Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in



<P>day; feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out,



<P>of hunger when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at



<P>times, a very delirium of desire to behold my Jane again. Yes: for her



<P>restoration I longed, far more than for that of my lost sight. How can



<P>it be that Jane is with me, and says she loves me? Will she not depart



<P>as suddenly as she came? To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his

own



<P>disturbed ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him



<P>in this frame of mind. I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and



<P>remarked that they were scorched, and that I would apply something



<P>which would make them grow as broad and black as ever.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent

spirit,



<P>when, at some fatal moment, you will again desert me- passing like a



<P>shadow, whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards



<P>undiscoverable?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What for, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just to comb out this shaggy black mane. I find you rather



<P>alarming, when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a



<P>fairy, but I am sure, you are more like a brownie.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Am I hideous, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very, sir: you always were, you know.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Humph! The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever



<P>you have sojourned.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet I have been with good people; far better than you:

a hundred



<P>times better people; possessed of ideas and views you never



<P>entertained in your life: quite more refined and exalted.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who the deuce have you been with?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair

out of



<P>your head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my



<P>substantiality.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who have you been with, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must

wait till



<P>to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of



<P>security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.



<P>By the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass



<P>of water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of



<P>fried ham.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You mocking changeling- fairy-born and human-bred! You

make me



<P>feel as I have not felt these twelve months. If Saul could have had



<P>you for his David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without



<P>the aid of the harp.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There, sir, you are redd up and made decent. Now I'll

leave you: I



<P>have been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am



<P>tired. Good night.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house

where you



<P>have been?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.



<P>'A good idea!' I thought with glee. 'I see I have the means of



<P>fretting him out of his melancholy for some time to come.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering



<P>from one room to another. As soon as Mary came down I heard the



<P>question: 'Is Miss Eyre here?' Then: 'Which room did you put her into?



<P>Was it dry? Is she up? Go and ask if she wants anything; and when



<P>she will come down.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of

breakfast.



<P>Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he



<P>discovered my presence. It was mournful, indeed, to witness the



<P>subjugation of that vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity. He sat



<P>in his chair- still, but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines



<P>of now habitual sadness marking his strong features. His countenance



<P>reminded one of a lamp quenched, waiting to be re-lit- and alas! it



<P>was not himself that could now kindle the lustre of animated



<P>expression: he was dependent on another for that office! I had meant



<P>to be gay and careless, but the powerlessness of the strong man



<P>touched my heart to the quick: still I accosted him with what vivacity



<P>I could.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a bright, sunny morning, sir,' I said. 'The rain

is over and



<P>gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk



<P>soon.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark! Come to me. You

are not



<P>gone: not vanished? I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high



<P>over the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the



<P>rising sun had rays. All the melody on earth is concentrated in my



<P>Jane's tongue to my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent



<P>one): all the sunshine I can feel is in her presence.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence;



<P>just as if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to



<P>entreat a sparrow to become its purveyor. But I would not be



<P>lachrymose: I dashed off the salt drops, and busied myself with



<P>preparing breakfast.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the morning was spent in the open air. I led him

out of the



<P>wet and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how



<P>brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked



<P>refreshed; how sparklingly blue was the sky. I sought a seat for him



<P>in a hidden and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse



<P>to let him, when seated, place me on his knee. Why should I, when both



<P>he and I were happier near than apart? Pilot lay beside us: all was



<P>quiet. He broke out suddenly while clasping me in his arms-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cruel, cruel deserter! Oh, Jane, what did I feel when

I discovered



<P>you had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you;



<P>and, after examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken

no



<P>money, nor anything which could serve as an equivalent! A pearl



<P>necklace I had given you lay untouched in its little casket; your



<P>trunks were left corded and locked as they had been prepared for the



<P>bridal tour. What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and



<P>penniless? And what did she do? Let me hear now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for

the last



<P>year. I softened considerably what related to the three days of



<P>wandering and starvation, because to have told him all would have been



<P>to inflict unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his



<P>faithful heart deeper than I wished.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means

of



<P>making my way: I should have told him my intention. I should have



<P>confided in him: he would never have forced me to be his mistress.



<P>Violent as he had seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far



<P>too well and too tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would



<P>have given me half his fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss

in



<P>return, rather than I should have flung myself friendless on the



<P>wide world. I had endured, he was certain, more than I had confessed



<P>to him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very

short,' I



<P>answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received



<P>at Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, etc.



<P>The accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in



<P>due order. Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in



<P>the progress of my tale. When I had done, that name was immediately



<P>taken up.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This St. John, then, is your cousin?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have spoken of him often: do you like him?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A good man. Does that mean a respectable well-conducted

man of



<P>fifty? Or what does it mean?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John was only twenty-nine, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"Jeune encore," as the French say. Is he a person of low



<P>stature, phlegmatic, and plain? A person whose goodness consists



<P>rather in his guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is untiringly active. Great and exalted deeds are what

he lives



<P>to perform.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But his brain? That is probably rather soft? He means

well: but



<P>you shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the

point. His



<P>brain is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is he an able man, then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Truly able.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A thoroughly educated man?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?-

priggish



<P>and parsonic?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very

bad taste,



<P>they must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'His appearance,- I forget what description you gave of

his



<P>appearance;- a sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white



<P>neckcloth, and stilted up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair,

with blue



<P>eyes, and a Grecian profile.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (Aside.) 'Damn him!'- (To me.) 'Did you like him, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that

before.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor. Jealousy



<P>had got hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it



<P>gave him respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy. I would not,



<P>therefore, immediately charm the snake.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee,

Miss



<P>Eyre?' was the next somewhat unexpected observation.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why not, Mr. Rochester?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather

too



<P>overwhelming contrast. Your words have delineated very prettily a



<P>graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,- tall, fair,



<P>blue-eyed, and with a Grecian profile. Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,-

a



<P>real blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into



<P>the bargain.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather

like



<P>Vulcan, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go' (and

he



<P>retained me by a firmer grasp than ever), 'you will be pleased just

to



<P>answer me a question or two.' He paused.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What questions, Mr. Rochester?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then followed this cross-examination.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew

you were



<P>his cousin?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You would often see him? He would visit the school sometimes?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Daily.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He would approve of your plans, Jane? I know they would

be clever,



<P>for you are a talented creature!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He approved of them- yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He would discover many things in you he could not have

expected to



<P>find? Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't know about that.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did

he ever



<P>come there to see you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now and then.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of an evening?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Once or twice.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A pause.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How long did you reside with him and his sisters after

the



<P>cousinship was discovered?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Five months.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he

sat near the



<P>window, and we by the table.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did he study much?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A good deal.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hindostanee.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what did you do meantime?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I learnt German, at first.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did he teach you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He did not understand German.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did he teach you nothing?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A little Hindostanee.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Rivers taught you Hindostanee?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And his sisters also?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you ask to learn?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He wished to teach you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A second pause.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why did he wish it? Of what use could Hindostanee be to

you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He intended me to go with him to India.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! here I reach the root of the matter. He wanted you

to marry



<P>him?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He asked me to marry him.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is a fiction- an impudent invention to vex me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me

more



<P>than once, and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could



<P>be.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me. How often am

I to say



<P>the same thing? Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee,



<P>when I have given you notice to quit?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because I am comfortable there.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your

heart is not



<P>with me: it is with this cousin- this St. John. Oh, till this



<P>moment, I thought my little Jane was all mine! I had a belief she



<P>loved me even when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much



<P>bitter. Long as we have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our



<P>separation, I never thought that while I was mourning her, she was



<P>loving another! But it is useless grieving. Jane, leave me: go and



<P>marry Rivers.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shake me off, then, sir,- push me away, for I'll not leave

you



<P>of my own accord.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews

hope, it



<P>sounds so truthful. When I hear it, it carries me back a year. I



<P>forget that you have formed a new tie. But I am not a fool-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where must I go, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your own way- with the husband you have chosen.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who is that?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You know- this St. John Rivers.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is not my husband, nor ever will be. He does not love

me: I



<P>do not love him. He loves (as he can love, and that is not as you



<P>love) a beautiful young lady called Rosamond. He wanted to marry me



<P>only because he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife,



<P>which she would not have done. He is good and great, but severe;



<P>and, for me, cold as an iceberg. He is not like you, sir: I am not



<P>happy at his side, nor near him, nor with him. He has no indulgence



<P>for me- no fondness. He sees nothing attractive in me; not even youth-



<P>only a few useful mental points- Then I must leave you, sir, to go



<P>to him?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer

to my



<P>blind but beloved master. He smiled.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What, Jane! Is this true? Is such really the state of

matters



<P>between you and Rivers?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Absolutely, sir! Oh, you need not be jealous! I wanted

to tease



<P>you a little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better



<P>than grief. But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much



<P>I do love you, you would be proud and content. All my heart is



<P>yours, sir: it belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate



<P>to exile the rest of me from your presence for ever.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My seared vision! My crippled strength!' he murmured regretfully.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I caressed, in order to soothe him. I knew of what he was

thinking,



<P>and wanted to speak for him, but dared not. As he turned aside his



<P>face a minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and



<P>trickle down the manly cheek. My heart swelled.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree

in



<P>Thornfield orchard,' he remarked ere long. 'And what right would



<P>that ruin have to bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with



<P>freshness?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are no ruin, sir- no lightning-struck tree: you are

green



<P>and vigorous. Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask



<P>them or not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and



<P>as they grow they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because



<P>your strength offers them so safe a prop.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You speak of friends, Jane?' he asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, of friends,' I answered rather hesitatingly: for

I knew I



<P>meant more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.



<P>He helped me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! Jane. But I want a wife.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes: is it news to you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course: you said nothing about it before.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it unwelcome news?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That depends on circumstances, sir- on your choice.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Which you shall make for me, Jane. I will abide by your

decision.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Choose then, sir- her who loves you best.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will at least choose- her I love best. Jane, will you

marry me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by

the hand?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you

will have to



<P>wait on?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Truly, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Most truly, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! my darling! God bless you and reward you!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life- if

ever I



<P>thought a good thought- if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless



<P>prayer- if ever I wished a righteous wish,- I am rewarded now. To be



<P>your wife is, for me, to be as happy as I can be on earth.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because you delight in sacrifice.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sacrifice! What do I sacrifice? Famine for food, expectation

for



<P>content. To be privileged to put my arms round what I value- to



<P>press my lips to what I love- to repose on what I trust: is that to



<P>make a sacrifice? If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my



<P>deficiencies.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Which are none, sir, to me. I love you better now, when

I can



<P>really be useful to you, than I did in your state of proud



<P>independence, when you disdained every part but that of the giver



<P>and protector.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hitherto I have hated to be helped- to be led: henceforth,

I



<P>feel I shall hate it no more. I did not like to put my hand into a



<P>hireling's, but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little



<P>fingers. I preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of



<P>servants; but Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy. Jane suits



<P>me: do I suit her?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To the finest fibre of my nature, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait

for: we



<P>must be married instantly.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity

was rising.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there

is but the



<P>licence to get- then we marry.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined

from



<P>its meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner. Let me



<P>look at your watch.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward:

I



<P>have no use for it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir. Don't

you feel



<P>hungry?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.

Never



<P>mind fine clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir. The breeze

is still:



<P>it is quite hot.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at

this



<P>moment fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat? I have worn



<P>it since the day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest

way.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but

my heart



<P>swells with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.

He



<P>sees not as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but



<P>far more wisely. I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower-



<P>breathed guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me. I,



<P>in my stiff-necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation:



<P>instead of bending to the decree, I defied it. Divine justice



<P>pursued its course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass



<P>through the valley of the shadow of death. His chastisements are



<P>mighty; and one smote me which has humbled me for ever. You know I was



<P>proud of my strength: but what is it now, when I must give it over



<P>to foreign guidance, as a child does its weakness? Of late, Jane-



<P>only- only of late- I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God



<P>in my doom. I began to experience remorse, repentance; the wish for



<P>reconcilement to my Maker. I began sometimes to pray: very brief



<P>prayers they were, but very sincere.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Some days since: nay, I can number them- four; it was

last



<P>Monday night, a singular mood came over me: one in which grief



<P>replaced frenzy- sorrow, sullenness. I had long had the impression



<P>that since I could nowhere find you, you must be dead. Late that



<P>night- perhaps it might be between eleven and twelve o'clock- ere I



<P>retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated God, that, if it seemed



<P>good to Him, I might soon be taken from this life, and admitted to



<P>that world to come, where there was still hope of rejoining Jane.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which

was open:



<P>it soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no



<P>stars, and only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a



<P>moon. I longed for thee, Janet! Oh, I longed for thee both with soul



<P>and flesh! I asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had



<P>not been long enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not



<P>soon taste bliss and peace once more. That I merited all I endured,



<P>I acknowledged- that I could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and



<P>the alpha and omega of my heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my



<P>lips in the words- "Jane! Jane! Jane!"'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you speak these words aloud?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I did, Jane. If any listener had heard me, he would have

thought



<P>me mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed

is the



<P>strange point. You will think me superstitious- some superstition I



<P>have in my blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true- true



<P>at least it is that I heard what I now relate.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'As I exclaimed "Jane! Jane! Jane!" a voice- I cannot tell

whence



<P>the voice came, but I know whose voice it was- replied, "I am



<P>coming: wait for me;" and a moment after, went whispering on the



<P>wind the words- "Where are you?"



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words



<P>opened to my mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to



<P>express. Ferndean is buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where



<P>sound falls dull, and dies unreverberating. "Where are you?" seemed



<P>spoken amongst mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the



<P>words. Cooler and fresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit my



<P>brow: I could have deemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and Jane



<P>were meeting. In spirit, I believe we must have met. You no doubt



<P>were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps your soul



<P>wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were your accents-



<P>as certain as I live- they were yours!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reader, it was on Monday night- near midnight- that I too

had



<P>received the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which



<P>I replied to it. I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made



<P>no disclosure in return. The coincidence struck me as too awful and



<P>inexplicable to be communicated or discussed. If I told anything, my



<P>tale would be such as must necessarily make a profound impression on



<P>the mind of my hearer: and that mind, yet from its sufferings too



<P>prone to gloom, needed not the deeper shade of the supernatural. I



<P>kept these things then, and pondered them in my heart.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You cannot now wonder,' continued my master, 'that when

you rose



<P>upon me so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing



<P>you any other than a mere voice and vision, something that would



<P>melt to silence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain



<P>echo had melted before. Now, I thank God! I know it to be otherwise.



<P>Yes, I thank God!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his

hat from



<P>his brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in



<P>mute devotion. Only the last words of the worship were audible.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has



<P>remembered mercy. I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength



<P>to lead henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he stretched his hand out to be led. I took that dear

hand,



<P>held it a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being



<P>so much lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and



<P>guide. We entered the wood, and wended homeward.

CHAPTER XXIII</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A SPLENDID Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure,

suns so



<P>radiant as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even



<P>singly, our wave-girt land. It was as if a band of Italian days had



<P>come from the South, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and



<P>lighted to rest them on the cliffs of Albion. The hay was all got



<P>in; the fields round Thornfield were green and shorn; the roads



<P>white and baked; the trees were in their dark prime; hedge and wood,



<P>full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue of



<P>the cleared meadows between.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries



<P>in Hay Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun. I watched



<P>her drop asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:- 'Day

its fervid



<P>fires had wasted,' and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched



<P>summit. Where the sun had gone down in simple state- pure of the



<P>pomp of clouds- spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of



<P>red jewel and furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and



<P>extending high and wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.



<P>The east had its own charm of fine deep blue, and its own modest



<P>gem, a rising and solitary star: soon it would boast the moon; but she



<P>was yet beneath the horizon.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known

scent-



<P>that of a cigar- stole from some window; I saw the library casement



<P>open a hand-breadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart



<P>into the orchard. No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more



<P>Eden-like; it was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very



<P>high wall shut it out from the court, on one side; on the other, a



<P>beech avenue screened it from the lawn. At the bottom was a sunk



<P>fence; its sole separation from lonely fields: a winding walk,



<P>bordered with laurels and terminating in a giant horse-chestnut,



<P>circled at the base by a seat, led down to the fence. Here one could



<P>wander unseen. While such honey-dew fell, such silence reigned, such



<P>gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such shade for ever; but



<P>in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the upper part of the



<P>enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising moon cast on this



<P>more open quarter, my step is stayed-not by sound, not by sight, but



<P>once more by a warning fragrance.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have

long



<P>been yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is



<P>neither of shrub nor flower; it is- I know it well- it is Mr.



<P>Rochester's cigar. I look round and I listen. I see trees laden with



<P>ripening fruit. I hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile



<P>off; no moving form is visible, no coming step audible; but that



<P>perfume increases: I must flee. I make for the wicket leading to the



<P>shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester entering. I step aside into the ivy



<P>recess; he will not stay long: he will soon return whence he came, and



<P>if I sit still he will never see me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But no- eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this

antique



<P>garden as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the



<P>gooseberry-tree branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with



<P>which they are laden; now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now



<P>stooping towards a knot of flowers, either to inhale their fragrance



<P>or to admire the dew-beads on their petals. A great moth goes



<P>humming by me; it alights on a plant at Mr. Rochester's foot: he



<P>sees it, and bends to examine it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, he has his back towards me,' thought I, 'and he is

occupied



<P>too; perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly



<P>gravel might not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard



<P>or two distant from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged



<P>him. 'I shall get by very well,' I meditated. As I crossed his shadow,



<P>thrown long over the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said



<P>quietly, without turning-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, come and look at this fellow.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind- could his

shadow feel?



<P>I started at first, and then I approached him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Look at his wings,' said he, 'he reminds me rather of

a West



<P>Indian insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover



<P>in England; there! he is flown.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The moth roamed away. I was sheepishly retreating also;

but Mr.



<P>Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in

the house;



<P>and surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at



<P>meeting with moonrise.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes

prompt



<P>enough at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing



<P>an excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile



<P>word or plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful



<P>embarrassment. I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.



<P>Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to



<P>allege for leaving him. I followed with lagging step, and thoughts



<P>busily bent on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself



<P>looked so composed and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling



<P>any confusion: the evil- if evil existent or prospective there was-



<P>seemed to lie with me only; his mind was unconscious and quiet.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane,' he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk,

and slowly



<P>strayed down in the direction of the sunk fence and the



<P>horse-chestnut, 'Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You must have become in some degree attached to the house,-

you,



<P>who have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ



<P>of Adhesiveness?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am attached to it, indeed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you

have



<P>acquired a degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele,



<P>too; and even for simple dame Fairfax?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And would be sorry to part with them?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pity!' he said, and sighed and paused. 'It is always the

way of



<P>events in this life,' he continued presently: 'no sooner have you



<P>got settled in a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you



<P>to rise and move on, for the hour of repose is expired.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Must I move on, sir?' I asked. 'Must I leave Thornfield?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe you must, Jane. I am sorry, Janet, but I believe



<P>indeed you must.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is come now- I must give it to-night.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you are going to be married, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ex-act-ly- pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you

have hit



<P>the nail straight on the head.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Soon, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very soon, my- that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember,

Jane,



<P>the first time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my



<P>intention to put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to



<P>enter into the holy estate of matrimony- to take Miss Ingram to my



<P>bosom, in short (she's an extensive armful: but that's not to the



<P>point- one can't have too much of such a very excellent thing as my



<P>beautiful Blanche): well, as I was saying- listen to me, Jane!



<P>You're not turning your head to look after more moths, are you? That



<P>was only a lady-clock, child, "flying away home." I wish to remind you



<P>that it was you who first said to me, with that discretion I respect



<P>in you- with that foresight, prudence, and humility which befit your



<P>responsible and dependent position- that in case I married Miss



<P>Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot forthwith. I pass



<P>over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the character



<P>of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll try to



<P>forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I have



<P>made it my law of action. Adele must go to school; and you, Miss Eyre,



<P>must get a new situation.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime,

I



<P>suppose-' I was going to say, 'I suppose I may stay here, till I



<P>find another shelter to betake myself to': but I stopped, feeling it



<P>would not do to risk a long sentence, for my voice was not quite under



<P>command.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom,' continued

Mr.



<P>Rochester; 'and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment



<P>and an asylum for you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, no need to apologise! I consider that when a dependant

does



<P>her duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim



<P>upon her employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render



<P>her; indeed I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard



<P>of a place that I think will suit: it is to undertake the education

of



<P>the five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge,



<P>Connaught, Ireland. You'll like Ireland, I think: they're such



<P>warmhearted people there, they say.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a long way off, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No matter- a girl of your sense will not object to the

voyage or



<P>the distance.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is

a barrier-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'From what, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'From England and from Thornfield: and-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'From you, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction

of



<P>free will, my tears gushed out. I did not cry so as to be heard,



<P>however; I avoided sobbing. The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and



<P>Bitternutt Lodge struck cold to my heart; and colder the thought of



<P>all the brine and foam, destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and



<P>the master at whose side I now walked, and coldest the remembrance



<P>of the wider ocean- wealth, caste, custom intervened between me and



<P>what I naturally and inevitably loved.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a long way,' I again said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge,



<P>Connaught, Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's



<P>morally certain. I never go over to Ireland, not having myself much

of



<P>a fancy for the country. We have been good friends, Jane; have we



<P>not?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like

to



<P>spend the little time that remains to them close to each other.



<P>Come! we'll talk over the voyage and the parting quietly half an



<P>hour or so, while the stars enter into their shining life up in heaven



<P>yonder: here is the chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.



<P>Come, we will sit there in peace to-night, though we should never more



<P>be destined to sit there together.' He seated me and himself.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to

send my



<P>little friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how



<P>is it to be helped? Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was

still.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because,' he said, 'I sometimes have a queer feeling with

regard



<P>to you- especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a



<P>string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably



<P>knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of



<P>your little frame. And if that boisterous Channel and two hundred



<P>miles or so of land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of



<P>communion will be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should



<P>take to bleeding inwardly. As for you,- you'd forget me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That I never should, sir: you know-' Impossible to proceed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?

Listen!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress

what I



<P>endured no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from



<P>head to foot with acute distress. When I did speak, it was only to



<P>express an impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come

to



<P>Thornfield.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because you are sorry to leave it?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within

me,



<P>was claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a



<P>right to predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last:



<P>yes,- and to speak.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:- I love

it,



<P>because I have lived in it a full and delightful life,- momentarily

at



<P>least. I have not been trampled on. I have not been petrified. I



<P>have not been buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every



<P>glimpse of communion with what is bright and energetic and high. I



<P>have talked, face to face, with what I reverence, with what I



<P>delight in,- with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind. I have



<P>known you, Mr. Rochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish

to



<P>feel I absolutely must be torn from you for ever. I see the



<P>necessity of departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of



<P>death.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where do you see the necessity?' he asked suddenly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where? You, sir, have placed it before me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In what shape?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,-

your



<P>bride.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My bride! What bride? I have no bride!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you will have.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes;- I will!'- I will!' He set his teeth.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then I must go:- you have said it yourself.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No: you must stay! I swear it- and the oath shall be kept.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I tell you I must go!' I retorted, roused to something

like



<P>passion. 'Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you



<P>think I am an automaton?- a machine without feelings? and can bear



<P>to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of



<P>living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor,



<P>obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think



<P>wrong!- I have as much soul as you,- and full as much heart! And if



<P>God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made



<P>it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I

am



<P>not talking to you now through the medium of custom,



<P>conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;- it is my spirit that



<P>addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave,



<P>and we stood at God's feet, equal,- as we are!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'As we are!' repeated Mr. Rochester- 'so,' he added, enclosing

me



<P>in his arms, gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips:



<P>'so, Jane!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, so, sir,' I rejoined: 'and yet not so; for you are

a



<P>married man- or as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to



<P>you- to one with whom you have no sympathy- whom I do not believe



<P>you truly love; for I have seen and heard you sneer at her. I would



<P>scorn such a union: therefore I am better than you- let me go!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where, Jane? To Ireland?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes- to Ireland. I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere

now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic

bird that



<P>is rending its own plumage in its desperation.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human

being with



<P>an independent will, which I now exert to leave you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before

him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And your will shall decide your destiny,' he said: 'I

offer you my



<P>hand, my heart, and a share of all my possessions.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You play a farce, which I merely laugh at.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I ask you to pass through life at my side- to be my second

self,



<P>and best earthly companion.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For that fate you have already made your choice, and must

abide by



<P>it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I

will be



<P>still too.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk and trembled



<P>through the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away- away- to an



<P>indefinite distance- it died. The nightingale's song was then the only



<P>voice of the hour: in listening to it, I again wept. Mr. Rochester sat



<P>quiet, looking at me gently and seriously. Some time passed before



<P>he spoke; he at last said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand

one



<P>another.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now,

and



<P>cannot return.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend

to



<P>marry.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was silent: I thought he mocked me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come, Jane- come hither.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your bride stands between us.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He rose, and with a stride reached me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My bride is here,' he said, again drawing me to him, 'because

my



<P>equal is here, and my likeness. Jane, will you marry me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from

his



<P>grasp: for I was still incredulous.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you doubt me, Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Entirely.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have no faith in me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not a whit.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Am I a liar in your eyes?' he asked passionately. 'Little

sceptic,



<P>you shall be convinced. What love have I for Miss Ingram? None: and



<P>that you know. What love has she for me? None: as I have taken pains



<P>to prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a



<P>third of what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see



<P>the result; it was coldness both from her and her mother. I would not-



<P>I could not- marry Miss Ingram. You- you strange, you almost unearthly



<P>thing!- I love as my own flesh. You- poor and obscure, and small and



<P>plain as you are- I entreat to accept me as a husband.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What, me!' I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness-

and



<P>especially in his incivility- to credit his sincerity: 'me who have



<P>not a friend in the world but you- if you are my friend: not a



<P>shilling but what you have given me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You, Jane, I must have you for my own- entirely my own.

Will you



<P>be mine? Say yes, quickly.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because I want to read your countenance- turn!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled,



<P>scratched page. Read on: only make haste, for I suffer.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; His face was very much agitated and very much flushed,

and there



<P>were strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, Jane, you torture me!' he exclaimed. 'With that searching



<P>and yet faithful and generous look, you torture me!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How can I do that? If you are true, and your offer real,

my only



<P>feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion- they cannot torture.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Gratitude!' he ejaculated; and added wildly- 'Jane, accept

me



<P>quickly. Say, Edward- give me my name- Edward- I will marry you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you in earnest? Do you truly love me? Do you sincerely

wish me



<P>to be your wife?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear

it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, sir, I will marry you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Edward- my little wife!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dear Edward!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come to me- come to me entirely now,' said he; and added,

in his



<P>deepest tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine,



<P>'Make my happiness- I will make yours.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'God pardon me!' he subjoined ere long; 'and man meddle

not with



<P>me: I have her, and will hold her.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There is no one to meddle, sir. I have no kindred to interfere.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No- that is the best of it,' he said. And if I had loved

him



<P>less I should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage;



<P>but, sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting- called to



<P>the paradise of union- I thought only of the bliss given me to drink



<P>in so abundant a flow. Again and again he said, 'Are you happy, Jane?'



<P>And again and again I answered, 'Yes,' After which he murmured, 'It



<P>will atone- it will atone. Have I not found her friendless, and



<P>cold, and comfortless? Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace



<P>her? Is there not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves? It



<P>will expiate at God's tribunal. I know my Maker sanctions what I do.



<P>For the world's judgment- I wash my hands thereof. For man's



<P>opinion- I defy it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But what had befallen the night? The moon was not yet set,

and we



<P>were all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I



<P>was. And what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while



<P>wind roared in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We must go in,' said Mr. Rochester: 'the weather changes.

I



<P>could have sat with thee till morning, Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And so,' thought I, 'could I with you.' I should have

said so,



<P>perhaps, but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I



<P>was looking, and there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling



<P>peal; and I thought only of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr.



<P>Rochester's shoulder.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The rain rushed down. He hurried me up the walk, through

the



<P>grounds, and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could



<P>pass the threshold. He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and



<P>shaking the water out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged



<P>from her room. I did not observe her at first, nor did Mr.



<P>Rochester. The lamp was lit. The dock was on the stroke of twelve.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hasten to take off your wet things,' said he; 'and before

you



<P>go, good-night- good-night, my darling!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He kissed me repeatedly. When I looked up, on leaving his

arms,



<P>there stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed. I only smiled at



<P>her, and ran upstairs. 'Explanation will do for another time,' thought



<P>I. Still, when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she



<P>should even temporarily misconstrue what she had seen. But joy soon



<P>effaced every other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and



<P>deep as the thunder crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning



<P>gleamed, cataract-like as the rain fell during a storm of two hours'



<P>duration, I experienced no fear and little awe. Mr. Rochester came



<P>thrice to my door in the course of it, to ask if I was safe and



<P>tranquil: and that was comfort, that was strength for anything.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came

running in



<P>to tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the



<P>orchard had been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it



<P>split away.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. ROCHESTER had given me but one week's leave of absence:

yet a



<P>month elapsed before I quitted Gateshead. I wished to leave



<P>immediately after the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till



<P>she could get off to London, whither she was now at last invited by



<P>her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who had come down to direct his sister's



<P>interment and settle the family affairs. Georgiana said she dreaded



<P>being left alone with Eliza; from her she got neither sympathy in



<P>her dejection, support in her fears, nor aid in her preparations; so

I



<P>bore with her feeble-minded wailings and selfish lamentations as



<P>well as I could, and did my best in sewing for her and packing her



<P>dresses. It is true, that while I worked, she would idle; and I



<P>thought to myself, 'If you and I were destined to live always



<P>together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.



<P>I should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I



<P>should assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish



<P>it, or else it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your



<P>keeping some of those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in



<P>your own breast. It is only because our connection happens to be



<P>very transitory, and comes at a peculiarly mournful season, that I



<P>consent thus to render it so patient and compliant on my part.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn

to request



<P>me to stay another week. Her plans required all her time and



<P>attention, she said; she was about to depart for some unknown



<P>bourne; and all day long she stayed in her own room, her door bolted



<P>within, filling trunks, emptying drawers, burning papers, and



<P>holding no communication with any one. She wished me to look after the



<P>house, to see callers, and answer notes of condolence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning she told me I was at liberty. 'And,' she added,

'I am



<P>obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!



<P>There is some difference between living with such an one as you and



<P>with Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.



<P>To-morrow,' she continued, 'I set out for the Continent. I shall



<P>take up my abode in a religious house near Lisle- a nunnery you



<P>would call it; there I shall be quiet and unmolested. I shall devote



<P>myself for a time to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and



<P>to a careful study of the workings of their system: if I find it to



<P>be, as I half suspect it is, the one best calculated to ensure the



<P>doing of all things decently and in order, I shall embrace the



<P>tenets of Rome and probably take the veil.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted

to



<P>dissuade her from it. 'The vocation will fit you to a hair,' I



<P>thought: 'much good may it do you!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When we parted, she said: 'Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre;

I wish you



<P>well: you have some sense.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I then returned: 'You are not without sense, cousin Eliza;

but what



<P>you have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a



<P>French convent. However, it is not my business, and so it suits you,

I



<P>don't much care.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are in the right,' said she; and with these words

we each went



<P>our separate way. As I shall not have occasion to refer either to



<P>her or her sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana



<P>made an advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and



<P>that Eliza actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of



<P>the convent where she passed the period of her novitiate, and which



<P>she endowed with her fortune.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; How people feel when they are returning home from an absence,



<P>long or short, I did not know: I had never experienced the



<P>sensation. I had known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a



<P>child after a long walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and



<P>later, what it was to come back from church to Lowood, to long for a



<P>plenteous meal and a good fire, and to be unable to get either.



<P>Neither of these returnings was very pleasant or desirable: no



<P>magnet drew me to a given point, increasing in its strength of



<P>attraction the nearer I came. The return to Thornfield was yet to be



<P>tried.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My journey seemed tedious- very tedious: fifty miles one

day, a



<P>night spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day. During the first



<P>twelve hours I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her



<P>disfigured and discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered



<P>voice. I mused on the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black



<P>train of tenants and servants- few was the number of relatives- the



<P>gaping vault, the silent church, the solemn service. Then I thought

of



<P>Eliza and Georgiana; I beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the



<P>other the inmate of a convent cell; and I dwelt on and analysed



<P>their separate peculiarities of person and character. The evening



<P>gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's bed, I



<P>left reminiscence for anticipation.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay

there?



<P>Not long; of that I was sure. I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the



<P>interim of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr.



<P>Rochester had left for London three weeks ago, but he was then



<P>expected to return in a fortnight. Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was



<P>gone to make arrangements for his wedding, as he had talked of



<P>purchasing a new carriage: she said the idea of his marrying Miss



<P>Ingram still seemed strange to her; but from what everybody said,



<P>and from what she had herself seen, she could no longer doubt that the



<P>event would shortly take place. 'You would be strangely incredulous

if



<P>you did doubt it,' was my mental comment. 'I don't doubt it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The question followed, 'Where was I to go?' I dreamt of

Miss Ingram



<P>all the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates

of



<P>Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr.



<P>Rochester looked on with his arms folded- smiling sardonically, as



<P>it seemed, at both her and me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my

return;



<P>for I did not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote. I



<P>proposed to walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly,



<P>after leaving my box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the



<P>George Inn, about six o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road



<P>to Thornfield: a road which lay chiefly through fields, and was now



<P>little frequented.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though

fair and



<P>soft: the haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky,



<P>though far from cloudless, was such as promised well for the future:



<P>its blue- where blue was visible- was mild and settled, and its



<P>cloud strata high and thin. The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam



<P>chilled it- it seemed as if there was a fire lit, an altar burning



<P>behind its screen of marbled vapour, and out of apertures shone a



<P>golden redness.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that

I stopped



<P>once to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it



<P>was not to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or

to



<P>a place where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.



<P>'Mrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure,' said I; 'and



<P>little Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know



<P>very well you are thinking of another than they, and that he is not



<P>thinking of you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But what is so headstrong as youth? What so blind as



<P>inexperience? These affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the



<P>privilege of again looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me



<P>or not; and they added- 'Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may:



<P>but a few more days or weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for



<P>ever!' And then I strangled a new-born agony- a deformed thing which

I



<P>could not persuade myself to own and rear- and ran on.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather,

the



<P>labourers are just quitting their work, and returning home with



<P>their rakes on their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive. I have



<P>but a field or two to traverse, and then I shall cross the road and



<P>reach the gates. How full the hedges are of roses! But I have no



<P>time to gather any; I want to be at the house. I passed a tall



<P>briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches across the path; I see



<P>the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see- Mr. Rochester sitting



<P>there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung:

for



<P>a moment I am beyond my own mastery. What does it mean? I did not



<P>think I should tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice

or



<P>the power of motion in his presence. I will go back as soon as I can



<P>stir: I need not make an absolute fool of myself. I know another way



<P>to the house. It does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has



<P>seen me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hillo!' he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.

'There



<P>you are! Come on, if you please.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not;

being



<P>scarcely cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear



<P>calm; and, above all, to control the working muscles of my face- which



<P>I feel rebel insolently against my will, and struggle to express



<P>what I had resolved to conceal. But I have a veil- it is down: I may



<P>make shift yet to behave with decent composure.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And this is Jane Eyre? Are you coming from Millcote, and

on



<P>foot? Yes- just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and



<P>come clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to



<P>steal into the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if



<P>you were a dream or a shade. What the deuce have you done with



<P>yourself this last month?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A true Janian reply! Good angels be my guard. She comes

from the



<P>other world- from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so



<P>when she meets me alone here in the gloaming! If I dared, I'd touch



<P>you, to see if you are substance or shadow, you elf!- but I'd as



<P>soon offer to take hold of a blue ignis fatuus light in a marsh.



<P>Truant! truant!' he added, when he had paused an instant. 'Absent from



<P>me a whole month, and forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again,

even



<P>though broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my



<P>master, and by the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there



<P>was ever in Mr. Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the



<P>power of communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he



<P>scattered to stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast



<P>genially. His last words were balm: they seemed to imply that it



<P>imported something to him whether I forgot him or not. And he had



<P>spoken of Thornfield as my home- would that it were my home!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to

go by. I



<P>inquired soon if he had not been to London.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And did she inform you what I went to do?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, yes, sir! Everybody knew your errand.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't

think it



<P>will suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like



<P>Queen Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions. I wish,



<P>Jane, I were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.



<P>Tell me now, fairy as you are- can't you give me a charm, or a



<P>philter, or something of that sort, to make me a handsome man?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It would be past the power of magic, sir'; and, in thought,

I



<P>added, 'A loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome



<P>enough; or rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with

an



<P>acumen to me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no



<P>notice of my abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain



<P>smile he had of his own, and which he used but on rare occasions. He



<P>seemed to think it too good for common purposes: it was the real



<P>sunshine of feeling- he shed it over me now.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pass, Janet,' said he, making room for me to cross the

stile:



<P>'go up home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's



<P>threshold.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need

for me to



<P>colloquise further. I got over the stile without a word, and meant



<P>to leave him calmly. An impulse held me fast- a force turned me round.



<P>I said- or something in me said for me, and in spite of me-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am



<P>strangely glad to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my



<P>home- my only home.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken

me had



<P>he tried. Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.



<P>Mrs. Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness. Leah



<P>smiled, and even Sophie bid me 'bon soir' with glee. This was very



<P>pleasant; there is no happiness like that of being loved by your



<P>fellow-creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to



<P>their comfort.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future:

I



<P>stopped my ears against the voice that kept warning me of near



<P>separation and coming grief. When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had



<P>taken her knitting, and I had assumed a low seat near her, and



<P>Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had nestled close up to me, and a sense



<P>of mutual affection seemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace,



<P>I uttered a silent prayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but



<P>when, as we thus sat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and



<P>looking at us, seemed to take pleasure in the spectacle of a group



<P>so amicable- when he said he supposed the old lady was all right now



<P>that she had got her adopted daughter back again, and added that he



<P>saw Adele was 'prete a croquer sa petite maman Anglaise'- I half



<P>ventured to hope that he would, even after his marriage, keep us



<P>together somewhere under the shelter of his protection, and not



<P>quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield

Hall.



<P>Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation



<P>going on for such an event. Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if



<P>she had yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the



<P>negative. Once she said she had actually put the question to Mr.



<P>Rochester as to when he was going to bring his bride home; but he



<P>had answered her only by a joke and one of his queer looks, and she



<P>could not tell what to make of him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were

no



<P>journeyings backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure



<P>it was twenty miles off, on the borders of another county; but what



<P>was that distance to an ardent lover? To so practised and



<P>indefatigable a horseman as Mr. Rochester, it would be but a morning's



<P>ride. I began to cherish hopes I had no right to conceive: that the



<P>match was broken off; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or



<P>both parties had changed their minds. I used to look at my master's



<P>face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could not remember the



<P>time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings.



<P>If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and



<P>sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay. Never had he



<P>called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder to me



<P>when there- and, alas! never had I loved him so well.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE daylight came. I rose at dawn. I busied myself for

an hour or



<P>two with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe,



<P>in the order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief



<P>absence. Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room. He stopped at my



<P>door: I feared he would knock- no, but a slip of paper was passed



<P>under the door. I took it up. It bore these words-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You left me too suddenly last night. Had you stayed but

a little



<P>longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the



<P>angel's crown. I shall expect your clear decision when I return this



<P>day fortnight. Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into



<P>temptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see,



<P>is weak. I shall pray for you hourly.- Yours, ST. JOHN.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My spirit,' I answered mentally, 'is willing to do what

is



<P>right; and my flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will



<P>of Heaven, when once that will is distinctly known to me. At any rate,



<P>it shall be strong enough to search- inquire- to grope an outlet



<P>from this cloud of doubt, and find the open day of certainty.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast

and



<P>chilly: rain beat fast on my casement. I heard the front-door open,



<P>and St. John pass out. Looking through the window, I saw him



<P>traverse the garden. He took the way over the misty moors in the



<P>direction of Whitcross- there he would meet the coach.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track,

cousin,'



<P>thought I: 'I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross. I too have some



<P>to see and ask after in England, before I depart for ever.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the

interval in



<P>walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had



<P>given my plans their present bent. I recalled that inward sensation



<P>I had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable



<P>strangeness. I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned



<P>whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in me- not in the



<P>external world. I asked was it a mere nervous impression- a



<P>delusion? I could not conceive or believe: it was more like an



<P>inspiration. The wondrous shock of feeling had come like the



<P>earthquake which shook the foundations of Paul and Silas's prison;



<P>it had opened the doors of the soul's cell and loosed its bands- it



<P>had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it sprang trembling,



<P>listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear,



<P>and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which neither feared



<P>nor shook but exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it



<P>had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous body.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ere many days,' I said, as I terminated my musings, 'I

will know



<P>something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me. Letters



<P>have proved of no avail- personal inquiry shall replace them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going

a



<P>journey, and should be absent at least four days.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Alone, Jane?' they asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom

I had for



<P>some time been uneasy.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought,

that they



<P>had believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I



<P>had often said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they



<P>abstained from comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was



<P>well enough to travel. I looked very pale, she observed. I replied,



<P>that nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to



<P>alleviate.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was

troubled



<P>with no inquiries- no surmises. Having once explained to them that I



<P>could not now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely



<P>acquiesced in the silence with which I pursued them, according to me



<P>the privilege of free action I should under similar circumstances have



<P>accorded them.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I left Moor House at three o'clock P.M., and soon after

four I



<P>stood at the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival



<P>of the coach which was to take me to distant Thornfield. Amidst the



<P>silence of those solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it



<P>approach from a great distance. It was the same vehicle whence, a year



<P>ago, I had alighted one summer evening on this very spot- how



<P>desolate, and hopeless, and objectless! It stopped as I beckoned. I



<P>entered- not now obliged to part with my whole fortune as the price

of



<P>its accommodation. Once more on the road to Thornfield, I felt like



<P>the messenger-pigeon flying home.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours. I had set out

from



<P>Whitcross on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday



<P>morning the coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn,



<P>situated in the midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields



<P>and low pastoral hills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue



<P>compared with the stern North-Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye



<P>like the lineaments of a once familiar face. Yes, I knew the character



<P>of this landscape: I was sure we were near my bourne.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How far is Thornfield Hall from here?' I asked of the

ostler.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My journey is closed,' I thought to myself. I got out

of the



<P>coach, gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I



<P>called for it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going:



<P>the brightening day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt



<P>letters, 'The Rochester Arms.' My heart leapt up: I was already on



<P>my master's very lands. It fell again: the thought struck it:-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel,

for aught



<P>you know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you



<P>hasten, who besides him is there? His lunatic wife: and you have



<P>nothing to do with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his



<P>presence. You have lost your labour- you had better go no farther,'



<P>urged the monitor. 'Ask information of the people at the inn; they can



<P>give you all you seek: they can solve your doubts at once. Go up to



<P>that man, and inquire if Mr. Rochester be at home.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force

self to



<P>act on it. I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair. To



<P>prolong doubt was to prolong hope. I might yet once more see the



<P>Hall under the ray of her star. There was the stile before me- the



<P>very fields through which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted



<P>with a revengeful fury tracking and scourging me, on the morning I



<P>fled from Thornfield: ere I well knew what course I had resolved to



<P>take, I was in the midst of them. How fast I walked! How I ran



<P>sometimes? How I looked forward to catch the first view of the



<P>well-known woods! With what feelings I welcomed single trees I knew,



<P>and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between them!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud

cawing



<P>broke the morning stillness. Strange delight inspired me: on I



<P>hastened. Another field crossed- a lane threaded- and there were the



<P>courtyard walls- the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still



<P>hid. 'My first view of it shall be in front,' I determined, 'where its



<P>bold battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can



<P>single out my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it-



<P>he rises early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the



<P>pavement in front. Could I but see him!- but a moment? Surely, in that



<P>case, I should not be so mad as to run to him? I cannot tell- I am not



<P>certain. And if I did- what then? God bless him! What then? Who



<P>would be hurt by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?



<P>I rave: perhaps at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the



<P>Pyrenees, or on the tideless sea of the south.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard- turned

its



<P>angle: there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between



<P>two stone pillars crowned by stone balls. From behind one pillar I



<P>could peep round quietly at the full front of the mansion. I



<P>advanced my head with precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom



<P>window-blinds were yet drawn up: battlements, windows, long front- all



<P>from this sheltered station were at my command.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took

this



<P>survey. I wonder what they thought. They must have considered I was



<P>very careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold



<P>and reckless. A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from



<P>my niche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full

in



<P>front of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.



<P>'What affectation of diffidence was this at first?' they might have



<P>demanded; 'what stupid regardlessness now?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear an illustration, reader.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes

to



<P>catch a glimpse of her fair face without waking her. He steals



<P>softly over the grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses- fancying



<P>she has stirred: he withdraws; not for worlds would he be seen. All

is



<P>still: he again advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on



<P>her features: he lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the



<P>vision of beauty- warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest. How hurried



<P>was their first glance! But how they fix! How he starts! How he



<P>suddenly and vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a



<P>moment since, touch with his finger! How he calls aloud a name, and



<P>drops his burden, and gazes on it wildly! He thus grasps and cries,



<P>and gazes, because he no longer fears to waken by any sound he can



<P>utter- by any movement he can make. He thought his love slept sweetly:



<P>he finds she is stone dead.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw

a



<P>blackened ruin.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!- to peep up

at chamber



<P>lattices, fearing life was astir behind them! No need to listen for



<P>doors opening- to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!



<P>The lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned



<P>void. The front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a



<P>shell-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking, perforated with



<P>paneless windows: no roof, no battlements, no chimneys- all had



<P>crashed in.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude

of a



<P>lonesome wild. No wonder that letters addressed to people here had



<P>never received an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a



<P>church aisle. The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the



<P>Hall had fallen- by conflagration: but how kindled? What story



<P>belonged to this disaster? What loss, besides mortar and marble and



<P>woodwork had followed upon it? Had life been wrecked as well as



<P>property? If so, whose? Dreadful question: there was no one here to



<P>answer it- not even dumb sign, mute token.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In wandering round the shattered walls and through the

devastated



<P>interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late



<P>occurrence. Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void



<P>arch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst



<P>the drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation:



<P>grass and weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen



<P>rafters. And oh! where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?



<P>In what land? Under what auspices? My eye involuntarily wandered to



<P>the grey church tower near the gates, and I asked, 'Is he with Damer



<P>de Rochester, sharing the shelter of his narrow marble house?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some answer must be had to these questions. I could find

it nowhere



<P>but at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned. The host himself



<P>brought my breakfast into the parlour. I requested him to shut the



<P>door and sit down: I had some questions to ask him. But when he



<P>complied, I scarcely knew how to begin; such horror had I of the



<P>possible answers. And yet the spectacle of desolation I had just



<P>left prepared me in a measure for a tale of misery. The host was a



<P>respectable-looking, middle-aged man.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You know Thornfield Hall, of course?' I managed to say

at last.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, ma'am; I lived there once.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you?' Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger

to me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler,' he added.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The late! I seem to have received, with full force, the

blow I



<P>had been trying to evade.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The late!' I gasped. 'Is he dead?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father,' he



<P>explained. I breathed again: my blood resumed its flow. Fully



<P>assured by these words that Mr. Edward- my Mr. Rochester (God bless



<P>him, wherever he was!)- was at least alive: was, in short, 'the



<P>present gentleman.' Gladdening words! It seemed I could hear all



<P>that was to come- whatever the disclosures might be- with



<P>comparative tranquillity. Since he was not in the grave, I could bear,



<P>I thought, to learn that he was at the Antipodes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?' I asked,

knowing,



<P>of course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the



<P>direct question as to where he really was.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, ma'am- oh, no! No one is living there. I suppose you

are a



<P>stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last



<P>autumn,- Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about



<P>harvest-time. A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of



<P>valuable property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be



<P>saved. The fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines



<P>arrived from Millcote, the building was one mass of flame. It was a



<P>terrible spectacle: I witnessed it myself.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'At dead of night!' I muttered. Yes, that was ever the

hour of



<P>fatality at Thornfield. 'Was it known how it originated?' I demanded.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They guessed, ma'am: they guessed. Indeed, I should say

it was



<P>ascertained beyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware,' he



<P>continued, edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking



<P>low, 'that there was a lady- a- a lunatic, kept in the house?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have heard something of it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am; people

even for



<P>some years was not absolutely certain of her existence. No one saw



<P>her: they only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall;



<P>and who or what she was it was difficult to conjecture. They said



<P>Mr. Edward had brought her from abroad, and some believed she had been



<P>his mistress. But a queer thing happened a year since- a very queer



<P>thing.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I feared now to hear my own story. I endeavoured to recall

him to



<P>the main fact.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And this lady?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This lady, ma'am,' he answered, 'turned out to be Mr.



<P>Rochester's wife! The discovery was brought about in the strangest



<P>way. There was a young lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr.



<P>Rochester fell in-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But the fire,' I suggested.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'm coming to that, ma'am- that Mr. Edward fell in love

with.



<P>The servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was:



<P>he was after her continually. They used to watch him- servants will,



<P>you know, ma'am- and he set store on her past everything: for all,



<P>nobody but him thought her so very handsome. She was a little small



<P>thing, they say, almost like a child. I never saw her myself; but I've



<P>heard Leah, the housemaid, tell of her. Leah liked her well enough.



<P>Mr. Rochester was about forty, and this governess not twenty; and



<P>you see, when gentlemen of his age fall in love with girls, they are



<P>often like as if they were bewitched. Well, he would marry her.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You shall tell me this part of the story another time,'

I said;



<P>'but now I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about



<P>the fire. Was it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had



<P>any hand in it?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her,

and



<P>nobody but her, that set it going. She had a woman to take care of her



<P>called Mrs. Poole- an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy,



<P>but for one fault- a fault common to a deal of them nurses and



<P>matrons- she kept a private bottle of gin by her, and now and then



<P>took a drop over-much. It is excusable, for she had a hard life of it:



<P>but still it was dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep



<P>after the gin and water, the mad lady, who was as cunning as a



<P>witch, would take the keys out of her pocket, let herself out of her



<P>chamber, and go roaming about the house, doing any wild mischief



<P>that came into her head. They say she had nearly burnt her husband



<P>in his bed once: but I don't know about that. However, on this



<P>night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her own,



<P>and then she got down to a lower Storey, and made her way to the



<P>chamber that had been the governess's- (she was like as if she knew



<P>somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)- and she



<P>kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it,



<P>fortunately. The governess had run away two months before; and for all



<P>Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing

he



<P>had in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew



<P>savage- quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man,



<P>but he got dangerous after he lost her. He would be alone, too. He



<P>sent Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance;



<P>but he did it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life:



<P>and she deserved it- she was a very good woman. Miss Adele, a ward



<P>he had, was put to school. He broke off acquaintance with all the



<P>gentry, and shut himself up like a hermit at the Hall.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What! did he not leave England?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Leave England? Bless you, no! He would not cross the door-stones



<P>of the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost



<P>about the grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses-



<P>which it is my opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener



<P>gentleman than he was before that midge of a governess crossed him,



<P>you never saw, ma'am. He was not a man given to wine, or cards, or



<P>racing, as some are, and he was not so very handsome; but he had a



<P>courage and a will of his own, if ever man had. I knew him from a boy,



<P>you see: and for my part, I have often wished that Miss Eyre had



<P>been sunk in the sea before she came to Thornfield Hall.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when

all was



<P>burning above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and



<P>helped them down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her



<P>cell. And then they called out to him that she was on the roof,



<P>where she was standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and



<P>shouting out till they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and



<P>heard her with my own eyes. She was a big woman, and had long black



<P>hair: we could see it streaming against the flames as she stood. I



<P>witnessed, and several more witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through



<P>the skylight on to the roof; we heard him call "Bertha!" We saw him



<P>approach her; and then, ma'am, she yelled and gave a spring, and the



<P>next minute she lay smashed on the pavement.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dead?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dead! Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood

were



<P>scattered.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good God!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He shuddered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And afterwards?' I urged.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground:

there



<P>are only some bits of walls standing now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Were any other lives lost?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No- perhaps it would have been better if there had.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do you mean?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Poor Mr. Edward!' he ejaculated, 'I little thought ever

to have



<P>seen it? Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his



<P>first marriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had



<P>one living: but I pity him, for my part.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You said he was alive?' I exclaimed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be

dead.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why? How?' My blood was again running cold. 'Where is

he?' I



<P>demanded. 'Is he in England?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ay- ay- he's in England; he can't get out of England,

I fancy-



<P>he's a fixture now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What agony was this! And the man seemed resolved to protract

it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is stone-blind,' he said at last. 'Yes, he is stone-blind,

is



<P>Mr. Edward.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had dreaded worse. I had dreaded he was mad. I summoned



<P>strength to ask what had caused this calamity.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness,

in a



<P>way, ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out



<P>before him. As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs.



<P>Rochester had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great



<P>crash- all fell. He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but



<P>sadly hurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him



<P>partly; but one eye was knocked out, and one hand so crushed that



<P>Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to amputate it directly. The other eye



<P>inflamed: he lost the sight of that also. He is now helpless,



<P>indeed- blind and a cripple.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where is he? Where does he now live?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty

miles



<P>off: quite a desolate spot.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who is with him?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Old John and his wife: he would have none else. He is

quite broken



<P>down, they say.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you any sort of conveyance?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can

drive me



<P>to Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and him twice



<P>the hire you usually demand.'

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. ROCHESTER, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went

to bed early



<P>that night; nor did he rise soon next morning. When he did come



<P>down, it was to attend to business: his agent and some of his



<P>tenants were arrived, and waiting to speak with him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be

in daily



<P>requisition as a reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an



<P>apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for



<P>the future schoolroom. I discerned in the course of the morning that



<P>Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church,



<P>it echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of



<P>the bell: steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke



<P>in different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing



<P>through it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply:

she kept



<P>running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could



<P>get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go



<P>downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,



<P>where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry,



<P>and made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her 'ami,



<P>Monsieur Edouard Fairfax de Rochester,' as she dubbed him (I had not



<P>before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had



<P>brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that



<P>when his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it

a



<P>little box in whose contents she had an interest.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Et cela doit signifier,' said she, 'qu'il y aura la dedans

un



<P>cadeau pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.



<P>Monsieur a parle de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante,



<P>et si elle n'etait pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu



<P>pale. J'ai dit qu'oui: car c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour;

the



<P>afternoon was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom. At



<P>dark I allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run



<P>downstairs; for, from the comparative silence below, and from the



<P>cessation of appeals to the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr.



<P>Rochester was now at liberty. Left alone, I walked to the window;



<P>but nothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together



<P>thickened the air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn. I let down the



<P>curtain and went back to the fireside.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a

picture I



<P>remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine,



<P>when Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery



<P>mosaic I had been piecing together, and scattering too some heavy



<P>unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would

take tea



<P>with him in the drawing-room this evening,' said she: 'he has been



<P>so much engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When is his tea-time?' I inquired.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.

You had



<P>better change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it. Here



<P>is a candle.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it necessary to change my frock?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when

Mr.



<P>Rochester is here.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however,

I



<P>repaired to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black



<P>stuff dress by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one



<P>I had, except one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the



<P>toilette, I thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate



<P>occasions.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You want a brooch,' said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single

little pearl



<P>ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,



<P>and then we went downstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was



<P>rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's



<P>presence. I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept



<P>in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch,



<P>whose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on

the



<P>mantelpiece; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay



<P>Pilot- Adele knelt near him. Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr.



<P>Rochester, his foot supported by the cushion; he was looking at



<P>Adele and the dog: the fire shone full on his face. I knew my



<P>traveller with his broad and jetty eyebrows; his square forehead, made



<P>squarer by the horizontal sweep of his black hair. I recognised his



<P>decisive nose, more remarkable for character than beauty; his full



<P>nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler; his grim mouth, chin, and



<P>jaw- yes, all three were very grim, and no mistake. His shape, now



<P>divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in squareness with his



<P>physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of



<P>the term- broad chested and thin flanked, though neither tall nor



<P>graceful.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs.



<P>Fairfax and myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice



<P>us, for he never lifted his head as we approached.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Here is Miss Eyre, sir,' said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet

way. He



<P>bowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let Miss Eyre be seated,' said he: and there was something

in



<P>the forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed



<P>further to express, 'What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be



<P>there or not? At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished

politeness



<P>would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid



<P>it by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice



<P>laid me under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence,



<P>under the freak of manner, gave me the advantage. Besides, the



<P>eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see



<P>how he would go on.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke

nor



<P>moved. Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one



<P>should be amiable, and she began to talk. Kindly, as usual- and, as



<P>usual, rather trite- she condoled with him on the pressure of business



<P>he had had all day; on the annoyance it must have been to him with



<P>that painful sprain: then she commended his patience and



<P>perseverance in going through with it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madam, I should like some tea,' was the sole rejoinder

she got.



<P>She hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded



<P>to arrange the cups, spoons, etc., with assiduous celerity. I and



<P>Adele went to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?' said Mrs. Fairfax

to me;



<P>'Adele might perhaps spill it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand, Adele,



<P>thinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour,



<P>cried out-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle

Eyre



<P>dans votre petit coffre?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who talks of cadeaux?' said he gruffly. 'Did you expect

a present,



<P>Miss Eyre? Are you fond of presents?' and he searched my face with



<P>eyes that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them:

they are



<P>generally thought pleasant things.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Generally thought? But what do you think?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could

give you



<P>an answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it,



<P>has it not? and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion



<P>as to its nature.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she

demands



<P>a "cadeau," clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the



<P>bush.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele

has: she



<P>can prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom;



<P>for she says you have always been in the habit of giving her



<P>playthings; but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since



<P>I am a stranger, and have done nothing to entitle me to an



<P>acknowledgment.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty! I have examined Adele,

and



<P>find you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has



<P>no talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, you have now given me my "cadeau"; I am obliged to

you: it is



<P>the meed teachers most covet-praise of their pupils' progress.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Humph!' said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come to the fire,' said the master, when the tray was

taken



<P>away, and Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting;



<P>while Adele was leading me by the hand round the room, showing me



<P>the beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.



<P>We obeyed, as in duty bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee,



<P>but she was ordered to amuse herself with Pilot.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have been resident in my house three months?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you came from-?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! a charitable concern. How long were you there?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Eight years.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Eight years! you must be tenacious of life. I thought

half the



<P>time in such a place would have done up any constitution! No wonder



<P>you have rather the look of another world. I marvelled where you had



<P>got that sort of face. When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I



<P>thought unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand



<P>whether you had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet. Who are your



<P>parents?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have none.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I thought not. And so you were waiting for your people

when you



<P>sat on that stile?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For whom, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening

for



<P>them. Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that



<P>damned ice on the causeway?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head. 'The men in green all forsook England

a hundred



<P>years ago,' said I, speaking as seriously as he had done. 'And not



<P>even in Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of



<P>them. I don't think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will



<P>ever shine on their revels more.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised

eyebrows,



<P>seemed wondering what sort of talk this was.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well,' resumed Mr. Rochester, 'if you disown parents,

you must



<P>have some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; none that I ever saw.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And your home?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have none.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where do your brothers and sisters live?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have no brothers or sisters.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who recommended you to come here?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' said the good lady, who now knew what ground we

were upon,



<P>'and I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.



<P>Miss Eyre has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and



<P>careful teacher to Adele.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't trouble yourself to give her a character,' returned

Mr.



<P>Rochester: 'eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.



<P>She began by felling my horse.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir?' said Mrs. Fairfax.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have to thank her for this sprain.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The widow looked bewildered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you seen much society?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the

inmates of



<P>Thornfield.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you read much?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been

numerous



<P>or very learned.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well

drilled in



<P>religious forms;- Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is



<P>a parson, is he not?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full

of



<P>religieuses would worship their director.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, no.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are very cool! No! What! a novice not worship her

priest! That



<P>sounds blasphemous.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the

feeling.



<P>He is a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our



<P>hair; and for economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with



<P>which we could hardly sew.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That was very false economy,' remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who

now again



<P>caught the drift of the dialogue.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And was that the head and front of his offending?' demanded

Mr.



<P>Rochester.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of

the



<P>provision department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored



<P>us with long lectures once a week, and with evening readings from



<P>books of his own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which



<P>made us afraid to go to bed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What age were you when you went to Lowood?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'About ten.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I assented.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should

hardly



<P>have been able to guess your age. It is a point difficult to fix where



<P>the features and countenance are so much at variance as in your



<P>case. And now what did you learn at Lowood? Can you play?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A little.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of course: that is the established answer. Go into the

library-



<P>I mean, if you please.- (Excuse my tone of command; I am used to



<P>say, "Do this," and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for



<P>one new inmate.)- Go, then, into the library; take a candle with



<P>you; leave the door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I departed, obeying his directions.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Enough!' he called out in a few minutes. 'You play a little,

I



<P>see; like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than



<P>some, but not well.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester continued-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Adele showed me some sketches this morning, which she

said were



<P>yours. I don't know whether they were entirely of your doing; probably



<P>a master aided you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, indeed!' I interjected.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! that pricks pride. Well, fetch me your portfolio,

if you can



<P>vouch for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless



<P>you are certain: I can recognise patchwork.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself,

sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I brought the portfolio from the library.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Approach the table,' said he; and I wheeled it to his

couch. Adele



<P>and Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No crowding,' said Mr. Rochester: 'take the drawings from

my



<P>hand as I finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting. Three

he laid



<P>aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,' said

he, 'and



<P>look at them with Adele;- you' (glancing at me) 'resume your seat, and



<P>answer my questions. I perceive those pictures were done by one



<P>hand: was that hand yours?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And when did you find time to do them? They have taken

much



<P>time, and some thought.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood,

when I had



<P>no other occupation.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where did you get your copies?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Out of my head.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That head I see now on your shoulders?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Has it other furniture of the same kind within?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I should think it may have: I should hope- better.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them



<P>alternately.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what

they are:



<P>and first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful. The



<P>subjects had, indeed, risen vividly on my mind. As I saw them with the



<P>spiritual eye, before I attempted to embody them, they were



<P>striking; but my hand would not second my fancy, and in each case it



<P>had wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; These pictures were in water-colours. The first represented



<P>clouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was



<P>in eclipse; so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest



<P>billows, for there was no land. One gleam of light lifted into



<P>relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and



<P>large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set



<P>with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette



<P>could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart.



<P>Sinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through



<P>the green water; a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible,



<P>whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second picture contained for foreground only the dim

peak of



<P>a hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.



<P>Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight:



<P>rising into the sky was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in



<P>tints as dusk and soft as I could combine. The dim forehead was



<P>crowned with a star; the lineaments below were seen as through the



<P>suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair streamed



<P>shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail.



<P>On the neck lay a pale reflection like moonlight; the same faint



<P>lustre touched the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed this



<P>vision of the Evening Star.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a

polar winter



<P>sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close



<P>serried, along the horizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the



<P>foreground, a head,- a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg,



<P>and resting against it. Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and



<P>supporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil; a



<P>brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed,



<P>blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were



<P>visible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black



<P>drapery, vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a



<P>ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge.



<P>This pale crescent was 'the likeness of a kingly crown'; what it



<P>diademed was 'the shape which shape had none.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Were you happy when you painted these pictures?' asked

Mr.



<P>Rochester presently.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them,

in



<P>short, was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account,

have



<P>been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's



<P>dreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you



<P>sit at them long each day?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation,

and I sat



<P>at them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length



<P>of the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent



<P>labours?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Far from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my

idea and



<P>my handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was



<P>quite powerless to realise.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought;

but no



<P>more, probably. You had not enough of the artist's skill and science



<P>to give it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl,



<P>peculiar. As to the thoughts, they are elfish. These eyes in the



<P>Evening Star you must have seen in a dream. How could you make them



<P>look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above



<P>quells their rays. And what meaning is that in their solemn depth? And



<P>who taught you to paint wind? There is a high gale in that sky, and

on



<P>this hill-top. Where did you see Latmos? For that is Latmos. There!



<P>put the drawings away!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking

at



<P>his watch, he said abruptly-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to

let Adele



<P>sit up so long? Take her to bed!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured

the



<P>caress, but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have



<P>done, nor so much.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wish you all good-night, now,' said he, making a movement

of the



<P>hand towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company,



<P>and wished to dismiss us. Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I



<P>took my portfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in



<P>return, and so withdrew.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs.

Fairfax,'



<P>I observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to



<P>bed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, is he?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am

so



<P>accustomed to his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has



<P>peculiarities of temper, allowance should be made.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Partly because it is his nature- and we can none of us

help our



<P>nature; and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to



<P>harass him, and make his spirits unequal.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What about?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Family troubles, for one thing.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But he has no family.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not now, but he has had- or, at least, relatives. He lost

his



<P>elder brother a few years since.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'His elder brother?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes. The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long

in



<P>possession of the property; only about nine years.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nine years is a tolerable time. Was he so very fond of

his brother



<P>as to be still inconsolable for his loss?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, no- perhaps not. I believe there were some



<P>misunderstandings between them. Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite



<P>just to Mr. Edward; and perhaps he prejudiced his father against



<P>him. The old gentleman was fond of money, and anxious to keep the



<P>family estate together. He did not like to diminish the property by



<P>division, and yet he was anxious that Mr. Edward should have wealth,



<P>too, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon after he was

of



<P>age, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a



<P>great deal of mischief. Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined



<P>to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a painful position, for



<P>the sake of making his fortune: what the precise nature of that



<P>position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could not brook what



<P>he had to suffer in it. He is not very forgiving: he broke with his



<P>family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life.

I



<P>don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight



<P>together, since the death of his brother without a will left him



<P>master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why should he shun it?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps he thinks it gloomy.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer;



<P>but Mrs. Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit



<P>information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials. She



<P>averred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was



<P>chiefly from conjecture. It was evident, indeed, that she wished me

to



<P>drop the subject, which I did accordingly.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; MY first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden

age



<P>either; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in



<P>habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks. The fear of



<P>failure in these points harassed me worse than the physical



<P>hardships of my lot; though these were no trifles.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows,

and,



<P>after their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our



<P>stirring beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within



<P>these limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air. Our



<P>clothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold: we had



<P>no boots, the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our ungloved



<P>hands became numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I



<P>remember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause



<P>every evening, when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the



<P>swelled, raw, and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning. Then the



<P>scanty supply of food was distressing: with the keen appetites of



<P>growing children, we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a



<P>delicate invalid. From this deficiency of nourishment resulted an



<P>abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils: whenever the



<P>famished great girls had an opportunity, they would coax or menace the



<P>little ones out of their portion. Many a time I have shared between



<P>two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at



<P>teatime; and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of my



<P>mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment

of



<P>secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season. We had

to walk



<P>two miles to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated. We set



<P>out cold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we



<P>became almost paralysed. It was too far to return to dinner, and an



<P>allowance of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion



<P>observed in our ordinary meals, was served round between the services.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an

exposed and



<P>hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of



<P>snowy summits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly

along our



<P>drooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered,



<P>gathered close about her, and encouraging us, by precept and



<P>example, to keep up our spirits, and march forward, as she said, 'like



<P>stalwart soldiers.' The other teachers, poor things, were generally



<P>themselves too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire

when we



<P>got back! But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each



<P>hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row

of



<P>great girls, and behind them the younger children crouched in



<P>groups, wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double

ration



<P>of bread- a whole, instead of a half, slice- with the delicious



<P>addition of a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to



<P>which we all looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath. I generally



<P>contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but



<P>the remainder I was invariably obliged to part with.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the

Church



<P>Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St.



<P>Matthew; and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose



<P>irrepressible yawns attested her weariness. A frequent interlude of



<P>these performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some



<P>half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall



<P>down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be



<P>taken up half dead. The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the



<P>centre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the



<P>sermon was finished. Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank



<P>together in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors'



<P>high stools.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst;

and



<P>indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the



<P>first month after my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his



<P>friend the archdeacon: his absence was a relief to me. I need not



<P>say that I had my own reasons for dreading his coming: but come he did



<P>at last.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood),

as I was



<P>sitting with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division,



<P>my eyes, raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure



<P>just passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline;



<P>and when, two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose



<P>en masse, it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain



<P>whose entrance they thus greeted. A long stride measured the



<P>schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen,



<P>stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously



<P>from the hearthrug of Gateshead. I now glanced sideways at this



<P>piece of architecture. Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst,



<P>buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid



<P>than ever.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition;

too



<P>well I remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my



<P>disposition, etc.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to



<P>apprise Miss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature. All along

I



<P>had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise,- I had been



<P>looking out daily for the 'Coming Man,' whose information respecting



<P>my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever:



<P>now there he was.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in

her ear: I



<P>did not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I



<P>watched her eye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see



<P>its dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt. I



<P>listened too; and as I happened to be seated quite at the top of the



<P>room, I caught most of what he said: its import relieved me from



<P>immediate apprehension.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton

will do;



<P>it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico



<P>chemises, and I sorted the needles to match. You may tell Miss Smith



<P>that I forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she



<P>shall have some papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any



<P>account, to give out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they



<P>have more, they are apt to be careless and lose them. And, O ma'am!



<P>I wish the woollen stockings were better looked to!- when I was here



<P>last, I went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying



<P>on the line; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state

of



<P>repair: from the size of the holes in them I was sure they had not



<P>been well mended from time to time.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your directions shall be attended to, sir,' said Miss

Temple.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And, ma'am,' he continued, 'the laundress tells me some

of the



<P>girls have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules



<P>limit them to one.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think I can explain that circumstance, sir. Agnes and



<P>Catherine Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at



<P>Lowton last Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers



<P>for the occasion.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the

circumstance



<P>occur too often. And there is another thing which surprised me; I



<P>find, in settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch,



<P>consisting of bread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls



<P>during the past fortnight. How is this? I looked over the regulations,



<P>and I find no such meal as lunch mentioned. Who introduced this



<P>innovation? and by what authority?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,' replied

Miss



<P>Temple: 'the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not



<P>possibly eat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till



<P>dinner-time.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madam, allow me an instant. You are aware that my plan

in bringing



<P>up these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and



<P>indulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying. Should



<P>any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as



<P>the spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish,



<P>the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something



<P>more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and



<P>obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to



<P>the spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince



<P>fortitude under the temporary privation. A brief address on those



<P>occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor



<P>would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the



<P>primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the



<P>exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples



<P>to take up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man



<P>shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out



<P>of the mouth of God; to His divine consolations, "If ye suffer



<P>hunger or thirst for My sake, happy are ye." Oh, madam, when you put



<P>bread and cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children's



<P>mouths, you may indeed feed their vile bodies, but you little think



<P>how you starve their immortal souls!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Brocklehurst again paused- perhaps overcome by his

feelings.



<P>Miss Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but



<P>she now gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as



<P>marble, appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that



<P>material; especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required



<P>a sculptor's chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into



<P>petrified severity.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with

his hands



<P>behind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly



<P>his eye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled



<P>or shocked its pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he



<P>had hitherto used-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what- what is that girl with

curled



<P>hair? Red hair, ma'am, curled- curled all over?' And extending his



<P>cane he pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is Julia Severn,' replied Miss Temple, very quietly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Julia Severn, ma'am! And why has she, or any other, curled

hair?



<P>Why, in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does



<P>she conform to the world so openly- here in an evangelical, charitable



<P>establishment- as to wear her hair one mass of curls?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Julia's hair curls naturally,' returned Miss Temple, still

more



<P>quietly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Naturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I

wish



<P>these girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance? I



<P>have again and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged



<P>closely, modestly, plainly. Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be



<P>cut off entirely; I will send a barber tomorrow: and I see others



<P>who have far too much of the excrescence- that tall girl, tell her



<P>to turn round. Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their



<P>faces to the wall.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if

to



<P>smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the



<P>order, however, and when the first class could take in what was



<P>required of them, they obeyed. Leaning a little back on my bench, I



<P>could see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on this



<P>manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them too; he



<P>would perhaps have felt that, whatever he might do with the outside

of



<P>the cup and platter, the inside was further beyond his interference



<P>than he imagined.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some

five



<P>minutes, then pronounced sentence. These words fell like the knell



<P>of doom-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All those top-knots must be cut off.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madam,' he pursued, 'I have a Master to serve whose kingdom

is not



<P>of this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of



<P>the flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and



<P>sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the



<P>young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which



<P>vanity itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off;



<P>think of the time wasted, of-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors,



<P>ladies, now entered the room. They ought to have come a little



<P>sooner to have heard his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly



<P>attired in velvet, silk, and furs. The two younger of the trio (fine



<P>girls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion,



<P>shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful



<P>head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled;



<P>the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with



<P>ermine, and she wore a false front of French curls.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple,

as Mrs.



<P>and the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the



<P>top of the room. It seems they had come in the carriage with their



<P>reverend relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the



<P>room upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper,



<P>questioned the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now



<P>proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who



<P>was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the



<P>dormitories: but I had no time to listen to what they said; other



<P>matters called off and enchained my attention.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst



<P>and Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions

to



<P>secure my personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I



<P>could only elude observation. To this end, I had sat well back on



<P>the form, and while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my



<P>slate in such a manner as to conceal my face: I might have escaped



<P>notice, had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from



<P>my hand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye



<P>upon me; I knew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up



<P>the two fragments of slate, I rallied my forces for the worst. It



<P>came.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A careless girl!' said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately

after-



<P>'It is the new pupil, I perceive.' And before I could draw breath,



<P>'I must not forget I have a word to say respecting her.' Then aloud:



<P>how loud it seemed to me! 'Let the child who broke her slate come



<P>forward!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed:

but the



<P>two great girls who sat on each side of me, set me on my legs and



<P>pushed me towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently



<P>assisted me to his very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall

not



<P>be punished.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite,'



<P>thought I; and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and



<P>Co. bounded in my pulses at the conviction. I was no Helen Burns.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fetch that stool,' said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to

a very



<P>high one from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Place the child upon it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in

no condition



<P>to note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to



<P>the height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of



<P>me, and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a



<P>cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ladies,' said he, turning to his family, 'Miss Temple,

teachers,



<P>and children, you all see this girl?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like



<P>burning-glasses against my scorched skin.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the

ordinary



<P>form of childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He



<P>has given to all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked



<P>character. Who would think that the Evil One had already found a



<P>servant and agent in her? Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A pause- in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves,

and



<P>to feel that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer



<P>to be shirked, must be firmly sustained.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My dear children,' pursued the black marble clergyman,

with



<P>pathos, 'this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my



<P>duty to warn you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs,



<P>is a little castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently

an



<P>interloper and an alien. You must be on your guard against her; you



<P>must shun her example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her



<P>from your sports, and shut her out from your converse. Teachers, you



<P>must watch her: keep your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words,



<P>scrutinise her actions, punish her body to save her soul: if,



<P>indeed, such salvation be possible, for (my tongue falters while I



<P>tell it) this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land,



<P>worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and



<P>kneels before Juggernaut- this girl is- a liar!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this

time in



<P>perfect possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts



<P>produce their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics,



<P>while the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two



<P>younger ones whispered, 'How shocking!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and



<P>charitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her



<P>own daughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl



<P>repaid by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her



<P>excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young



<P>ones, fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate their



<P>purity: she has sent her here to be healed, even as the Jews of old



<P>sent their diseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers,



<P>superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the waters to stagnate round



<P>her.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted

the top



<P>button of his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose,



<P>bowed to Miss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state



<P>from the room. Turning at the door, my judge said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let her stand half an hour longer on that stool, and let

no one



<P>speak to her during the remainder of the day.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could

not



<P>bear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the



<P>room, was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy. What

my



<P>sensations were, no language can describe; but just as they all



<P>rose, stifling my breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up



<P>and passed me: in passing, she lifted her eyes. What a strange light



<P>inspired them! What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through



<P>me! How the new feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had



<P>passed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I



<P>mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand



<P>on the stool. Helen Burns asked some slight questions about her work



<P>of Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned



<P>to her place, and smiled at me as she again went by. What a smile! I



<P>remember it now, and I know that it was the effluence of fine



<P>intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked lineaments, her



<P>thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from the aspect of



<P>an angel. Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm 'the untidy



<P>badge;' scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by Miss



<P>Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she had



<P>blotted an exercise in copying it out. Such is the imperfect nature

of



<P>man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes



<P>like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind



<P>to the full brightness of the orb.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing

by



<P>rushlight; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the



<P>ceremony of washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen. A change



<P>had taken place in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen



<P>north-east wind, whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows



<P>all night long, had made us shiver in our beds, and turned the



<P>contents of the ewers to ice.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading

was



<P>over, I felt ready to perish with cold. Breakfast-time came at last,



<P>and this morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was



<P>eatable, the quantity small. How small my portion seemed! I wished



<P>it had been doubled.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the

fourth



<P>class, and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto,

I



<P>had only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to



<P>become an actor therein. At first, being little accustomed to learn

by



<P>heart, the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the



<P>frequent change from task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was



<P>glad when, about three o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into



<P>my hands a border of muslin two yards long, together with needle,



<P>thimble, etc., and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom,



<P>with directions to hem the same. At that hour most of the others



<P>were sewing likewise; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd's



<P>chair reading, and as all was quiet, the subject of their lessons



<P>could be heard, together with the manner in which each girl



<P>acquitted herself, and the animadversions or commendations of Miss



<P>Scatcherd on the performance. It was English history: among the



<P>readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at the



<P>commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the



<P>class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to



<P>stops, she was suddenly sent to the very bottom. Even in that



<P>obscure position, Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of



<P>constant notice; she was continually addressing to her such phrases

as



<P>the following:-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Burns' (such it seems was her name: the girls here were

all called



<P>by their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), 'Burns, you are standing

on



<P>the side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately.' 'Burns, you



<P>poke your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in.' 'Burns, I insist on



<P>your holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that



<P>attitude,' etc. etc.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A chapter having been read through twice, the books were

closed and



<P>the girls examined. The lesson had comprised part of the reign of



<P>Charles I, and there were sundry questions about tonnage and



<P>poundage and ship-money, which most of them appeared unable to answer;



<P>still, every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached



<P>Burns: her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole



<P>lesson, and she was ready with answers on every point. I kept



<P>expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead



<P>of that, she suddenly cried out-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your

nails



<P>this morning!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why,' thought I, 'does she not explain that she could

neither



<P>clean her nails nor wash her face, as the water was frozen?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring

me to hold a



<P>skein of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from



<P>time to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether



<P>I could mark, stitch, knit, etc.; till she dismissed me, I could not



<P>pursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements. When I



<P>returned to my seat, that lady was just delivering an order of which

I



<P>did not catch the import; but Burns immediately left the class, and



<P>going into the small inner room where the books were kept, returned

in



<P>half a minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together

at



<P>one end. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a



<P>respectful curtsey; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed



<P>her pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her



<P>neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to



<P>Burns's eye; and, while I paused from my sewing, because my fingers



<P>quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent



<P>anger, not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary



<P>expression.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hardened girl!' exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; 'nothing can

correct you



<P>of your slatternly habits: carry the rod away.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from

the



<P>book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her



<P>pocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest

fraction



<P>of the day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee



<P>swallowed at five o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not



<P>satisfied hunger: the long restraint of the day was slackened; the



<P>schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning- its fires being allowed

to



<P>burn a little more brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place



<P>of candles, not yet introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed



<P>uproar, the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of



<P>liberty.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd

flog



<P>her pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and



<P>laughing groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I



<P>passed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out;



<P>it snowed fast, a drift was already forming against the lower panes;



<P>putting my ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the



<P>gleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents,

this



<P>would have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted



<P>the separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart, this



<P>obscure chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from



<P>both a strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the



<P>wind to howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the



<P>confusion to rise to clamour.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my

way to one



<P>of the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found



<P>Burns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the



<P>companionship of a book, which she read by the dim glare of the



<P>embers.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it still Rasselas?' I asked, coming behind her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' she said, 'and I have just finished it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And in five minutes more she shut it up. I was glad of

this.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now,' thought I, 'I can perhaps get her to talk.' I sat

down by



<P>her on the floor.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is your name besides Burns?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Helen.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you come a long way from here?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders

of



<P>Scotland.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will you ever go back?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You must wish to leave Lowood?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No! why should I? I was sent to Lowood to get an education;

and it



<P>would be of no use going away until I have attained that object.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cruel? Not at all! She is severe: she dislikes my faults.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should



<P>resist her. If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her



<P>hand; I should break it under her nose.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you

did, Mr.



<P>Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great



<P>grief to your relations. It is far better to endure patiently a



<P>smart which nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action



<P>whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and



<P>besides, the Bible bids us return good for evil.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be

sent to



<P>stand in the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great



<P>girl: I am far younger than you, and I could not bear it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not

avoid it:



<P>it is weak and silly to say you cannot bear what it is your fate to

be



<P>required to bear.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine

of



<P>endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the



<P>forbearance she expressed for her chastiser. Still I felt that Helen



<P>Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes. I suspected



<P>she might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter



<P>deeply; like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You say you have faults, Helen: what are they? To me you

seem very



<P>good.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am,

as Miss



<P>Scatcherd said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things in



<P>order; I am careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my



<P>lessons; I have no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot



<P>bear to be subjected to systematic arrangements. This is all very



<P>provoking to Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and



<P>particular.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And cross and cruel,' I added; but Helen Burns would not

admit



<P>my addition: she kept silence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted

over



<P>her grave face.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe

to



<P>any one, even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells



<P>me of them gently; and if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives

me



<P>my meed liberally. One strong proof of my wretchedly defective



<P>nature is, that even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have

no



<P>influence to cure me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value



<P>it most highly, cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is curious,' said I, 'it is so easy to be careful.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For you I have no doubt it is. I observed you in your

class this



<P>morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never



<P>seemed to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned



<P>you. Now, mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to



<P>Miss Scatcherd, and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I



<P>lose the very sound of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.



<P>Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland, and that the noises I hear



<P>round me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through



<P>Deepden, near our house;- then, when it comes to my turn to reply, I



<P>have to be awakened; and having heard nothing of what was read for



<P>listening to the visionary brook, I have no answer ready.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet how well you replied this afternoon.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading

had



<P>interested me. This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was



<P>wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and



<P>unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity



<P>it was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see

no



<P>farther than the prerogatives of the crown. If he had but been able

to



<P>look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age



<P>was tending! Still, I like Charles- I respect him- I pity him, poor



<P>murdered king! Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they



<P>had no right to shed. How dared they kill him!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could

not



<P>very well understand her- that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the



<P>subject she discussed. I recalled her to my level.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander

then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, certainly, not often: because Miss Temple has generally



<P>something to say which is newer than my own reflections; her



<P>language is singularly agreeable to me, and the information she



<P>communicates is often just what I wished to gain.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination



<P>guides me. There is no merit in such goodness.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.

It is all



<P>I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to



<P>those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all



<P>their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never



<P>alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without

a



<P>reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should-

so



<P>hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older:

as yet you



<P>are but a little untaught girl.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever

I do to



<P>please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish



<P>me unjustly. It is as natural as that I should love those who show



<P>me affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians



<P>and civilised nations disown it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How? I don't understand.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is not violence that best overcomes hate- nor vengeance

that



<P>most certainly heals injury.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says,

and how He



<P>acts; make His word your rule, and His conduct your example.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What does He say?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good

to them that



<P>hate you and despitefully use you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should

bless



<P>her son John, which is impossible.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded



<P>forthwith to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and



<P>resentments. Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt,



<P>without reserve or softening.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would

then make



<P>a remark, but she said nothing.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well,' I asked impatiently, 'is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted,



<P>bad woman?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see,

she



<P>dislikes your cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but



<P>how minutely you remember all she has done and said to you! What a



<P>singularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your



<P>heart! No ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings. Would you not



<P>be happier if you tried to forget her severity, together with the



<P>passionate emotions it excited? Life appears to me too short to be



<P>spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. We are, and must be,



<P>one and all, burdened with faults in this world: but the time will



<P>soon come when, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our



<P>corruptible bodies; when debasement and sin will fall from us with



<P>this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the spark of the spirit will



<P>remain,- the impalpable principle of light and thought, pure as when



<P>it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence it came it will



<P>return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than



<P>man- perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the pale



<P>human soul to brighten to the seraph! Surely it Will never, on the



<P>contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend? No; I cannot



<P>believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and



<P>which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I



<P>cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest- a



<P>mighty home, not a terror and an abyss. Besides, with this creed, I



<P>can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can



<P>so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed



<P>revenge never worries my heart, degradation never too deeply



<P>disgusts me, injustice never crushes me too low: I live in calm,



<P>looking to the end.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she



<P>finished this sentence. I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk



<P>to me, but rather to converse with her own thoughts. She was not



<P>allowed much time for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl,



<P>presently came up, exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order,

and



<P>fold up your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and



<P>look at it!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed

the



<P>monitor without reply as without delay.

CHAPTER XII</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction

to



<P>Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer



<P>acquaintance with the place and its inmates. Mrs. Fairfax turned out



<P>to be what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of



<P>competent education and average intelligence. My pupil was a lively



<P>child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes



<P>wayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no



<P>injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for



<P>her improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became



<P>obedient and teachable. She had no great talents, no marked traits



<P>of character, no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised



<P>her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had



<P>she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it. She made



<P>reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps



<P>not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle,



<P>and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of



<P>attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This, par parenthese, will be thought cool language by

persons



<P>who entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children,



<P>and the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for



<P>them an idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter



<P>parental egotism, to echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling



<P>the truth. I felt a conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and



<P>progress, and a quiet liking for her little self: just as I



<P>cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness, and



<P>a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had



<P>for me, and the moderation of her mind and character.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that,

now and



<P>then, when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down

to



<P>the gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele



<P>played with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom,



<P>I climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and



<P>having reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and



<P>hill, and along dim sky-line- that then I longed for a power of vision



<P>which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world,



<P>towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen- that then

I



<P>desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of



<P>intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character,



<P>than was here within my reach. I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax,



<P>and what was good in Adele; but I believed in the existence of other



<P>and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to



<P>behold.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Who blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called



<P>discontented. I could not help it: the restlessness was in my



<P>nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes. Then my sole relief was to



<P>walk along the corridor of the third storey, backwards and forwards,



<P>safe in the silence and solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's



<P>eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it- and,



<P>certainly, they were many and glowing; to let my heart be heaved by



<P>the exultant movement, which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded



<P>it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that



<P>was never ended- a tale my imagination created, and narrated



<P>continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire, feeling,



<P>that I desired and had not in my actual existence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied

with



<P>tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they



<P>cannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine,



<P>and millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows



<P>how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses



<P>of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm



<P>generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for



<P>their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their



<P>brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a



<P>stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded



<P>in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to



<P>confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to



<P>playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to



<P>condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn



<P>more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's

laugh:



<P>the same peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had



<P>thrilled me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her



<P>laugh. There were days when she was quite silent; but there were



<P>others when I could not account for the sounds she made. Sometimes I



<P>saw her: she would come out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or

a



<P>tray in her hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly return, generally



<P>(oh, romantic reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing



<P>a pot of porter. Her appearance always acted as a damper to the



<P>curiosity raised by her oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she



<P>had no point to which interest could attach. I made some attempts to



<P>draw her into conversation, but she seemed a person of few words: a



<P>monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other members of the household, viz., John and his

wife, Leah



<P>the housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but

in



<P>no respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and



<P>sometimes I asked her questions about her native country; but she



<P>was not of a descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such



<P>vapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than



<P>encourage inquiry.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; October, November, December passed away. One afternoon

in



<P>January, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she



<P>had a cold; and, as Adele seconded the request with an ardour that



<P>reminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my



<P>own childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in showing



<P>pliability on the point. It was a fine, calm day, though very cold;



<P>I was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long



<P>morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to



<P>be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry

it



<P>to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a pleasant winter



<P>afternoon walk. Having seen Adele comfortably seated in her little



<P>chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her best wax



<P>doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer) to



<P>play with, and a story-book for a change of amusement; and having



<P>replied to her 'Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.



<P>Jeannette,' with a kiss I set out.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely;

I



<P>walked fast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and



<P>analyse the species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and



<P>situation. It was three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed



<P>under the belfry: the charm of the hour lay in its approaching



<P>dimness, in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun. I was a mile from



<P>Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild roses in summer, for nuts and



<P>blackberries in autumn, and even now possessing a few coral



<P>treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter delight lay in its



<P>utter solitude and leafless repose. If a breath of air stirred, it



<P>made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an evergreen to



<P>rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still as



<P>the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path. Far



<P>and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now



<P>browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the



<P>hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached

the



<P>middle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field. Gathering



<P>my mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel



<P>the cold, though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice



<P>covering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had



<P>overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since. From my seat I could



<P>look down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the



<P>principal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose



<P>against the, west. I lingered till the sun went down amongst the



<P>trees, and sank crimson and clear behind them. I then turned eastward.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet

as a



<P>cloud, but brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half



<P>lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was



<P>yet a mile distant, but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly



<P>its thin murmurs of life. My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in



<P>what dales and depths I could not tell: but there were many hills



<P>beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks threading their passes. That



<P>evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the



<P>sough of the most remote.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings,

at once



<P>so far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter,



<P>which effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid



<P>mass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and



<P>strong on the foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill,



<P>sunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings

of



<P>the lane yet hid it, but it approached. I was just leaving the



<P>stile; yet, as the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by. In



<P>those days I was young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark



<P>tenanted my mind: the memories of nursery stories were there amongst



<P>other rubbish; and when they recurred, maturing youth added to them



<P>a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give. As this horse



<P>approached, and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk, I



<P>remembered certain of Bessie's tales, wherein figured a



<P>North-of-England spirit called a 'Gytrash,' which, in the form of



<P>horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and sometimes came



<P>upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition

to the



<P>tramp, tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the



<P>hazel stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made



<P>him a distinct object against the trees. It was exactly one form of



<P>Bessie's Gytrash- a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head:



<P>it passed me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with



<P>strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would.



<P>The horse followed,- a tall steed, and on its back a rider. The man,



<P>the human being, broke the spell at once. Nothing ever rode the



<P>Gytrash: it was always alone; and goblins, to my notions, though



<P>they might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet



<P>shelter in the commonplace human form. No Gytrash was this,- only a



<P>traveller taking the short cut to Millcote. He passed, and I went



<P>on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an exclamation of



<P>'What the deuce is to do now?' and a clattering tumble, arrested my



<P>attention. Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the sheet of



<P>ice which glazed the causeway. The dog came bounding back, and



<P>seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan,



<P>barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in



<P>proportion to his magnitude. He snuffed round the prostrate group, and



<P>then he ran up to me; it was all he could do,- there was no other help



<P>at hand to summon. I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller,



<P>by this time struggling himself free of his steed. His efforts were

so



<P>vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the



<P>question-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you injured, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he

was



<P>pronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me



<P>directly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can I do anything?' I asked again.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You must just stand on one side,' he answered as he rose,

first to



<P>his knees, and then to his feet. I did; whereupon began a heaving,



<P>stamping, clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying



<P>which removed me effectually some yards' distance; but I would not



<P>be driven quite away till I saw the event. This was finally fortunate;



<P>the horse was re-established, and the dog was silenced with a 'Down,



<P>Pilot!' The traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if



<P>trying whether they were sound; apparently something ailed them, for



<P>he halted to the stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious,

I think,



<P>for I now drew near him again.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some

one either



<P>from Thornfield Hall or from Hay.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,- only a

sprain;'



<P>and again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an



<P>involuntary 'Ugh!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was

waxing



<P>bright: I could see him plainly. His figure was enveloped in a



<P>riding cloak, fur collared and steel clasped; its details were not



<P>apparent, but I traced the general points of middle height and



<P>considerable breadth of chest. He had a dark face, with stern features



<P>and a heavy brow; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and



<P>thwarted just now; he was past youth, but had not reached



<P>middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five. I felt no fear of him,



<P>and but little shyness. Had he been a handsome, heroic-looking young



<P>gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus questioning him



<P>against his will, and offering my services unasked. I had hardly



<P>ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one. I had a



<P>theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,



<P>fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine



<P>shape, I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor



<P>could have sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned



<P>them as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but



<P>antipathetic.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured

to me



<P>when I addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily



<P>and with thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any



<P>vocation to renew inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the



<P>traveller, set me at my ease: I retained my station when he waved to



<P>me to go, and announced-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour,

in this



<P>solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned

his eyes



<P>in my direction before.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I should think you ought to be at home yourself,' said

he, 'if you



<P>have a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out

late when



<P>it is moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if



<P>you wish it: indeed, I am going there to post a letter.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You live just below- do you mean at that house with the



<P>battlements?' pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a



<P>hoary gleam, bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods, that,



<P>by contrast with the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whose house is it?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester's.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you know Mr. Rochester?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, I have never seen him.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is not resident, then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can you tell me where he is?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are not a servant at the hall, of course. You are-'

He



<P>stopped, ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple:



<P>a black merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine



<P>enough for a lady's-maid. He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I



<P>helped him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am the governess.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah, the governess!' he repeated; 'deuce take me, if I

had not



<P>forgotten! The governess!' and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.

In



<P>two minutes he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he



<P>tried to move.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot commission you to fetch help,' he said; 'but

you may help



<P>me a little yourself, if you will be so kind.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me:

you are



<P>not afraid?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone,

but when



<P>told to do it, I was disposed to obey. I put down my muff on the



<P>stile, and went up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the



<P>bridle, but it was a spirited thing, and would not let me come near



<P>its head; I made effort on effort, though in vain: meantime, I was



<P>mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet. The traveller waited and



<P>watched for some time, and at last he laughed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I see,' he said, 'the mountain will never be brought to

Mahomet,



<P>so all you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must



<P>beg of you to come here.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I came. 'Excuse me,' he continued: 'necessity compels me

to make



<P>you useful.' He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me



<P>with some stress, limped to his horse. Having once caught the



<P>bridle, he mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing



<P>grimly as he made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now,' said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite,

'just



<P>hand me my whip; it lies there under the hedge.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I sought it and found it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and

return as



<P>fast as you can.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and

rear,



<P>and then bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

'Like heath that, in the wilderness,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The wild wind whirls away.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I took up my muff and walked on. The incident had occurred

and



<P>was gone for me: it was an incident of no moment, no romance, no



<P>interest in a sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a



<P>monotonous life. My help had been needed and claimed; I had given



<P>it: I was pleased to have done something; trivial, transitory though



<P>the deed was, it was yet an active thing, and I was weary of an



<P>existence all passive. The new face, too, was like a new picture



<P>introduced to the gallery of memory; and it was dissimilar to all



<P>the others hanging there: firstly, because it was masculine; and,



<P>secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern. I had it still



<P>before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the



<P>post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.



<P>When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and



<P>listened, with an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway



<P>again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland



<P>dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard



<P>willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the



<P>moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among



<P>the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down

in



<P>the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught



<P>a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I



<P>hurried on.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold

was to



<P>return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome



<P>staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet



<P>tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and



<P>her only, was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my



<P>walk,- to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an



<P>uniform and too still existence; of an existence whose very privileges



<P>of security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating. What



<P>good it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the



<P>storms of an uncertain struggling life, and to have been taught by



<P>rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which I now



<P>repined! Yes, just as much good as it would do a man tired of



<P>sitting still in a 'too easy chair' to take a long walk: and just as



<P>natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances, as it would be



<P>under his.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced



<P>backwards and forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door



<P>were closed; I could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and



<P>spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house- from the grey hollow filled



<P>with rayless cells, as it appeared to me- to that sky expanded



<P>before me,- a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon



<P>ascending it in solemn march; her orb seeming to look up as she left



<P>the hill-tops, from behind which she had come, far and farther below



<P>her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless



<P>depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling stars that



<P>followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow when



<P>I viewed them. Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck in



<P>the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a



<P>side-door, and went in.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the

high-hung



<P>bronze lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the



<P>oak staircase. This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room,



<P>whose two-leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the



<P>grate, glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing



<P>purple draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant



<P>radiance. It revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had



<P>scarcely caught it, and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling



<P>of voices, amongst which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adele,



<P>when the door closed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there

too,



<P>but no candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax. Instead, all alone, sitting



<P>upright on the rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a



<P>great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the



<P>lane. It was so like it that I went forward and said- 'Pilot,' and the



<P>thing got up and came to me and snuffed me. I caressed him, and he



<P>wagged his great tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone



<P>with, and I could not tell whence he had come. I rang the bell, for



<P>I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to get an account of this



<P>visitant. Leah entered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What dog is this?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He came with master.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With whom?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With master- Mr. Rochester- he is just arrived.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and

John is gone



<P>for a surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and



<P>his ankle is sprained.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! Bring me a candle, will you, Leah?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax,

who



<P>repeated the news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and



<P>was now with Mr. Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders



<P>about tea, and I went upstairs to take off my things.

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE&nbsp; TO THE SECOND EDITION</FONT></B>

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A PREFACE to the first edition of Jane Eyre being unnecessary,

I



<P>gave none: this second edition demands a few words both of



<P>acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My thanks are due in three quarters.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to

a plain



<P>tale with few pretensions.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has

opened



<P>to an obscure aspirant.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy,

their



<P>practical sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and



<P>unrecommended Author.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Press and the Public are but vague personifications

for me, and



<P>I must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so



<P>are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only



<P>large-hearted and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling



<P>stranger; to them, i.e., to my Publishers and the select Reviewers,



<P>I say cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided

and



<P>approved me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know,



<P>but not, therefore, to be overlooked. I mean the timorous or carping



<P>few who doubt the tendency of such books as Jane Eyre: in whose eyes



<P>whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest



<P>against bigotry- that parent of crime- an insult to piety, that regent



<P>of God on earth. I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious



<P>distinctions; I would remind them of certain simple truths.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is

not



<P>religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck



<P>the mask from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand



<P>to the Crown of Thorns.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they

are as



<P>distinct as is vice from virtue. Men too often confound them: they



<P>should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth;



<P>narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few,



<P>should not be substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.



<P>There is- I repeat it- a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad



<P>action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation between



<P>them.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for

it has



<P>been accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make



<P>external show pass for sterling worth- to let white-washed walls vouch



<P>for clean shrines. It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose-



<P>to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it- to penetrate the



<P>sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is



<P>indebted to him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied

good



<P>concerning him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of



<P>Chenaanah better; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he



<P>but stopped his ears to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed

to tickle



<P>delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of



<P>society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of



<P>Judah and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as



<P>prophet-like and as vital- a mien as dauntless and as daring. Is the



<P>satirist of Vanity Fair admired in high places? I cannot tell; but I



<P>think if some of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his



<P>sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation,



<P>were to take his warnings in time- they or their seed might yet escape



<P>a fatal Ramoth-Gilead.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Why have I alluded to this man? I have alluded to him,

Reader,



<P>because I think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique



<P>than his contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as



<P>the first social regenerator of the day- as the very master of that



<P>working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped system of



<P>things; because I think no commentator on his writings has yet found



<P>the comparison that suits him, the terms which rightly characterise



<P>his talent. They say he is like Fielding: they talk of his wit,



<P>humour, comic powers. He resembles Fielding as an eagle does a



<P>vulture: Fielding could stoop on carrion, but Thackeray never does.



<P>His wit is bright, his humour attractive, but both bear the same



<P>relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent sheet-lightning



<P>playing under the edge of the summer-cloud does to the electric



<P>death-spark hid in its womb. Finally, I have alluded to Mr. Thackeray,



<P>because to him- if he will accept the tribute of a total stranger- I



<P>have dedicated this second edition of Jane Eyre.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

CHAPTER IV</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported



<P>conference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to



<P>suffice as a motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,-



<P>I desired and waited it in silence. It tarried, however: days and



<P>weeks passed: I had regained my normal state of health, but no new



<P>allusion was made to the subject over which I brooded. Mrs. Reed



<P>surveyed me at times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since



<P>my illness, she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever



<P>between me and her own children; appointing me a small closet to sleep



<P>in by myself, condemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my



<P>time in the nursery, while my cousins were constantly in the



<P>drawing-room. Not a hint, however, did she drop about sending me to



<P>school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that she would not



<P>long endure me under the same roof with her; for her glance, now



<P>more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable and rooted



<P>aversion.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders,

spoke to



<P>me as little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever



<P>he saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly



<P>turned against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and



<P>desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought

it



<P>better to desist, and ran from me uttering execrations, and vowing I



<P>had burst his nose. I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature

as



<P>hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either



<P>that or my look daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to



<P>follow up my advantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama.

I



<P>heard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how 'that nasty



<P>Jane Eyre' had flown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather



<P>harshly-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go

near her;



<P>she is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your



<P>sisters should associate with her.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly,

and



<P>without at all deliberating on my words-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They are not fit to associate with me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this

strange



<P>and audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me



<P>like a whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge

of



<P>my crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or



<P>utter one syllable during the remainder of the day.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?' was

my



<P>scarcely voluntary demand. I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed



<P>as if my tongue pronounced words, without my will consenting to



<P>their utterance: something spoke out of me over which I had no



<P>control.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What?' said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold



<P>composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took



<P>her hand from my arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know



<P>whether I were child or fiend. I was now in for it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and

think;



<P>and so can papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long,



<P>and how you wish me dead.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly,



<P>she boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie



<P>supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she



<P>proved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child



<P>ever reared under a roof. I half believed her; for I felt indeed



<P>only bad feelings surging in my breast.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; November, December, and half of January passed away. Christmas



<P>and the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual



<P>festive cheer; presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening



<P>parties given. From every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my



<P>share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of



<P>Eliza and Georgiana, and seeing them descend to the drawing-room,



<P>dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair



<P>elaborately ringleted; and afterwards, in listening to the sound of



<P>the piano or the harp played below, to the passing to and fro of the



<P>butler and footman, to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments



<P>were handed, to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing-room



<P>door opened and closed. When tired of this occupation, I would



<P>retire from the stair-head to the solitary and silent nursery:



<P>there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable. To speak truth, I had



<P>not the least wish to go into company, for in company I was very



<P>rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable, I



<P>should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with



<P>her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed,

in



<P>a room full of ladies and gentlemen. But Bessie, as soon as she had



<P>dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the lively



<P>regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing the



<P>candle along with her. I then sat with my doll on my knee till the



<P>fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing



<P>worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank



<P>to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as



<P>I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.

To



<P>this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something,



<P>and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to



<P>find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image,



<P>shabby as a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to remember with



<P>what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it



<P>alive and capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded



<P>in my night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was



<P>comparatively happy, believing it to be happy likewise.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of

the



<P>company, and listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs:



<P>sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her



<P>scissors, or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper- a bun



<P>or a cheese-cake- then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and



<P>when I had finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice



<P>she kissed me, and said, 'Good night, Miss Jane.' When thus gentle,



<P>Bessie seemed to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world;



<P>and I wished most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and



<P>amiable, and never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably,



<P>as she was too often wont to do. Bessie, Lee must, I think, have



<P>been a girl of good natural capacity, for she was smart in all she



<P>did, and had a remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge



<P>from the impression made on me by her nursery tales. She was pretty



<P>too, if my recollections of her face and person are correct. I



<P>remember her as a slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very



<P>nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she had a capricious



<P>and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or justice:



<P>still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at Gateshead



<P>Hall.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in

the morning:



<P>Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been



<P>summoned to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm



<P>garden-coat to go and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was



<P>fond: and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and



<P>hoarding up the money she thus obtained. She had a turn for traffic,



<P>and a marked propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of



<P>eggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener



<P>about flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary



<P>having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products



<P>of her parterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair



<P>off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to



<P>her money, she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or



<P>an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered



<P>by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued



<P>treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate

of



<P>interest- fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every



<P>quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the

glass,



<P>and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers,



<P>of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic. I was



<P>making my bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it



<P>arranged before she returned, (for Bessie now frequently employed me



<P>as a sort of under-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs,



<P>etc.). Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to



<P>the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll's house



<P>furniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her



<P>playthings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates



<P>and cups, were her property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for



<P>lack of other occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers



<P>with which the window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the



<P>glass through which I might look out on the grounds, where all was



<P>still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the



<P>carriage-road, and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white



<P>foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates



<P>thrown open and a carriage roll through. I watched it ascending the



<P>drive with indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none



<P>ever brought visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front

of



<P>the house, the door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.



<P>All this being nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found



<P>livelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin, which



<P>came and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed



<P>against the wall near the casement. The remains of my breakfast of



<P>bread and milk stood on the table, and having crumbled a morsel of



<P>roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the



<P>window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing

there?



<P>Have you washed your hands and face this morning?' I gave another



<P>tug before I answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its



<P>bread: the sash yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone



<P>sill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I



<P>replied-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?

You



<P>look quite red, as if you have been about some mischief: what were you



<P>opening the window for?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed

in too



<P>great a hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the



<P>washstand, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face



<P>and hands with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head



<P>with a bristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying



<P>me to the top of the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was



<P>wanted in the breakfast-room.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded

if Mrs.



<P>Reed was there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the



<P>nursery-door upon me. I slowly descended. For nearly three months, I



<P>had never been called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to



<P>the nursery, the breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become



<P>for me awful regions, on which it dismayed me to intrude.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room



<P>door, and I stopped, intimidated and trembling. What a miserable



<P>little poltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of



<P>me in those days! I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to



<P>go forward to the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation;



<P>the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I must



<P>enter.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who could want me?' I asked inwardly, as with both hands

I



<P>turned the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted



<P>my efforts. 'What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?-



<P>a man or a woman?' The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing



<P>through and curtseying low, I looked up at- a black pillar!- such,



<P>at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow,



<P>sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug: the grim face at the top



<P>was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she

made a



<P>signal to me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony



<P>stranger with the words: 'This is the little girl respecting whom I



<P>applied to you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where

I stood,



<P>and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes



<P>which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a



<P>bass voice, 'Her size is small: what is her age?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ten years.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So much?' was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his

scrutiny



<P>for some minutes. Presently he addressed me-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your name, little girl?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane Eyre, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a

tall



<P>gentleman; but then I was very little; his features were large, and



<P>they and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little

world



<P>held a contrary opinion: I was silent. Mrs. Reed answered for me by

an



<P>expressive shake of the head, adding soon, 'Perhaps the less said on



<P>that subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;'

and



<P>bending from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the



<P>arm-chair opposite Mrs. Reed's. 'Come here,' he said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight

before



<P>him. What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with



<P>mine! what a great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent



<P>teeth!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,' he began,

'especially



<P>a naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They go to hell,' was my ready and orthodox answer.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what is hell? Can you tell me that?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A pit full of fire.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning

there



<P>for ever?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What must you do to avoid it?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was



<P>objectionable: 'I must keep in good health, and not die.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How can you keep in good health? Children younger than

you die



<P>daily. I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two



<P>since,- a good little child, whose soul is now in heaven. It is to



<P>be feared the same could not be said of you were you to be called



<P>hence.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast

my eyes



<P>down on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing



<P>myself far enough away.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent

of ever



<P>having been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent



<P>benefactress.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Benefactress! benefactress!' said I inwardly: 'they all

call



<P>Mrs. Reed my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable



<P>thing.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you say your prayers night and morning?' continued

my



<P>interrogator.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you read your Bible?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sometimes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With pleasure? Are you fond of it?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis

and



<P>Samuel, and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and



<P>Chronicles, and Job and Jonah.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And the Psalms? I hope you like them?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No? oh, shocking! I have a little boy, younger than you,

who knows



<P>six Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather



<P>have, a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he



<P>says: "Oh! the verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;" says he, "I wish



<P>to be a little angel here below;" he then gets two nuts in



<P>recompense for his infant piety.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Psalms are not interesting,' I remarked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray

to God to



<P>change it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart

of



<P>stone and give you a heart of flesh.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about to propound a question, touching the manner

in which



<P>that operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs.



<P>Reed interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry



<P>on the conversation herself.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter

which I



<P>wrote to you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite



<P>the character and disposition I could wish: should you admit her



<P>into Lowood school, I should be glad if the superintendent and



<P>teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her, and, above all,



<P>to guard against her worst fault, a tendency to deceit. I mention this



<P>in your hearing, Jane, that you may not attempt to impose on Mr.



<P>Brocklehurst.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for

it was



<P>her nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence;



<P>however carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please



<P>her, my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as



<P>the above. Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to



<P>the heart; I dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope



<P>from the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I



<P>felt, though I could not have expressed the feeling, that she was



<P>sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path; I saw myself



<P>transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an artful, noxious



<P>child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing, indeed,' thought I, as I struggled to repress

a sob,



<P>and hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my



<P>anguish.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,' said Mr. Brocklehurst;



<P>'it is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the



<P>lake burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be



<P>watched, Mrs. Reed. I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting

her



<P>prospects,' continued my benefactress; 'to be made useful, to be



<P>kept humble: as for the vacations, she will, with your permission,



<P>spend them always at Lowood.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,' returned

Mr.



<P>Brocklehurst. 'Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly



<P>appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that



<P>especial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them. I



<P>have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of



<P>pride; and, only the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my



<P>success. My second daughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit



<P>the school, and on her return she exclaimed: "Oh, dear papa, how quiet



<P>and plain all the girls at Lowood look, with their hair combed



<P>behind their ears, and their long pinafores, and those little



<P>holland pockets outside their frocks- they are almost like poor



<P>people's children! and," said she, "they looked at my dress and



<P>mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before."'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This is the state of things I quite approve,' returned

Mrs.



<P>Reed; 'had I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a



<P>system more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre. Consistency, my



<P>dear Mr. Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties;

and it has



<P>been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment

of



<P>Lowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations,



<P>hardy and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and



<P>its inhabitants.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Quite right, sir. I may then depend upon this child being

received



<P>as a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her



<P>position and prospects?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of

chosen



<P>plants, and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable



<P>privilege of her election.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst;

for,



<P>I assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that



<P>was becoming too irksome.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.

I



<P>shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my



<P>good friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.

I



<P>shall send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so



<P>that there will be no difficulty about receiving her. Good-bye.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss



<P>Brocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton



<P>Brocklehurst.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will, madam. Little girl, here is a book entitled the

Child's



<P>Guide; read it with prayer, especially that part containing "An



<P>addicted to falsehood and deceit."'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin



<P>pamphlet sewn in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he



<P>departed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in

silence;



<P>she was sewing, I was watching her. Mrs. Reed might be at that time



<P>some six or seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame,



<P>square-shouldered and strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout,



<P>not obese: she had a somewhat large face, the under jaw being much



<P>developed and very solid; her brow was low, her chin large and



<P>prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under her light



<P>eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and



<P>opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was sound as a



<P>bell- illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever manager;



<P>her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control; her



<P>children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;



<P>she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off



<P>handsome attire.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair,

I



<P>examined her figure; I perused her features. In my hand I held the



<P>tract containing the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my



<P>attention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning. What had just



<P>passed; what Mrs. Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the



<P>whole tenor of their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in

my



<P>mind; I had felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly,



<P>and a passion of resentment fomented now within me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine,

her



<P>fingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Go out of the room; return to the nursery,' was her mandate.

My



<P>look or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she



<P>spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation. I got up, I went to



<P>the door; I came back again; I walked to the window, across the



<P>room, then close up to her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak I must: I had been trodden on severely, and must

turn: but



<P>how? What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist? I



<P>gathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you;

but I



<P>declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the



<P>world except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give



<P>to your girl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye

of ice



<P>continued to dwell freezingly on mine.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What more have you to say?' she asked, rather in the tone

in which



<P>a person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is



<P>ordinarily used to a child.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I

had. Shaking



<P>from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call

you



<P>aunt again so long as I live. I will never come to see you when I am



<P>grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you



<P>treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that



<P>you treated me with miserable cruelty.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth.

You



<P>think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love

or



<P>kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity. I shall remember



<P>how you thrust me back- roughly and violently thrust me back- into the



<P>red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in



<P>agony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, "Have



<P>mercy! Have mercy, Aunt Reed!" And that punishment you made me



<P>suffer because your wicked boy struck me- knocked me down for nothing.



<P>I will tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale. People



<P>think you a good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted. You are



<P>deceitful!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand,

to exult,



<P>with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It



<P>seemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out



<P>into unhoped-for liberty. Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs.



<P>Reed looked frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was



<P>lifting up her hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting



<P>her face as if she would cry.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with

you? Why do



<P>you tremble so violently? Would you like to drink some water?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, Mrs. Reed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is there anything else you wish for, Jane? I assure you,

I



<P>desire to be your friend.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character,

a



<P>deceitful disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what



<P>you are, and what you have done.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, you don't understand these things: children must

be



<P>corrected for their faults.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Deceit is not my fault!' I cried out in a savage, high

voice.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and

now



<P>return to the nursery- there's a dear- and lie down a little.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school

soon,



<P>Mrs. Reed, for I hate to live here.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will indeed send her to school soon,' murmured Mrs.

Reed sotto



<P>voce; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was left there alone- winner of the field. It was the

hardest



<P>battle I had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood



<P>awhile on the rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed



<P>my conqueror's solitude. First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but



<P>this fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated



<P>throb of my pulses. A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had



<P>done; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had



<P>given mine, without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and



<P>the chill of reaction. A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing,



<P>devouring, would have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and



<P>menaced Mrs. Reed: the same ridge, black and blasted after the



<P>flames are dead, would have represented as meetly my subsequent



<P>condition, when half an hour's silence and reflection had shown me the



<P>madness of my conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating



<P>position.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time;

as aromatic



<P>wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour,



<P>metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.



<P>Willingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I



<P>knew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was the



<P>way to make her repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting



<P>every turbulent impulse of my nature.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of

fierce



<P>speaking; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than



<P>that of sombre indignation. I took a book- some Arabian tales; I sat



<P>down and endeavoured to read. I could make no sense of the subject;

my



<P>own thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found



<P>fascinating. I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the



<P>shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun

or



<P>breeze, through the grounds. I covered my head and arms with the skirt



<P>of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which



<P>was quite sequestered; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees,



<P>the falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet



<P>leaves, swept by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together. I



<P>leaned against a gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep



<P>were feeding, where the short grass was nipped and blanched. It was



<P>a very grey day; a most opaque sky, 'onding on snaw,' canopied all;



<P>thence flakes fell at intervals, which settled on the hard path and

on



<P>the hoary lea without melting. I stood, a wretched child enough,



<P>whispering to myself over and over again, 'What shall I do?- what



<P>shall I do?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All at once I heard a clear voice call, 'Miss Jane! where

are



<P>you? Come to lunch!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir;

her light



<P>step came tripping down the path.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You naughty little thing!' she said. 'Why don't you come

when



<P>you are called?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which

I had been



<P>brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat



<P>cross. The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed,



<P>I was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory



<P>anger; and I was disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of



<P>heart. I just put my two arms round her and said, 'Come, Bessie! don't



<P>scold.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated

to



<P>indulge in: somehow it pleased her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are a strange child, Miss Jane,' she said, as she

looked



<P>down at me; 'a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to



<P>school, I suppose?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I nodded.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What does Bessie care for me? She is always scolding me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.

You



<P>should be bolder.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What! to get more knocks?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nonsense! But you are rather put upon, that's certain.

My mother



<P>said, when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a



<P>little one of her own to be in your place.- Now, come in, and I've



<P>some good news for you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't think you have, Bessie.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Child! what do you mean? What sorrowful eyes you fix on

me!



<P>Well, but Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out

to



<P>tea this afternoon, and you shall have tea with me. I'll ask cook to



<P>bake you a little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your



<P>drawers; for I am soon to pack your trunk. Missis intends you to leave



<P>Gateshead in a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like



<P>to take with you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till

I go.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't

be



<P>afraid of me. Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply;



<P>it's so provoking.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie,

because



<P>I have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people

to



<P>dread.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you dread them they'll dislike you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'As you do, Bessie?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't dislike you, Miss: I believe I am fonder of you

than of



<P>all the others.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You don't show it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of

talking.



<P>What makes you so venturesome and hardy?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides'- I was

going to



<P>say something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on



<P>second thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And so you're glad to leave me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just now! and rather! How coolly my little lady says it!

I daresay



<P>now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say



<P>you'd rather not.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.' Bessie

stooped;



<P>we mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite



<P>comforted. That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the



<P>evening Bessie told me some of her most enchaining stories, and sang



<P>me some of her sweetest songs. Even for me life had its gleams of



<P>sunshine.

CHAPTER X</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; HITHERTO I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant



<P>existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as



<P>many chapters. But this is not to be a regular autobiography: I am



<P>only bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess



<P>some degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years



<P>almost in silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links



<P>of connection.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation

at



<P>Lowood, it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its



<P>virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention



<P>on the school. Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge, and

by



<P>degrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a



<P>high degree. The unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and



<P>quality of the children's food; the brackish, fetid water used in



<P>its preparation; the pupils' wretched clothing and accommodations- all



<P>these things were discovered, and the discovery produced a result



<P>mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but beneficial to the institution.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county

subscribed



<P>largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better



<P>situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and



<P>clothing introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the



<P>management of a committee. Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth



<P>and family connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the



<P>post of treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties



<P>by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his



<P>office of inspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to



<P>combine reason with strictness, comfort with economy, compassion



<P>with uprightness. The school, thus improved, became in time a truly



<P>useful and noble institution. I remained an inmate of its walls, after



<P>its regeneration, for eight years: six as pupil, and two as teacher;



<P>and in both capacities I bear my testimony to its value and



<P>importance.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy,



<P>because it was not inactive. I had the means of an excellent education



<P>placed within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a



<P>desire to excel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my



<P>teachers, especially such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself



<P>fully of the advantages offered me. In time I rose to be the first



<P>girl of the first class; then I was invested with the office of



<P>teacher; which I discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end

of



<P>that time I altered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued



<P>superintendent of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best



<P>part of my acquirements; her friendship and society had been my



<P>continual solace; she had stood me in the stead of mother,



<P>governess, and, latterly, companion. At this period she married,



<P>removed with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy



<P>of such a wife) to a distant county, and consequently was lost to me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her

was gone



<P>every settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in



<P>some degree a home to me. I had imbibed from her something of her



<P>nature and much of her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed



<P>better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind. I had



<P>given in allegiance to duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was



<P>content: to the eyes of others, usually even to my own, I appeared a



<P>disciplined and subdued character.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came

between



<P>me and Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a



<P>post-chaise, shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise



<P>mount the hill and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my



<P>own room, and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the



<P>half-holiday granted in honour of the occasion.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked about the chamber most of the time. I imagined

myself only



<P>to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my



<P>reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the



<P>afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned



<P>on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming



<P>process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss



<P>Temple- or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere



<P>I had been breathing in her vicinity- and that now I was left in my



<P>natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions.



<P>It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive



<P>were gone: it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me,



<P>but the reason for tranquillity was no more. My world had for some



<P>years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems;



<P>now I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field



<P>of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who



<P>had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of



<P>life amidst its perils.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to my window, opened it, and looked out. There were

the



<P>two wings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts



<P>of Lowood; there was the hilly horizon. My eye passed all other



<P>objects to rest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I



<P>longed to surmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed



<P>prison-ground, exile limits. I traced the white road winding round the



<P>base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I



<P>longed to follow it farther! I recalled the time when I had



<P>travelled that very road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill



<P>at twilight; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought



<P>me first to Lowood, and I had never quitted it since. My vacations had



<P>all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to



<P>Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit



<P>me. I had had no communication by letter or message with the outer



<P>world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and



<P>voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and



<P>antipathies- such was what I knew of existence. And now I felt that

it



<P>was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in one



<P>afternoon. I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I



<P>uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly



<P>blowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change,



<P>stimulus: that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space:



<P>'Then,' I cried, half desperate, 'grant me at least a new servitude!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections



<P>till bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me



<P>kept me from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged



<P>effusion of small talk. How I wished sleep would silence her. It



<P>seemed as if, could I but go back to the idea which had last entered



<P>my mind as I stood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise



<P>for my relief.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welsh-woman,

and till



<P>now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any



<P>other light than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes



<P>with satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my



<P>half-effaced thought instantly revived.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A new servitude! There is something in that,' I soliloquised



<P>(mentally, be it understood; I did not talk aloud). 'I know there



<P>is, because it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words



<P>as Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no



<P>more than sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere



<P>waste of time to listen to them. But Servitude! That must be matter

of



<P>fact. Any one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I



<P>want is to serve elsewhere. Can I not get so much of my own will? Is



<P>not the thing feasible? Yes- yes- the end is not so difficult; if I



<P>had only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining



<P>it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it

was a chilly



<P>night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded to



<P>think again with all my might.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do I want? A new place, in a new house, amongst new

faces,



<P>under new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting



<P>anything better. How do people do to get a new place? They apply to



<P>friends, I suppose: I have no friends. There are many others who



<P>have no friends, who must look about for themselves and be their own



<P>helpers; and what is their resource?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my

brain to



<P>find a response, and quickly. It worked and worked faster: I felt



<P>the pulses throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it



<P>worked in chaos; and no result came of its efforts. Feverish with vain



<P>labour, I got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain,



<P>noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required



<P>suggestion on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and



<P>naturally to my mind:- 'Those who want situations advertise; you



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How? I know nothing about advertising.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Replies rose smooth and prompt now:-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay

for it



<P>under a cover directed to the editor of the Herald; you must put it,



<P>the first opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers



<P>must be addressed to J. E., at the post-office there; you can go and



<P>inquire in about a week after you send your letter, if any are come,



<P>and act accordingly.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested

in my



<P>mind; I had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell



<P>asleep.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written,



<P>enclosed, and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it



<P>ran thus:-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A young lady accustomed to tuition' (had I not been a

teacher



<P>two years?) 'is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private



<P>family where the children are under fourteen' (I thought that as I was



<P>barely eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils



<P>nearer my own age). 'She is qualified to teach the usual branches of

a



<P>good English education, together with French, Drawing, and Music'



<P>(in those days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of



<P>accomplishments, would have been held tolerably comprehensive).



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after

tea, I



<P>asked leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to



<P>perform some small commissions for myself and one or two of my



<P>fellow-teachers; permission was readily granted; I went. It was a walk



<P>of two miles, and the evening was wet, but the days were still long;

I



<P>visited a shop or two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and



<P>came back through heavy rain, with streaming garments, but with a



<P>relieved heart.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last,



<P>however, like all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close



<P>of a pleasant autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to



<P>Lowton. A picturesque track it was, by the way; lying along the side



<P>of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale: but that



<P>day I thought more of the letters, that might or might not be awaiting



<P>me at the little burgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of



<P>lea and water.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured

for a



<P>pair of shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was



<P>done, I stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the



<P>shoemaker's to the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore



<P>horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are there any letters for J. E.?' I asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened

a



<P>drawer and fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that

my



<P>hopes began to falter. At last, having held a document before her



<P>glasses for nearly five minutes, she presented it across the



<P>counter, accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful



<P>glance- it was for J. E.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is there only one?' I demanded.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There are no more,' said she; and I put it in my pocket

and turned



<P>my face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be



<P>back by eight, and it was already half-past seven.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Various duties awaited me on my arrival: I had to sit with

the



<P>girls during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers;



<P>to see them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.



<P>Even when we finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss



<P>Gryce was still my companion: we had only a short end of candle in our



<P>candlestick, and I dreaded lest she should talk till it was all



<P>burnt out; fortunately, however, the heavy supper she had eaten



<P>produced a soporific effect: she was already snoring before I had



<P>finished undressing. There still remained an inch of candle: I now



<P>took out my letter; the seal was an initial F.; I broke it; the



<P>contents were brief.



<P>Thursday, possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a



<P>position to give satisfactory references as to character and



<P>competency, a situation can be offered her where there is but one



<P>pupil, a little girl, under ten years of age; and where the salary



<P>is thirty pounds per annum. J. E. is requested to send references,



<P>name, address, and all particulars to the direction:-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned

and



<P>rather uncertain, like that of an elderly lady. This circumstance



<P>was satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting



<P>for myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into



<P>some scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my



<P>endeavours to be respectable, proper, en regle. I now felt that an



<P>elderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business I had on hand. Mrs.



<P>Fairfax! I saw her in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps,



<P>but not uncivil: a model of elderly English respectability.



<P>Thornfield! that, doubtless, was the name of her house: a neat orderly



<P>spot, I was sure; though I failed in my efforts to conceive a



<P>recollections of the map of England; yes, I saw it; both the shire and



<P>county where I now resided: that was a recommendation to me. I



<P>longed to go where there was life and movement: Millcote was a large



<P>doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete change at least.



<P>Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and



<P>clouds of smoke- 'but,' I argued, 'Thornfield will, probably, be a



<P>good way from the town.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went

out.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no

longer be



<P>confined to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve



<P>their success. Having sought and obtained an audience of the



<P>superintendent during the noontide recreation, I told her I had a



<P>prospect of getting a new situation where the salary would be double



<P>what I now received (for at Lowood I only got L15 per annum); and



<P>requested she would break the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or



<P>some of the committee, and ascertain whether they would permit me to



<P>mention them as references. She obligingly consented to act as



<P>mediatrix in the matter. The next day she laid the affair before Mr.



<P>Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be written to, as she was



<P>my natural guardian. A note was accordingly addressed to that lady,



<P>who returned for answer, that 'I might do as I pleased: she had long



<P>relinquished all interference in my affairs.' This note went the round



<P>of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to me most



<P>tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition if I



<P>could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself



<P>well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character



<P>and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should



<P>forthwith be furnished me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month,

forwarded



<P>a copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating



<P>that she was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period



<P>for my assuming the post of governess in her house.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed



<P>rapidly. I had not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to

my



<P>wants; and the last day sufficed to pack my trunk,- the same I had



<P>brought with me eight years ago from Gateshead.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The box was corded, the card nailed on. In half an hour

the carrier



<P>was to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to



<P>repair at an early hour the next morning to meet the coach. I had



<P>brushed my black stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves,



<P>and muff; sought in all my drawers to see that no article was left



<P>behind; and now having nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to



<P>rest. I could not; though I had been on foot all day, I could not



<P>now repose an instant; I was too much excited. A phase of my life



<P>was closing tonight, a new one opening to-morrow: impossible to



<P>slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly while the change



<P>was being accomplished.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss,' said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I

was



<P>wandering like a troubled spirit, 'a person below wishes to see you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The carrier, no doubt,' I thought, and ran downstairs

without



<P>inquiry. I was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the



<P>door of which was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran



<P>out-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It's her, I am sure!- I could have told her anywhere!'

cried the



<P>individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant,



<P>matronly, yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and



<P>eyes, and lively complexion.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, who is it?' she asked, in a voice and with a smile

I half



<P>recognised; 'you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously:



<P>'Bessie! Bessie! Bessie!' that was all I said; whereat she half



<P>laughed, half cried, and we both went into the parlour. By the fire



<P>stood a little fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is my little boy,' said Bessie directly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you are married, Bessie?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman;

and



<P>I've a little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you don't live at Gateshead?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I live at the lodge: the old porter has left.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, and how do they all get on? Tell me everything about

them,



<P>Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee,



<P>will you?' but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very

stout,'



<P>continued Mrs. Leaven. 'I daresay they've not kept you too well at



<P>school: Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and



<P>Miss Georgiana would make two of you in breadth.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very. She went up to London last winter with her mama,

and there



<P>everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his



<P>relations were against the match; and- what do you think?- he and Miss



<P>Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.



<P>It was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and



<P>now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are



<P>always quarrelling.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, and what of John Reed?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish. He

went to



<P>college, and he got- plucked, I think they call it: and then his



<P>uncles wanted him to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such



<P>a dissipated young man, they will never make much of him, I think.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What does he look like?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young

man;



<P>but he has such thick lips.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And Mrs. Reed?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I

think



<P>she's not quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please



<P>her- he spends a deal of money.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did she send you here, Bessie?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when

I heard



<P>that there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to



<P>another part of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a



<P>look at you before you were quite out of my reach.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.' I said

this



<P>laughing: I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed



<P>regard, did in no shape denote admiration.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you

look



<P>like a lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were



<P>no beauty as a child.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct,



<P>but I confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen



<P>most people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an



<P>exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but



<P>gratification.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I daresay you are clever, though,' continued Bessie, by

way of



<P>solace. 'What can you do? Can you play on the piano?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A little.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and

then



<P>asked me to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and



<P>she was charmed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The Miss Reeds could not play as well!' said she exultingly.

'I



<P>always said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.' It

was a



<P>landscape in water colours, of which I had made a present to the



<P>superintendent, in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the



<P>committee on my behalf, and which she had framed and glazed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane! It is as fine a picture

as any



<P>Miss Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies



<P>themselves, who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you can work on muslin and canvas?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I can.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would

be: you will



<P>get on whether your relations notice you or not. There was something

I



<P>wanted to ask you. Have you ever heard anything from your father's



<P>kinsfolk, the Eyres?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never in my life.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, you know, Missis always said they were poor and

quite



<P>despicable: and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much



<P>gentry as the Reeds are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr.



<P>Eyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see you; Missis said you were



<P>at school fifty miles off; he seemed so much disappointed, for he



<P>could not stay: he was going on a voyage to a foreign country, and the



<P>ship was to sail from London in a day or two. He looked quite a



<P>gentleman, and I believe he was your father's brother.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine-

the butler



<P>did tell me-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madeira?' I suggested.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, that is it- that is the very word.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So he went?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis

was very



<P>high with him; she called him afterwards a "sneaking tradesman." My



<P>Robert believes he was a wine-merchant.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Very likely,' I returned; 'or perhaps clerk or agent to

a



<P>wine-merchant.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer,

and then she



<P>was obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next



<P>morning at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach. We parted



<P>finally at the door of the Brocklehurst Arms there, each went her



<P>separate way; she set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the



<P>conveyance which was to take her back to Gateshead, I mounted the



<P>vehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the



<P>unknown environs of Millcote.

CHAPTER XXXVIII&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONCLUSION</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; READER, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I,

the parson



<P>and clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I went



<P>into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner



<P>and John cleaning the knives, and I said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning.'

The



<P>housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic



<P>order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a



<P>remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having



<P>one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation, and subsequently



<P>stunned by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she



<P>did stare at me: the ladle with which she was basting a pair of



<P>chickens roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang



<P>suspended in air; and for the same space of time John's knives also



<P>had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending again over



<P>the roast, said only-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you, Miss? Well, for sure!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A short time after she pursued- 'I seed you go out with

the master,



<P>but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;' and she basted



<P>away. John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I telled Mary how it would be,' he said: 'I knew what

Mr.



<P>Edward' (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he was



<P>the cadet of the house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian



<P>name)- 'I knew what Mr. Edward would do; and I was certain he would



<P>not wait long neither: and he's done right, for aught I know. I wish



<P>you joy, Miss!' and he politely pulled his forelock.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you, John. Mr. Rochester told me to give you and

Mary this.'



<P>I put into his hand a five-pound note. Without waiting to hear more,

I



<P>left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time after,



<P>I caught the words-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She'll happen do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.'

And



<P>again, 'If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and



<P>varry good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may



<P>see that.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to

say what I



<P>had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and Mary



<P>approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she would just



<P>give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and



<P>see me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She had better not wait till then, Jane,' said Mr. Rochester,

when



<P>I read her letter to him; 'if she does, she will be too late, for



<P>our honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade



<P>over your grave or mine.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never

answered the



<P>letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to



<P>me, without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to



<P>my marriage. His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.



<P>He has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence



<P>ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live



<P>without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?

I



<P>had not; I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and



<P>see her at the school where he had placed her. Her frantic joy at



<P>beholding me again moved me much. She looked pale and thin: she said



<P>she was not happy. I found the rules of the establishment were too



<P>strict, its course of study too severe for a child of her age: I



<P>took her home with me. I meant to become her governess once more,



<P>but I soon found this impracticable; my time and cares were now



<P>required by another- my husband needed them all. So I sought out a



<P>school conducted on a more indulgent system, and near enough to permit



<P>of my visiting her often, and bringing her home sometimes. I took care



<P>she should never want for anything that could contribute to her



<P>comfort: she soon settled in her new abode, became very happy there,



<P>and made fair progress in her studies. As she grew up, a sound English



<P>education corrected in a great measure her French defects; and when



<P>she left school, I found in her a pleasing and obliging companion:



<P>docile, good-tempered, and well-principled. By her grateful



<P>attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any little



<P>kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience

of



<P>married life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose



<P>names have most frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have



<P>done.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have now been married ten years. I know what it is to

live



<P>entirely for and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself



<P>supremely blest- blest beyond what language can express; because I



<P>am my husband's life as fully as he is mine. No woman was ever



<P>nearer to her mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone



<P>and flesh of his flesh. I know no weariness of my Edward's society:

he



<P>knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the



<P>heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever



<P>together. To be together is for us to be at once as free as in



<P>solitude, as gay as in company. We talk, I believe, all day long: to



<P>talk to each other is but a more animated and an audible thinking. All



<P>my confidence is bestowed on him, all his confidence is devoted to me;



<P>we are precisely suited in character-perfect concord is the result.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our

union:



<P>perhaps it was that circumstance that drew us so very near- that



<P>knit us so very close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his



<P>right hand. Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of



<P>his eye. He saw nature- he saw books through me; and never did I weary



<P>of gazing for his behalf, and of putting into words the effect of



<P>field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam- of the landscape before



<P>us; of the weather round us- and impressing by sound on his ear what



<P>light could no longer stamp on his eye. Never did I weary of reading



<P>to him; never did I weary of conducting him where he wished to go:



<P>of doing for him what he wished to be done. And there was a pleasure



<P>in my services, most full, most exquisite, even though sad- because

he



<P>claimed these services without painful shame or damping humiliation.



<P>He loved me so truly, that he knew no reluctance in profiting by my



<P>attendance: he felt I loved him so fondly, that to yield that



<P>attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing

a



<P>letter to his dictation, he came and bent over me, and said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, have you a glittering ornament round your neck?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a gold watch-chain: I answered 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And have you a pale-blue dress on?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had. He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied

the



<P>obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he



<P>was sure of it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He and I went up to London. He had the advice of an eminent



<P>oculist; and he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye. He



<P>cannot now see very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he



<P>can find his way without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer

a



<P>blank to him- the earth no longer a void. When his first-born was



<P>put into his arms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own



<P>eyes, as they once were- large, brilliant, and black. On that



<P>occasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had



<P>tempered judgment with mercy.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because

those we



<P>most love are happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both



<P>married: alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we



<P>go to see them. Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant



<P>officer and a good man. Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her



<P>brother's, and, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the



<P>connection. Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives,



<P>and are loved by them.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.

He



<P>entered on the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.



<P>A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks



<P>and dangers. Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal,



<P>and truth, he labours for his race; he clears their painful way to



<P>improvement; he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and



<P>caste that encumber it. He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may

be



<P>ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who



<P>guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon. His is the



<P>exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says-



<P>'Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his



<P>cross and follow me.' His is the ambition of the high master-spirit,



<P>which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed



<P>from the earth- who stand without fault before the throne of God,



<P>who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb, who are called, and



<P>chosen, and faithful.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself

has



<P>hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close:



<P>his glorious sun hastens to its setting. The last letter I received



<P>from him drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with



<P>divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.

I



<P>know that a stranger's hand will write to me next, to say that the



<P>good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of



<P>his Lord. And why weep for this? No fear of death will darken St.



<P>John's last hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart will be



<P>undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith steadfast. His own words



<P>are a pledge of this-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My Master,' he says, 'has forewarned me. Daily He announces

more



<P>distinctly,- "Surely I come quickly!" and hourly I more eagerly



<P>respond,- "Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!"'

CHAPTER XI</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A NEW chapter in a novel is something like a new scene

in a play;



<P>and when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you



<P>see a room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured



<P>papering on the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such



<P>furniture, such ornaments on the mantel-piece, such prints,



<P>including a portrait of George the Third, and another of the Prince

of



<P>Wales, and a representation of the death of Wolfe. All this is visible



<P>to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by



<P>that of an excellent fire, near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet;

my



<P>muff and umbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness



<P>and chill contracted by sixteen hours' exposure to the rawness of an



<P>October day: I left Lowton at four o'clock A.M., and the Millcote town



<P>clock is now just striking eight.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not

very



<P>tranquil in my mind. I thought when the coach stopped here there would



<P>be some one to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the



<P>wooden steps the 'boots' placed for my convenience, expecting to



<P>hear my name pronounced, and to see some description of carriage



<P>waiting to convey me to Thornfield. Nothing of the sort was visible;



<P>and when I asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a



<P>Miss Eyre, I was answered in the negative: so I had no resource but

to



<P>request to be shown into a private room: and here I am waiting,



<P>while all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling my thoughts.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to

feel



<P>itself quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection,



<P>uncertain whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and



<P>prevented by many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.



<P>The charm of adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride



<P>warms it; but then the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me



<P>became predominant when half an hour elapsed and still I was alone.



<P>I bethought myself to ring the bell.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?'

I asked



<P>of the waiter who answered the summons.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thornfield? I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar.'

He



<P>vanished, but reappeared instantly-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is your name Eyre, Miss?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Person here waiting for you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into

the



<P>inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the



<P>lamp-lit street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This will be your luggage, I suppose?' said the man rather



<P>abruptly when he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.' He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort

of car,



<P>and then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was

to



<P>Thornfield.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A matter of six miles.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How long shall we be before we get there?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Happen an hour and a half.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside,

and we



<P>set off. Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to



<P>reflect; I was content to be at length so near the end of my



<P>journey; and as I leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant



<P>conveyance, I meditated much at my ease.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I suppose,' thought I, 'judging from the plainness of

the



<P>servant and carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so



<P>much the better; I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was



<P>very miserable with them. I wonder if she lives alone except this



<P>little girl; if so, and if she is in any degree amiable, I shall



<P>surely be able to get on with her; I will do my best; it is a pity



<P>that doing one's best does not always answer. At Lowood, indeed, I



<P>took that resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with



<P>Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always spurned with scorn. I pray



<P>God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if she does,



<P>I am not bound to stay with her! let the worst come to the worst, I



<P>can advertise again. How far are we on our road now, I wonder?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind

us;



<P>judging by the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable



<P>magnitude, much larger than Lowton. We were now, as far as I could



<P>see, on a sort of common; but there were houses scattered all over the



<P>district; I felt we were in a different region to Lowood, more



<P>populous, less picturesque; more stirring, less romantic.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let

his horse



<P>walk all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily



<P>believe, to two hours; at last he turned in his seat and said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its

low broad



<P>tower against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a



<P>narrow galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or



<P>hamlet. About ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair



<P>of gates: we passed through, and they clashed to behind us. We now



<P>slowly ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a house:



<P>candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were



<P>dark. The car stopped at the front door; it was opened by a



<P>maid-servant; I alighted and went in.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will you walk this way, ma'am?' said the girl; and I followed



<P>her across a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me



<P>into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first



<P>dazzled me, contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes



<P>had been for two hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and



<P>agreeable picture presented itself to my view.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an

arm-chair



<P>high-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable



<P>little elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin



<P>apron; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately



<P>and milder looking. She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat



<P>demurely at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the



<P>beau-ideal of domestic comfort. A more reassuring introduction for a



<P>new governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to



<P>overwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the



<P>old lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How do you do, my dear? I am afraid you have had a tedious

ride;



<P>John drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?' said I.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, you are right: do sit down.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove

my



<P>shawl and untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself



<P>so much trouble.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, it is no trouble; I daresay your own hands are almost

numbed



<P>with cold. Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two:



<P>here are the keys of the storeroom.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch

of



<P>keys, and delivered them to the servant.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,' she continued. 'You've



<P>brought your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, ma'am.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll see it carried into your room,' she said, and bustled

out.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She treats me like a visitor,' thought I. 'I little expected



<P>such a reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is



<P>not like what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must



<P>not exult too soon.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus

and



<P>a book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now



<P>brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments. I felt rather



<P>confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever



<P>before received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but



<P>as she did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out



<P>of her place, I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?'

I



<P>asked, when I had partaken of what she offered me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What did you say, my dear? I am a little deaf,' returned

the



<P>good lady, approaching her ear to my mouth.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I repeated the question more distinctly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Fairfax? Oh, you mean Miss Varens! Varens is the

name of your



<P>future pupil.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed! Then she is not your daughter?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No,- I have no family.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in

what way



<P>Miss Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not



<P>polite to ask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am so glad,' she continued, as she sat down opposite

to me,



<P>and took the cat on her knee; 'I am so glad you are come; it will be



<P>quite pleasant living here now with a companion. To be sure it is



<P>pleasant at any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather



<P>neglected of late years perhaps, but still it is a respectable



<P>place; yet you know in winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the



<P>best quarters. I say alone- Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John



<P>and his wife are very decent people; but then you see they are only



<P>servants, and one can't converse with them on terms of equality: one



<P>must keep them at due distance, for fear of losing one's authority.



<P>I'm sure last winter (it was a very severe one, if you recollect,



<P>and when it did not snow, it rained and blew), not a creature but



<P>the butcher and postman came to the house, from November till



<P>February; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night after



<P>night alone; I had Leah in to read to me sometimes; but I don't



<P>think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt it confining. In



<P>spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long days make



<P>such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this



<P>autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a



<P>house alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her

talk;



<P>and I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere



<P>wish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night,' said

she; 'it



<P>is on the stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all



<P>day: you must feel tired. If you have got your feet well warmed,



<P>I'll show you your bedroom. I've had the room next to mine prepared



<P>for you; it is only a small apartment, but I thought you would like

it



<P>better than one of the large front chambers: to be sure they have



<P>finer furniture, but they are so dreary and solitary, I never sleep

in



<P>them myself.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really

felt



<P>fatigued with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire. She



<P>took her candle, and I followed her from the room. First she went to



<P>see if the hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock,



<P>she led the way upstairs. The steps and banisters were of oak; the



<P>staircase window was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery



<P>into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a



<P>church rather than a house. A very chill and vault-like air pervaded



<P>the stairs and gallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and



<P>solitude; and I was glad, when finally ushered into my chamber, to



<P>find it of small dimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and

I had



<P>fastened my door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced



<P>the eerie impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious



<P>staircase, and that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my



<P>little room, I remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and



<P>mental anxiety, I was now at last in safe haven. The impulse of



<P>gratitude swelled my heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and



<P>offered up thanks where thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose,



<P>to implore aid on my further path, and the power of meriting the



<P>kindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned. My



<P>couch had no thorns in it that night; my solitary room no fears. At



<P>once weary and content, I slept soon and soundly: when I awoke it



<P>was broad day.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as

the sun



<P>shone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing



<P>papered walls and a carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and



<P>stained plaster of Lowood, that my spirits rose at the view. Externals



<P>have a great effect on the young: I thought that a fairer era of



<P>life was beginning for me- one that was to have its flowers and



<P>pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils. My faculties, roused by



<P>the change of scene, the new field offered to hope, seemed all



<P>astir. I cannot precisely define what they expected, but it was



<P>something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at an



<P>indefinite future period.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain-

for I



<P>had no article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity-



<P>I was still by nature solicitous to be neat. It was not my habit to

be



<P>disregardful of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on



<P>the contrary, I ever wished to look as well as I could, and to



<P>please as much as my want of beauty would permit. I sometimes



<P>regretted that I was not handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy



<P>cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall,



<P>stately, and finely developed in figure; I felt it a misfortune that

I



<P>was so little, so pale, and had features so irregular and so marked.



<P>And why had I these aspirations and these regrets? It would be



<P>difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say it to myself; yet



<P>I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too. However, when I had



<P>brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black frock- which,



<P>Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety-



<P>and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do



<P>respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new



<P>pupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy. Having



<P>opened my chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and



<P>neat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the

slippery



<P>steps of oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I



<P>looked at some pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a



<P>grim man in a cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl



<P>necklace), at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock



<P>whose case was of oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and



<P>rubbing. Everything appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then



<P>I was so little accustomed to grandeur. The hall-door, which was



<P>half of glass, stood open; I stepped over the threshold. It was a fine



<P>autumn morning; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and



<P>still green fields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed



<P>the front of the mansion. It was three storeys high, of proportions



<P>not vast, though considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a



<P>nobleman's seat: battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.



<P>Its grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery,



<P>whose cawing tenants were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and



<P>grounds to alight in a great meadow, from which these were separated



<P>by a sunk fence, and where an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong,



<P>knotty, and broad as oaks, at once explained the etymology of the



<P>mansion's designation. Farther off were hills: not so lofty as those



<P>round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so like barriers of separation from



<P>the living world; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming



<P>to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I had not expected to find



<P>existent so near the stirring locality of Millcote. A little hamlet,



<P>whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled up the side of one of



<P>these hills; the church of the district stood nearer Thornfield: its



<P>old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh

air, yet



<P>listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the



<P>wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it



<P>was for one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that



<P>lady appeared at the door.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What! out already?' said she. 'I see you are an early

riser.' I



<P>went up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the



<P>hand.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How do you like Thornfield?' she asked. I told her I liked

it very



<P>much.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' she said, 'it is a pretty place; but I fear it will

be



<P>getting out of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his



<P>head to come and reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it



<P>rather oftener: great houses and fine grounds require the presence



<P>of the proprietor.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester!' I exclaimed. 'Who is he?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The owner of Thornfield,' she responded quietly. 'Did

you not know



<P>he was called Rochester?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I did not- I had never heard of him before; but

the old



<P>lady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood



<P>fact, with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I thought,' I continued, 'Thornfield belonged to you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To me? Bless you, child; what an idea! To me! I am only

the



<P>housekeeper- the manager. To be sure I am distantly related to the



<P>Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was



<P>a clergyman, incumbent of Hay- that little village yonder on the hill-



<P>and that church near the gates was his. The present Mr. Rochester's



<P>mother was a Fairfax, second cousin to my husband: but I never presume



<P>on the connection- in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself



<P>quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always



<P>civil, and I expect nothing more.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And the little girl- my pupil!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find

a



<P>believe. Here she comes, with her "bonne," as she calls her nurse.'



<P>The enigma then was explained: this affable and kind little widow



<P>was no great dame; but a dependant like myself. I did not like her the



<P>worse for that; on the contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.



<P>The equality between her and me was real; not the mere result of



<P>condescension on her part: so much the better- my position was all the



<P>freer.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed

by



<P>her attendant, came running up the lawn. I looked at my pupil, who did



<P>not at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven



<P>or eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured



<P>face, and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good morning, Miss Adela,' said Mrs. Fairfax. 'Come and

speak to



<P>the lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some



<P>day.' She approached.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'C'est la ma gouvernante!' said she, pointing to me, and

addressing



<P>her nurse; who answered-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mais oui, certainement.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are they foreigners?' I inquired, amazed at hearing the

French



<P>language.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent;



<P>and, I believe, never left it till within six months ago. When she



<P>first came here she could speak no English; now she can make shift



<P>to talk it a little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with



<P>French; but you will make out her meaning very well, I daresay.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French

by a



<P>French lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with



<P>Madame Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last



<P>seven years, learnt a portion of French by heart daily- applying



<P>myself to take pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as



<P>possible the pronunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain



<P>degree of readiness and correctness in the language, and was not



<P>likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela. She came and



<P>shook hands with me when she heard that I was her governess; and as



<P>I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to her in her



<P>own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were seated



<P>at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her



<P>large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah!' cried she, in French, 'you speak my language as well

as Mr.



<P>Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can



<P>Sophie. She will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame



<P>Fairfax is all English. Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over



<P>the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked- how it did smoke!-



<P>and I was sick, and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester. Mr.



<P>Rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and



<P>Sophie and I had little beds in another place. I nearly fell out of



<P>mine; it was like a shelf. And Mademoiselle- what is your name?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Eyre- Jane Eyre.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Aire? Bah! I cannot say it. Well, our ship stopped in

the morning,



<P>before it was quite daylight, at a great city- a huge city, with



<P>very dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean



<P>town I came from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a



<P>plank to the land, and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach,



<P>which took us to a beautiful large house, larger than this and



<P>finer, called an hotel. We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie



<P>used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called



<P>the Park; and there were many children there besides me, and a pond



<P>with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?' asked

Mrs.



<P>Fairfax.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to

the fluent



<P>tongue of Madame Pierrot.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I wish,' continued the good lady, 'you would ask her a

question or



<P>two about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Adele,' I inquired, 'with whom did you live when you were

in



<P>that pretty clean town you spoke of?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy

Virgin.



<P>Mama used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses. A great



<P>many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before



<P>them, or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it. Shall I



<P>let you hear me sing now?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give

a



<P>specimen of her accomplishments. Descending from her chair, she came



<P>and placed herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely



<P>before her, shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the



<P>ceiling, she commenced singing a song from some opera. It was the



<P>strain of a forsaken lady, who, after bewailing the perfidy of her



<P>lover, calls pride to her aid; desires her attendant to deck her in



<P>her brightest jewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false



<P>one that night at a ball, and prove to him, by the gaiety of her



<P>demeanour, how little his desertion has affected her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer;

but I



<P>suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love



<P>and jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste



<P>that point was: at least I thought so.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the

naivete of



<P>her age. This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, 'Now,



<P>Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming an attitude, she began 'La Ligue des Rats: fable

de La



<P>Fontaine.' She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to



<P>punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an



<P>appropriateness of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and



<P>which proved she had been carefully trained.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Was it your mama who taught you that piece?' I asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: "Qu'avez

vous



<P>donc? lui dit un de ces rats; parlez!" She made me lift my hand- so-



<P>to remind me to raise my voice at the question. Now shall I dance



<P>for you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy

Virgin,



<P>as you say, with whom did you live then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of

me, but she



<P>is nothing related to me. I think she is poor, for she had not so fine



<P>a house as mama. I was not long there. Mr. Rochester asked me if I



<P>would like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I



<P>knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always



<P>kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not



<P>kept his word, for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone



<P>back again himself, and I never see him.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which

room,



<P>it appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the



<P>schoolroom. Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but



<P>there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be



<P>needed in the way of elementary works, and several volumes of light



<P>literature, poetry, biography, travels, a few romances, etc. I suppose



<P>he had considered that these were all the governess would require



<P>for her private perusal; and, indeed, they contented me amply for



<P>the present; compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been



<P>able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of



<P>entertainment and information. In this room, too, there was a



<P>cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone; also an easel for



<P>painting and a pair of globes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined

to



<P>apply: she had not been used to regular occupation of any kind. I felt



<P>it would be injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I



<P>had talked to her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and



<P>when the morning had advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to



<P>her nurse. I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in



<P>drawing some little sketches for her use.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils,

Mrs.



<P>Fairfax called to me: 'Your morning school-hours are over now, I



<P>suppose,' said she. She was in a room the folding doors of which stood



<P>open: I went in when she addressed me. It was a large, stately



<P>apartment, with purple chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet,



<P>walnut-panelled walls, one vast window rich in stained glass, and a



<P>lofty ceiling, nobly moulded. Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of



<P>fine purple spar, which stood on a sideboard.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What a beautiful room!' I exclaimed, as I looked round;

for I



<P>had never before seen any half so imposing.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; this is the dining-room. I have just opened the window,

to



<P>let in a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in



<P>apartments that are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels



<P>like a vault.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window,

and hung



<P>like it with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up. Mounting to it by



<P>two broad steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse



<P>of a fairy place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view



<P>beyond. Yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it



<P>a boudoir, both spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid



<P>brilliant garlands of flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of



<P>white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast



<P>crimson couches and ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian



<P>mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between



<P>the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and



<P>fire.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!' said

I. 'No



<P>dust, no canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would



<P>think they were inhabited daily.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are

rare,



<P>they are always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put



<P>him out to find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of



<P>arrangement on his arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in



<P>readiness.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and

habits,



<P>and he expects to have things managed in conformity to them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you like him? Is he generally liked?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here. Almost

all



<P>the land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged

to



<P>the Rochesters time out of mind.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you

like



<P>him? Is he liked for himself?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe

he is



<P>considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has



<P>never lived much amongst them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But has he no peculiarities? What, in short, is his character?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose. He is rather



<P>peculiar, perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great



<P>deal of the world, I should think. I daresay he is clever, but I never



<P>had much conversation with him.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In what way is he peculiar?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't know- it is not easy to describe- nothing striking,

but



<P>you feel it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether



<P>he is in jest or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you



<P>don't thoroughly understand him, in short- at least, I don't: but it



<P>is of no consequence, he is a very good master.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her

employer



<P>and mine. There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a



<P>character, or observing and describing salient points, either in



<P>persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class;



<P>my queries puzzled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr.



<P>Rochester in her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor- nothing more:



<P>she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my



<P>wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When we left the dining-room she proposed to show me over

the



<P>rest of the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs,



<P>admiring as I went; for all was well arranged and handsome. The



<P>large front chambers I thought especially grand: and some of the



<P>third-storey rooms, though dark and low, were interesting from their



<P>air of antiquity. The furniture once appropriated to the lower



<P>apartments had from time to time been removed here, as fashions



<P>changed: and the imperfect light entering by their narrow casement



<P>showed bed-steads of a hundred years old; chests in oak or walnut,



<P>looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and cherubs'



<P>heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,



<P>high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose



<P>cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced



<P>embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been



<P>coffin-dust. All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield



<P>Hall the aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory. I liked the



<P>hush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I

by



<P>no means coveted a night's repose on one of those wide and heavy beds:



<P>shut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with wrought



<P>old English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies of



<P>strange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,-



<P>all which would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of



<P>moonlight.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do the servants sleep in these rooms?' I asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back;

no



<P>one ever sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost



<P>at Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So I think: you have no ghost, then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'None that I ever heard of,' returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe not. And yet it is said the Rochesters have

been



<P>rather a violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though,



<P>that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes- "after life's fitful fever they sleep well,"' I muttered.



<P>'Where are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?' for she was moving away.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?'

I



<P>followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence



<P>by a ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall. I was now



<P>on a level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.



<P>Leaning over the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the



<P>grounds laid out like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely



<P>girdling the grey base of the mansion; the field, wide as a park,



<P>dotted with its ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a



<P>path visibly overgrown, greener with moss than the trees were with



<P>foliage; the church at the gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all



<P>reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon bounded by a



<P>propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white. No feature in the



<P>scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing. When I turned from it



<P>and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way down the



<P>ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of



<P>blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of



<P>grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre,



<P>and over which I had been gazing with delight.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door;

I,



<P>by dint of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded



<P>to descend the narrow garret staircase. I lingered in the long passage



<P>to which this led, separating the front and back rooms of the third



<P>storey: narrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far



<P>end, and looking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut,



<P>like a corridor in some Bluebeard's castle.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear

in so



<P>still a region, a laugh, struck my ear. It was a curious laugh;



<P>distinct, formal, mirthless. I stopped: the sound ceased, only for



<P>an instant; it began again, louder: for at first, though distinct,



<P>it was very low. It passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake



<P>an echo in every lonely chamber; though it originated but in one,



<P>and I could have pointed out the door whence the accents issued.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mrs. Fairfax!' I called out: for I now heard her descending

the



<P>great stairs. 'Did you hear that loud laugh? Who is it?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Some of the servants, very likely,' she answered: 'perhaps

Grace



<P>Poole.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you hear it?' I again inquired.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these

rooms.



<P>Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated

in



<P>an odd murmur.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Grace!' exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh

was as



<P>tragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that

it



<P>was high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the



<P>curious cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear,



<P>I should have been superstitiously afraid. However, the event showed



<P>me I was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,- a

woman of



<P>between thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and



<P>with a hard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less



<P>ghostly could scarcely be conceived.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Too much noise, Grace,' said Mrs. Fairfax. 'Remember



<P>directions!' Grace curtseyed silently and went in.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her



<P>housemaid's work,' continued the widow; 'not altogether



<P>unobjectionable in some points, but she does well enough. By the



<P>bye, how have you got on with your new pupil this morning?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till

we reached



<P>the light and cheerful region below. Adele came running to meet us



<P>in the hall, exclaiming-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mesdames, vous etes servies!' adding, 'J'ai bien faim,

moi!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's

room.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; FIVE o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th

of



<P>January, when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me



<P>already up and nearly dressed. I had risen half an hour before her



<P>entrance, and had washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light



<P>of a half-moon just setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow



<P>window near my crib. I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach



<P>which passed the lodge gates at six A.M. Bessie was the only person



<P>yet risen; she had lit a fire in the nursery, where she now



<P>proceeded to make my breakfast. Few children can eat when excited with



<P>the thoughts of a journey; nor could I. Bessie, having pressed me in



<P>vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had



<P>prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into



<P>my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping



<P>herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery. As we passed Mrs.



<P>Reed's bedroom, she said, 'Will you go in and bid Missis good-bye?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were

gone down



<P>to supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my



<P>cousins either; and she told me to remember that she had always been



<P>my best friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her



<P>accordingly.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What did you say, Miss?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned

from



<P>her to the wall.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That was wrong, Miss Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was quite right, Bessie. Your Missis has not been my

friend:



<P>she has been my foe.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'O Miss Jane! don't say so!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-bye to Gateshead!' cried I, as we passed through

the hall and



<P>went out at the front door.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried

a lantern,



<P>whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent



<P>thaw. Raw and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I



<P>hastened down the drive. There was a light in the porter's lodge: when



<P>we reached it, we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my



<P>trunk, which had been carried down the evening before, stood corded

at



<P>the door. It wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that



<P>hour had struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming



<P>coach; I went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly



<P>through the gloom.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is she going by herself?' asked the porter's wife.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And how far is it?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fifty miles.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What a long way! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust

her



<P>so far alone.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four

horses



<P>and its top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged



<P>haste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to



<P>which I clung with kisses.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Be sure and take good care of her,' cried she to the guard,

as



<P>he lifted me into the inside.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ay, ay!' was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice



<P>exclaimed 'All right,' and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie



<P>and Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed,



<P>remote and mysterious regions.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember but little of the journey; I only know that

the day



<P>seemed to me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel



<P>over hundreds of miles of road. We passed through several towns, and



<P>in one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken



<P>out, and the passengers alighted to dine. I was carried into an inn,



<P>where the guard wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no



<P>appetite, he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each



<P>end, a chandelier pendent from the ceiling, and a little red gallery



<P>high up against the wall filled with musical instruments. Here I



<P>walked about for a long time, feeling very strange, and mortally



<P>apprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping me; for I believed



<P>in kidnappers, their exploits having frequently figured in Bessie's



<P>fireside chronicles. At last the guard returned; once more I was



<P>stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his own seat, sounded



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned

into



<P>dusk, I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from



<P>Gateshead: we ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great



<P>grey hills heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we



<P>descended a valley, dark with wood, and long after night had



<P>overclouded the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not

long



<P>slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door



<P>was open, and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her



<P>face and dress by the light of the lamps.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?' she asked.

I



<P>answered 'Yes', and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and



<P>the coach instantly drove away.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the

noise and



<P>motion of the coach: gathering my faculties, I looked about me.



<P>Rain, wind, and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly



<P>discerned a wall before me and a door open in it; through this door



<P>I passed with my new guide: she shut and locked it behind her. There



<P>was now visible a house or houses- for the building spread far- with



<P>many windows, and lights burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly



<P>path, splashing wet, and were admitted at a door; then the servant led



<P>me through a passage into a room with a fire, where she left me alone.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then

I



<P>looked round; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the



<P>hearth showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains,



<P>shining mahogany furniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or



<P>splendid as the drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough. I



<P>was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when



<P>the door opened, and an individual carrying a light entered; another



<P>followed close behind.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and

a pale and



<P>large forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her



<P>countenance was grave, her bearing erect.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The child is very young to be sent alone,' said she, putting

her



<P>candle down on the table. She considered me attentively for a minute



<P>or two, then further added-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are

you



<P>tired?' she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A little, ma'am.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before

she goes



<P>to bed, Miss Miller. Is this the first time you have left your parents



<P>to come to school, my little girl?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I explained to her that I had no parents. She inquired

how long



<P>they had been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I



<P>could read, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek



<P>gently with her forefinger, and saying, 'She hoped I should be a



<P>good child,' dismissed me along with Miss Miller.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one

who went



<P>with me appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her



<P>voice, look, and air. Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in



<P>complexion, though of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and



<P>action, like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she



<P>looked, indeed, what I afterwards found she really was, an



<P>under-teacher. Led by her, I passed from compartment to compartment,



<P>from passage to passage, of a large and irregular building; till,



<P>emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading that



<P>portion of the house we had traversed, we came upon the hum of many



<P>voices, and presently entered a wide, long room, with great deal



<P>tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of candles, and



<P>seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of every age,



<P>from nine or ten to twenty. Seen by the dim light of the dips, their



<P>number to me appeared countless, though not in reality exceeding



<P>eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint



<P>fashion, and long holland pinafores. It was the hour of study; they



<P>were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I had



<P>heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door,

then



<P>walking up to the top of the long room she cried out-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going

round,



<P>gathered the books and removed them. Miss Miller again gave the word



<P>of command-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing

a



<P>tray, with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon,



<P>and a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray. The



<P>portions were handed round; those who liked took a draught of the



<P>water, the mug being common to all. When it came to my turn, I



<P>drank, for I was thirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and



<P>fatigue rendering me incapable of eating; I now saw, however, that



<P>it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the

classes



<P>filed off, two and two, upstairs. Overpowered by this time with



<P>weariness, I scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was,



<P>except that, like the schoolroom, I saw it was very long. To-night I



<P>was to be Miss Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when



<P>laid down I glanced at the long rows of beds, each of which was



<P>quickly filled with two occupants; in ten minutes the single light was



<P>extinguished, and amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The night passed rapidly: I was too tired even to dream;

I only



<P>once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall



<P>in torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place



<P>by my side. When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing;



<P>the girls were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a



<P>rushlight or two burned in the room. I too rose reluctantly; it was



<P>bitter cold, and I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and



<P>washed when there was a basin at liberty, which did not occur soon,

as



<P>there was but one basin to six girls, on the stands down the middle

of



<P>the room. Again the bell rang; all formed in file, two and two, and

in



<P>that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit



<P>schoolroom: here prayers were read by Miss Miller; afterwards she



<P>called out-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Form classes!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which

Miss Miller



<P>repeatedly exclaimed, 'Silence!' and 'Order!' When it subsided, I



<P>saw them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs,



<P>placed at the four tables; all held books in their hands, and a



<P>great book, like a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.

A



<P>pause of some seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of



<P>numbers; Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this



<P>indefinite sound.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered

the



<P>room, each walked to a table and took her seat; Miss Miller assumed



<P>the fourth vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around



<P>which the smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior



<P>class I was called, and placed at the bottom of it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Business now began: the day's Collect was repeated, then

certain



<P>texts of Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted



<P>reading of chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour. By the time



<P>that exercise was terminated, day had fully dawned. The



<P>indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time: the classes were



<P>marshalled and marched into another room to breakfast: how glad I



<P>was to behold a prospect of getting something to eat! I was now nearly



<P>sick from inanition, having taken so little the day before.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on

two long



<P>tables smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay,



<P>sent forth an odour far from inviting. I saw a universal manifestation



<P>of discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those



<P>destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls



<P>of the first class, rose the whispered words-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Disgusting! The porridge is burnt again!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Silence!' ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller,

but one



<P>of the upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed,



<P>but of somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one



<P>table, while a more buxom lady presided at the other. I looked in vain



<P>for her I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss



<P>Miller occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,



<P>foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards



<P>found, took the corresponding seat at the other board. A long grace



<P>was said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the



<P>teachers, and the meal began.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or

two of my



<P>portion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger



<P>blunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge



<P>is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over



<P>it. The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and



<P>try to swallow it; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.



<P>Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks being returned



<P>for what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory



<P>was evacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and



<P>in passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the



<P>porridge and taste it; she looked at the others; all their



<P>countenances expressed displeasure, and one of them, the stout one,



<P>whispered-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Abominable stuff! How shameful!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began,

during



<P>which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of



<P>time it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and



<P>they used their privilege. The whole conversation ran on the



<P>breakfast, which one and all abused roundly. Poor things! it was the



<P>sole consolation they had. Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the



<P>room: a group of great girls standing about her spoke with serious and



<P>sullen gestures. I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by



<P>some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her head disapprovingly; but she



<P>made no great effort to check the general wrath; doubtless she



<P>shared in it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left

her circle,



<P>and standing in the middle of the room, cried-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Silence! To your seats!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng

was



<P>resolved into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour



<P>of tongues. The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but



<P>still, all seemed to wait. Ranged on benches down the sides of the



<P>room, the eighty girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage



<P>they appeared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a



<P>curl visible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow



<P>tucker about the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped



<P>something like a Highlander's purse) tied in front of their frocks,



<P>and destined to serve the purpose of a work-bag: all, too, wearing



<P>woollen stockings and country-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles.



<P>Above twenty of those clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or



<P>rather young women; it suited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even



<P>to the prettiest.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining

the



<P>teachers- none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a



<P>little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh



<P>and grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple,



<P>weather-beaten, and over-worked- when, as my eye wandered from face

to



<P>face, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common



<P>spring.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What was the matter? I had heard no order given: I was

puzzled. Ere



<P>I had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes



<P>were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and



<P>encountered the personage who had received me last night. She stood

at



<P>the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at



<P>each end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.



<P>Miss Miller, approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having



<P>received her answer, went back to her place, and said aloud-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted

moved



<P>slowly up the room. I suppose I have a considerable organ of



<P>veneration, for I retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my



<P>eyes traced her steps. Seen now, in broad day-light, she looked



<P>tall, fair, and shapely; brown eyes with a benignant light in their



<P>irids, and a fine pencilling of long lashes round, relieved the



<P>whiteness of her large front; on each of her temples her hair, of a



<P>very dark brown, was clustered in round curls, according to the



<P>fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets



<P>were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was of purple



<P>cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet; a



<P>gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her



<P>girdle. Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features;



<P>a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he



<P>will have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea



<P>of the exterior of Miss Temple- Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw



<P>the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having



<P>taken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables,



<P>summoned the first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on



<P>geography; the lower classes were called by the teachers:



<P>repetitions in history, grammar, etc., went on for an hour; writing



<P>and arithmetic succeeded, and music lessons were given by Miss



<P>Temple to some of the elder girls. The duration of each lesson was



<P>measured by the clock, which at last struck twelve. The superintendent



<P>rose-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have a word to address to the pupils,' said she.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking

forth,



<P>but it sank at her voice. She went on-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat;

you must



<P>be hungry:- I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be



<P>served to all.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is to be done on my responsibility,' she added, in

an



<P>explanatory tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed,

to



<P>the high delight and refreshment of the whole school. The order was



<P>now given 'To the garden!' Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with



<P>strings of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze, I was



<P>similarly equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into



<P>the open air.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The garden was a wide enclosure, surrounded with walls

so high as



<P>to exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down



<P>one side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into



<P>scores of little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the



<P>pupils to cultivate, and each bed had an owner. When full of flowers



<P>they would doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of



<P>January, all was wintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I stood



<P>and looked round me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not



<P>positively rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under



<P>foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The



<P>stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games, but



<P>sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in



<P>the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist penetrated to their



<P>shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to

take



<P>notice of me; I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of



<P>isolation I was accustomed; it did not oppress me much. I leant



<P>against a pillar of the verandah, drew my grey mantle close about



<P>me, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped me without, and the



<P>unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within, delivered myself up to



<P>the employment of watching and thinking. My reflections were too



<P>undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly yet knew where I



<P>was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable



<P>distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the future I could



<P>form no conjecture. I looked round the convent-like garden, and then



<P>up at the house- a large building, half of which seemed grey and



<P>old, the other half quite new. The new part, containing the schoolroom



<P>and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows, which gave



<P>it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore this



<P>inscription-



<P>Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.' 'Let your light



<P>so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify



<P>your Father which is in heaven.'- St. Matt. v. 16.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I read these words over and over again: I felt that an



<P>explanation belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate



<P>their import. I was still pondering the signification of



<P>'Institution', and endeavouring to make out a connection between the



<P>first words and the verse of Scripture, when the sound of a cough



<P>close behind me made me turn my head. I saw a girl sitting on a



<P>stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the perusal of which



<P>she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the title- it was



<P>Rasselas; a name that struck me as strange, and consequently



<P>attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and I said to



<P>her directly-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is your book interesting?' I had already formed the intention

of



<P>asking her to lend it to me some day.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I like it,' she answered, after a pause of a second or

two, during



<P>which she examined me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is it about?' I continued. I hardly know where I

found the



<P>hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was



<P>contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched

a



<P>chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a



<P>frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the



<P>serious or substantial.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You may look at it,' replied the girl, offering me the

book.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents

were



<P>less taking than the title: Rasselas looked dull to my trifling taste;



<P>I saw nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety



<P>seemed spread over the closely-printed pages. I returned it to her;



<P>she received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about



<P>to relapse into her former studious mood: again I ventured to



<P>disturb her-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the

door



<P>means? What is Lowood Institution?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This house where you are come to live.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way

different



<P>from other schools?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the

rest of



<P>us, are charity-children. I suppose you are an orphan: are not



<P>either your father or your mother dead?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Both died before I can remember.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both

parents, and



<P>this is called an institution for educating orphans.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do we pay no money? Do they keep us for nothing?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for

each.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then why do they call us charity-children?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching,

and



<P>the deficiency is supplied by subscription.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who subscribes?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this



<P>neighbourhood and in London.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The lady who built the new part of this house as that

tablet



<P>records, and whose son overlooks and directs everything here.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who

wears a



<P>watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To Miss Temple? Oh, no! I wish it did: she has to answer

to Mr.



<P>Brocklehurst for all she does. Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food



<P>and all our clothes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Does he live here?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No- two miles off, at a large hall.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is he a good man?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what are the other teachers called?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends

to the



<P>work, and cuts out- for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and



<P>pelisses, and everything; the little one with black hair is Miss



<P>Scatcherd; she teaches history and grammar, and hears the second class



<P>repetitions; and the one who wears a shawl, and has a



<P>pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband, is



<P>Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and teaches French.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you like the teachers?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well enough.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you like the little black one, and the Madame-? -I

cannot



<P>pronounce her name as you do.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Scatcherd is hasty- you must take care not to offend

her;



<P>Madame Pierrot is not a bad sort of person.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But Miss Temple is the best- isn't she?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above

the rest,



<P>because she knows far more than they do.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you been long here?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Two years.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you an orphan?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My mother is dead.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you happy here?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You ask rather too many questions. I have given you answers

enough



<P>for the present: now I want to read.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all

re-entered



<P>the house. The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely



<P>more appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast:



<P>the dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a



<P>strong steam redolent of rancid fat. I found the mess to consist of



<P>indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and



<P>cooked together. Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was



<P>apportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within



<P>myself whether every day's fare would be like this.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom:

lessons



<P>recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw

the girl



<P>with whom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by



<P>Miss Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle



<P>of the large schoolroom. The punishment seemed to me in a high



<P>degree ignominious, especially for so great a girl- she looked



<P>thirteen or upwards. I expected she would show signs of great distress



<P>and shame; but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed:



<P>composed, though grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes.



<P>'How can she bear it so quietly- so firmly?' I asked of myself.



<P>'Were I in her place, it seems to me I should wish the earth to open



<P>and swallow me up. She looks as if she were thinking of something



<P>beyond her punishment- beyond her situation: of something not round



<P>her nor before her. I have heard of day-dreams- is she in a



<P>day-dream now? Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure they



<P>do not see it- her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:



<P>she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is



<P>really present. I wonder what sort of a girl she is- whether good or



<P>naughty.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after five P.M. we had another meal, consisting of

a small mug



<P>of coffee, and half a slice of brown bread. I devoured my bread and



<P>drank my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much



<P>more- I was still hungry. Half an hour's recreation succeeded, then



<P>study; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and



<P>bed. Such was my first day at Lowood.

CHAPTER XXIX</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE recollection of about three days and nights succeeding

this



<P>is very dim in my mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that



<P>interval; but few thoughts framed, and no actions performed. I knew



<P>I was in a small room and in a narrow bed. To that bed I seemed to



<P>have grown; I lay on it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me



<P>from it would have been almost to kill me. I took no note of the lapse



<P>of time- of the change from morning to noon, from noon to evening. I



<P>observed when any one entered or left the apartment: I could even tell



<P>who they were; I could understand what was said when the speaker stood



<P>near to me; but I could not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs



<P>was equally impossible. Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent



<P>visitor. Her coming disturbed me. I had a feeling that she wished me



<P>away: that she did not understand me or my circumstances; that she was



<P>prejudiced against me. Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once



<P>or twice a day. They would whisper sentences of this sort at my



<P>bedside-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is very well we took her in.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door

in the



<P>morning had she been left out all night. I wonder what she has gone



<P>through?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Strange hardships, I imagine- poor, emaciated, pallid

wanderer?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her

manner



<P>of speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took



<P>off, though splashed and wet, were little worn and fine.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is,

I



<P>rather like it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy



<P>her physiognomy would be agreeable.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of

regret at



<P>the hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or



<P>aversion to, myself. I was comforted.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my

state of



<P>lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted



<P>fatigue. He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he



<P>was sure, would manage best, left to herself. He said every nerve



<P>had been overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep



<P>torpid a while. There was no disease. He imagined my recovery would

be



<P>rapid enough when once commenced. These opinions he delivered in a few



<P>words, in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone

of



<P>a man little accustomed to expansive comment, 'Rather an unusual



<P>physiognomy; certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Far otherwise,' responded Diana. 'To speak truth, St.

John, my



<P>heart rather warms to the poor little soul. I wish we may be able to



<P>benefit her permanently.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is hardly likely,' was the reply. 'You will find

she is



<P>some young lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and



<P>has probably injudiciously left them. We may, perhaps, succeed in



<P>restoring her to them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of



<P>force in her face which make me sceptical of her tractability.' He



<P>stood considering me some minutes; then added, 'She looks sensible,



<P>but not at all handsome.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is so ill, St. John.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ill or well, she would always be plain. The grace and

harmony of



<P>beauty are quite wanting in those features.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak,



<P>move, rise in bed, and turn. Hannah had brought me some gruel and



<P>dry toast, about, as I supposed, the dinner-hour. I had eaten with



<P>relish: the food was good- void of the feverish flavour which had



<P>hitherto poisoned what I had swallowed. When she left me, I felt



<P>comparatively strong and revived: ere long satiety of repose and



<P>desire for action stirred me. I wished to rise; but what could I put



<P>on? Only my damp and bemired apparel; in which I had slept on the



<P>ground and fallen in the marsh. I felt ashamed to appear before my



<P>benefactors so clad. I was spared the humiliation.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean

and dry. My



<P>black silk frock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were



<P>removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was



<P>quite decent. My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered



<P>presentable. There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb



<P>and brush to smooth my hair. After a weary process, and resting



<P>every five minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. My clothes hung



<P>loose on me; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with



<P>a shawl, and once more, clean and respectable looking- no speck of the



<P>dirt, no trace of the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to



<P>degrade me, left- I crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the



<P>banisters, to a narrow low passage, and found my way presently to



<P>the kitchen.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth

of a



<P>generous fire. Hannah was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are



<P>most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been



<P>loosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds



<P>among stones. Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first:



<P>latterly she had begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come

in



<P>tidy and well-dressed, she even smiled.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What, you have got up!' she said. 'You are better, then.

You may



<P>sit you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled

about,



<P>examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye. Turning

to



<P>me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger

was out of



<P>the question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I



<P>answered quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar. I am no beggar;

any



<P>more than yourself or your young ladies.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After a pause she said, 'I dunnut understand that: you've

like no



<P>house, nor no brass, I guess?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean

money)



<P>does not make a beggar in your sense of the word.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are you book-learned?' she inquired presently.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, very.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you've never been to a boarding-school?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was at a boarding-school eight years.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She opened her eyes wide. 'Whatever cannot ye keep yourself

for,



<P>then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.

What



<P>are you going to do with these gooseberries?' I inquired as she



<P>brought out a basket of the fruit.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mak' 'em into pies.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Give them to me and I'll pick them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I must do something. Let me have them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to

spread over



<P>my dress, 'lest,' as she said, 'I should mucky it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands,'

she



<P>remarked. 'Happen ye've been a dressmaker?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, you are wrong. And now, never mind what I have been:

don't



<P>trouble your head further about me; but tell me the name of the



<P>house where we are.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.

When he



<P>is at home, he is in his own parish at Morton.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That village a few miles off?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Aye.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what is he?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is a parson.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage,



<P>when I had asked to see the clergyman. 'This, then, was his father's



<P>residence?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather,



<P>and gurt (great) grandfather afore him.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Their father is dead?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They have no mother?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The mistress has been dead this mony a year.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you lived with the family long?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I've lived here thirty year. I nursed them all three'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That proves you must have been an honest and faithful

servant. I



<P>will say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call



<P>me a beggar.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She again regarded me with a surprised stare. 'I believe,'

she



<P>said, 'I was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so



<P>mony cheats goes about, you mun forgie me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And though,' I continued, rather severely, 'you wished

to turn



<P>me from the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, it was hard: but what can a body do? I thought more

o' th'



<P>childer nor of mysel: poor things! They've like nobody to tak' care

on



<P>'em but me. I'm like to look sharpish.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You munnut think too hardly of me,' she again remarked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I do think hardly of you,' I said; 'and I'll tell

you why- not



<P>so much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an



<P>impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that

I



<P>had no "brass" and no house. Some of the best people that ever lived



<P>have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you



<P>ought not to consider poverty a crime.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No more I ought,' said she: 'Mr. St. John tells me so

too; and I



<P>see I wor wrang- but I've clear a different notion on you now to



<P>what I had. You look a raight down dacent little crater.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That will do- I forgive you now. Shake hands.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and

heartier



<P>smile illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hannah was evidently fond of talking. While I picked the

fruit, and



<P>she made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry



<P>details about her deceased master and mistress, and 'the childer,'



<P>as she called the young people.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a



<P>gentleman, and of as ancient a family as could be found. Marsh End had



<P>belonged to the Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she



<P>affirmed, 'aboon two hundred year old- for all it looked but a



<P>small, humble place, naught to compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall



<P>down i' Morton Vale. But she could remember Bill Oliver's father a



<P>journeyman needle-maker; and th' Rivers wor gentry i' th' owd days



<P>o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking into th' registers i'



<P>Morton Church vestry.' Still, she allowed, 'the owd maister was like



<P>other folk- naught mich out o' th' common way: stark mad o'



<P>shooting, and farming, and sich like.' The mistress was different. She



<P>was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the 'bairns' had taken



<P>after her. There was nothing like them in these parts, nor ever had



<P>been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time they



<P>could speak; and they had always been 'of a mak' of their own.' Mr.



<P>St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and



<P>the girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as



<P>governesses: for they had told her their father had some years ago



<P>lost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt;



<P>and as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they must



<P>provide for themselves. They had lived very little at home for a



<P>long while, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of



<P>their father's death; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton, and



<P>all these moors and hills about. They had been in London, and many



<P>other grand towns; but they always said there was no place like



<P>home; and then they were so agreeable with each other- never fell



<P>out nor 'threaped.' She did not know where there was such a family for



<P>being united.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked

where the



<P>two ladies and their brother were now.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back

in half



<P>an hour to tea.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them:

they



<P>entered by the kitchen door. Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely



<P>bowed and passed through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few



<P>words, kindly and calmly expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing



<P>me well enough to be able to come down; Diana took my hand: she



<P>shook her head at me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You should have waited for my leave to descend,' she said.

'You



<P>still look very pale- and so thin! Poor child!- poor girl!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of

a dove.



<P>She possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter. Her whole face



<P>seemed to me full of charm. Mary's countenance was equally



<P>intelligent- her features equally pretty; but her expression was



<P>more reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant. Diana



<P>looked and spoke with a certain authority: she had a will,



<P>evidently. It was my nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an



<P>authority supported like hers, and to bend, where my conscience and



<P>self-respect permitted, to an active will.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what business have you here?' she continued. 'It is

not your



<P>place. Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we



<P>like to be free, even to license- but you are a visitor, and must go



<P>into the parlour.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am very well here.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you

with



<P>flour.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Besides, the fire is too hot for you,' interposed Mary.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To be sure,' added her sister. 'Come, you must be obedient.'

And



<P>still holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner



<P>room.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sit there,' she said, placing me on the sofa, 'while we

take our



<P>things off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we



<P>exercise in our little moorland home- to prepare our own meals when

we



<P>are so inclined, or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or



<P>ironing.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John,

who sat



<P>opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand. I examined first, the



<P>parlour, and then its occupant.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished,

yet



<P>comfortable, because clean and neat. The old-fashioned chairs were



<P>very bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass. A few



<P>strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days



<P>decorated the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained



<P>some books and an ancient set of china. There was no superfluous



<P>ornament in the room- not one modern piece of furniture, save a



<P>brace of workboxes and a lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a



<P>side-table: everything- including the carpet and curtains- looked at



<P>once well worn and well saved.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. St. John- sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures

on



<P>the walls, keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips



<P>mutely sealed- was easy enough to examine. Had he been a statue



<P>instead of a man, he could not have been easier. He was young- perhaps



<P>from twenty-eight to thirty- tall, slender; his face riveted the



<P>eye; it was like a Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight,



<P>classic nose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin. It is seldom,



<P>indeed, an English face comes so near the antique models as did his.



<P>He might well be a little shocked at the irregularity of my



<P>lineaments, his own being so harmonious. His eyes were large and blue,



<P>with brown lashes; his high forehead, colourless as ivory, was



<P>partially streaked over by careless locks of fair hair.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader? Yet he

whom it



<P>describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a



<P>yielding, an impressible, or even of a placid nature. Quiescent as



<P>he now sat, there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his



<P>brow, which, to my perceptions, indicated elements within either



<P>restless, or hard, or eager. He did not speak to me one word, nor even



<P>direct to me one glance, till his sisters returned. Diana, as she



<P>passed in and out, in the course of preparing tea, brought me a little



<P>cake, baked on the top of the oven.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Eat that now,' she said: 'you must be hungry. Hannah says

you have



<P>had nothing but some gruel since breakfast.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.

Mr.



<P>Rivers now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a



<P>seat, fixed his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me. There was an



<P>unceremonious directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his



<P>gaze now, which told that intention and not diffidence, had hitherto



<P>kept it averted from the stranger.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are very hungry,' he said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am, sir.' It is my way- it always was my way, by instinct-



<P>ever to meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to

abstain



<P>for the last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to



<P>the cravings of your appetite at first. Now you may eat, though



<P>still not immoderately.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir,' was

my very



<P>clumsily-contrived, unpolished answer.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No,' he said coolly: 'when you have indicated to us the



<P>residence of your friends, we can write to them, and you may be



<P>restored to home.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do;

being



<P>absolutely without home and friends.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there

was



<P>no suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity. I speak



<P>particularly of the young ladies. St. John's eyes, though clear enough



<P>in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom. He



<P>seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's



<P>thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of



<P>keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass



<P>than to encourage.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you mean to say,' he asked, 'that you are completely

isolated



<P>from every connection?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do. Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim

do I



<P>possess to admittance under any roof in England.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A most singular position at your age!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were

folded on



<P>the table before me. I wondered what he sought there: his words soon



<P>explained the quest.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have never been married? You are a spinster?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Diana laughed. 'Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen

years



<P>old, St. John,' said she.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am near nineteen: but I am not married. No.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and

agitating



<P>recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage. They all



<P>saw the embarrassment and the emotion. Diana and Mary relieved me by



<P>turning their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the



<P>colder and sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he



<P>had excited forced out tears as well as colour.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where did you last reside?' he now asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are too inquisitive, St. John,' murmured Mary in a

low



<P>voice; but he leaned over the table and required an answer by a second



<P>firm and piercing look.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The name of the place where, and of the person with whom

I



<P>lived, is my secret,' I replied concisely.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to

keep, both



<P>from St. John and every other questioner,' remarked Diana.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot

help



<P>you,' he said. 'And you need help, do you not?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true



<P>philanthropist will put me in the way of getting work which I can



<P>do, and the remuneration for which will keep me, if but in the



<P>barest necessaries of life.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am

willing to



<P>aid you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest. First, then,



<P>tell me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you can do.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had now swallowed my tea. I was mightily refreshed by

the



<P>beverage; as much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my



<P>unstrung nerves, and enabled me to address this penetrating young



<P>judge steadily.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rivers,' I said, turning to him, and looking at him,

as he



<P>looked at me, openly and without diffidence, 'you and your sisters



<P>have done me a great service- the greatest man can do his



<P>fellow-being; you have rescued me, by your noble hospitality, from



<P>death. This benefit conferred gives you an unlimited claim on my



<P>gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent, on my confidence. I



<P>will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer you have



<P>harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of mind-

my



<P>own security, moral and physical, and that of others.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman. My parents

died



<P>before I could know them. I was brought up a dependant; educated in



<P>a charitable institution. I will even tell you the name of the



<P>establishment, where I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a



<P>Mr. Rivers?- the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst is the treasurer.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the

school.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private

governess. I



<P>obtained a good situation, and was happy. This place I was obliged



<P>to leave four days before I came here. The reason of my departure I



<P>cannot and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and



<P>would sound incredible. No blame attached to me: I am as free from



<P>culpability as any one of you three. Miserable I am, and must be for

a



<P>time; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a



<P>paradise was of a strange and direful nature. I observed but two



<P>points in planning my departure- speed, secrecy: to secure these, I



<P>had to leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel;



<P>which, in my hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the



<P>coach that brought me to Whitcross. To this neighbourhood, then, I



<P>came, quite destitute. I slept two nights in the open air, and



<P>wandered about two days without crossing a threshold: but twice in



<P>that space of time did I taste food; and it was when brought by



<P>hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mr.



<P>Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your door, and took me under



<P>the shelter of your roof. I know all your sisters have done for me



<P>since- for I have not been insensible during my seeming torpor- and



<P>I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt



<P>as to your evangelical charity.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't make her talk any more now, St. John,' said Diana,

as I



<P>paused; 'she is evidently not yet fit for excitement. Come to the sofa



<P>and sit down now, Miss Elliott.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the alias:

I had



<P>forgotten my new name. Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape,



<P>noticed it at once.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You said your name was Jane Elliott?' he observed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient



<P>to be called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear



<P>it, it sounds strange to me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your real name you will not give?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure



<P>would lead to it, I avoid.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are quite right, I am sure,' said Diana. 'Now do,

brother, let



<P>her be at peace a while.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced

as



<P>imperturbably and with as much acumen as ever.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality-

you



<P>would wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters'



<P>compassion, and, above all, with my charity (I am quite sensible of



<P>the distinction drawn, nor do I resent it- it is just): you desire



<P>to be independent of us?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I do: I have already said so. Show me how to work, or

how to



<P>seek work: that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to



<P>the meanest cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread



<P>another essay of the horrors of homeless destitution.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed you shall stay here,' said Diana, putting her white

hand on



<P>my head. 'You shall,' repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative



<P>sincerity which seemed natural to her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you,'

said Mr. St.



<P>John, 'as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a



<P>half-frozen bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their



<P>casement. I feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping



<P>yourself, and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is



<P>narrow. I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must



<P>be of the humblest sort. And if you are inclined to despise the day

of



<P>small things, seek some more efficient succour than such as I can



<P>offer.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She has already said that she is willing to do anything

honest she



<P>can do,' answered Diana for me; 'and you know, St. John, she has no



<P>choice of helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people



<P>as you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I

will be a



<P>servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better,' I answered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Right,' said Mr. St. John, quite coolly. 'If such is your



<P>spirit, I promise to aid you, in my own time and way.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied

before tea.



<P>I soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my



<P>present strength would permit.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THERE was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We

had been



<P>wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning;



<P>but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early)



<P>the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a



<P>rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of



<P>the question.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially

on chilly



<P>afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight,



<P>with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings



<P>of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my



<P>physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered

round



<P>their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the



<P>fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither



<P>quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had



<P>dispensed from joining the group; saying, 'She regretted to be under



<P>the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard



<P>from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was



<P>endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and



<P>childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner-



<P>something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were- she really



<P>must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,



<P>little children.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What does Bessie say I have done?' I asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides,

there is



<P>something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that



<P>manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly,



<P>remain silent.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A small breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped

in



<P>there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume,



<P>taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into



<P>the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a



<P>Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was



<P>shrined in double retirement.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand;

to



<P>the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating



<P>me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the



<P>leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.



<P>Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet



<P>lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly



<P>before a long and lamentable blast.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I returned to my book- Bewick's History of British Birds:

the



<P>letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet



<P>there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could



<P>not pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts



<P>of sea-fowl; of 'the solitary rocks and promontories' by them only



<P>inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its



<P>southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where

the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boils

round the naked, melancholy isles



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of

farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pours

in among the stormy Hebrides.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of



<P>Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with



<P>'the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of



<P>dreary space,- that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields



<P>of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine



<P>heights above heights, surround the pole and concentre the



<P>multiplied rigours of extreme cold.' Of these death-white realms I



<P>formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended



<P>notions that float dim through children's brains, but strangely



<P>impressive. The words in these introductory pages connected themselves



<P>with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock



<P>standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat



<P>stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing



<P>through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary

churchyard,



<P>with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low



<P>horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent,



<P>attesting the hour of eventide.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be

marine



<P>phantoms.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed

over



<P>quickly: it was an object of terror.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying

a



<P>distant crowd surrounding a gallows.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped



<P>understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting:



<P>as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter



<P>evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having



<P>brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit



<P>about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped



<P>her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love



<P>and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as



<P>at a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry,



<P>Earl of Moreland.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least

in my way.



<P>I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The



<P>breakfast-room door opened.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Boh! Madam Mope!' cried the voice of John Reed; then he

paused: he



<P>found the room apparently empty.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where the dickens is she!' he continued. 'Lizzy! Georgy!



<P>(calling to his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out



<P>into the rain- bad animal!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is well I drew the curtain,' thought I; and I wished



<P>fervently he might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed



<P>have found it out himself; he was not quick either of vision or



<P>conception; but Eliza just put her head in at the door, and said at



<P>once-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea

of being



<P>dragged forth by the said Jack.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do you want?' I asked, with awkward diffidence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Say, "What do you want, Master Reed?"' was the answer.

'I want you



<P>to come here;' and seating himself in an armchair, he intimated by a



<P>gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years

older



<P>than I, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy



<P>and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy



<P>limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at table,



<P>which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and



<P>flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had



<P>taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate



<P>health.' Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well

if



<P>he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother's



<P>heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more



<P>refined idea that John's sallowness was owing to over-application and,



<P>perhaps, to pining after home.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; John had not much affection for his mother and sisters,

and an



<P>antipathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not two or three times

in



<P>the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve

I



<P>had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he



<P>came near. There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he



<P>inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his



<P>menaces or his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend



<P>their young master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was



<P>blind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him



<P>abuse me, though he did both now and then in her very presence, more



<P>frequently, however, behind her back.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he

spent



<P>some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he



<P>could without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and



<P>while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance



<P>of him who would presently deal it. I wonder if he read that notion

in



<P>my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and



<P>strongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a



<P>step or two from his chair.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,'

said



<P>he, 'and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the



<P>look you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of

replying to



<P>it; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow



<P>the insult.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What were you doing behind the curtain?' he asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was reading.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Show the book.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I returned to the window and fetched it thence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have no business to take our books; you are a dependant,



<P>mama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought



<P>to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and



<P>eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense. Now,



<P>I'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they are mine; all the



<P>house belongs to me, or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the



<P>door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but

when I saw



<P>him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I



<P>instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough,



<P>however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head



<P>against the door and cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp:



<P>my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Wicked and cruel boy!' I said. 'You are like a murderer-

you are



<P>like a slave-driver- you are like the Roman emperors!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed

my opinion



<P>of Nero, Caligula, etc. Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which

I



<P>never thought thus to have declared aloud.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What! what!' he cried. 'Did she say that to me? Did you

hear



<P>her, Eliza and Georgiana? Won't I tell mama? but first-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my

shoulder: he



<P>had closed with a desperate thing. I really saw in him a tyrant, a



<P>murderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my



<P>neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations



<P>for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic



<P>sort. I don't very well know what I did with my hands, but he called



<P>me 'Rat! Rat!' and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near him: Eliza and



<P>Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came



<P>upon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted:



<P>I heard the words-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Mrs. Reed subjoined-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.'

Four



<P>hands were immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.

CHAPTER XV</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; MR. ROCHESTER did, on a future occasion, explain it. It

was one



<P>afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and



<P>while she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk



<P>up and down a long beech avenue within sight of her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer,



<P>Celine Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a



<P>'grande passion.' This passion Celine had professed to return with



<P>even superior ardour. He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was:



<P>he believed, as he said, that she preferred his 'taille d'athlete'



<P>to the elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference

of



<P>the Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an



<P>hotel; gave her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage,



<P>cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles, etc. In short, I began the process



<P>of ruining myself in the received style, like any other spoony. I



<P>had not, it seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame



<P>and destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not



<P>to deviate an inch from the beaten centre. I had- as I deserved to



<P>have- the fate of all other spoonies. Happening to call one evening



<P>when Celine did not expect me, I found her out; but it was a warm



<P>night, and I was tired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down



<P>in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by



<P>her presence. No,- I exaggerate; I never thought there was any



<P>consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort of pastille



<P>perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of



<P>sanctity. I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of



<P>conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself



<P>to open the window and step out on to the balcony. It was moonlight



<P>and gaslight besides, and very still and serene. The balcony was



<P>furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,- I



<P>will take one now, if you will excuse me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting

of a



<P>cigar; having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah



<P>incense on the freezing and sunless air, he went on-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was



<P>croquant- (overlook the barbarism)- croquant chocolate comfits, and



<P>smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along



<P>the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when



<P>in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English



<P>horses, and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I



<P>recognised the "voiture" I had given Celine. She was returning: of



<P>course my heart thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant



<P>upon. The carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my



<P>flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata) alighted:



<P>though muffled in a cloak- an unnecessary encumbrance, by the bye,



<P>on so warm a June evening- I knew her instantly by her little foot,



<P>seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she skipped from the



<P>carriage step. Bending over the balcony, I was about to murmur "Mon



<P>ange"- in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the ear of



<P>love alone- when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;



<P>cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the



<P>pavement, and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched



<P>porte cochere of the hotel.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre? Of course

not: I need



<P>not ask you; because you never felt love. You have both sentiments yet



<P>to experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which



<P>shall waken it. You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as



<P>that in which your youth has hitherto slid away. Floating on with



<P>closed eyes and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling



<P>not far off in the bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at



<P>their base. But I tell you- and you may mark my words- you will come



<P>some day to a craggy pass in the channel, where the whole of life's



<P>stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either



<P>you will be dashed to atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne



<P>on by some master-wave into a calmer current- as I am now.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the

sterness and



<P>stillness of the world under this frost. I like Thornfield, its



<P>antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its



<P>grey facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin:



<P>and yet how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it



<P>like a great plague-house? How I do still abhor-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step

and struck



<P>his boot against the hard ground. Some hated thought seemed to have



<P>him in its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall

was



<P>before us. Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a



<P>glare such as I never saw before or since. Pain, shame, ire,



<P>impatience, disgust, detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a



<P>quivering conflict in the large pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.



<P>Wild was the wrestle which should be paramount; but another feeling



<P>rose and triumphed: something hard and cynical: self-willed and



<P>resolute: it settled his passion and petrified his countenance: he



<P>went on-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging

a point



<P>with my destiny. She stood there, by that beech-trunk- a hag like



<P>one of those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres. "You like



<P>Thornfield?" she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the



<P>air a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the



<P>house-front, between the upper and lower row of windows, "Like it if



<P>you can? Like it if you dare!"



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"I will like it" said I; "I dare like it;" and' (he subjoined



<P>moodily) 'I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness,

to



<P>goodness- yes, goodness. I wish to be a better man than I have been,



<P>than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the



<P>habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will



<P>esteem but straw and rotten wood.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock. 'Away!'

he cried



<P>harshly; 'keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!' Continuing



<P>then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the



<P>point whence he had abruptly diverged-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you leave the balcony, sir,' I asked, 'when Mdlle.

Varens



<P>entered?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question,



<P>but, on the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he



<P>turned his eyes towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his



<P>brow. 'Oh, I had forgotten Celine! Well, to resume. When I saw my



<P>charmer thus come in accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a



<P>hiss, and the green snake of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from



<P>the moonlit balcony, glided within my waistcoat, and ate its way in



<P>two minutes to my heart's core. Strange!' he exclaimed, suddenly



<P>starting again from the point. 'Strange that I should choose you for



<P>the confidant of all this, young lady; passing strange that you should



<P>listen to me quietly, as if it were the most usual thing in the



<P>world for a man like me to tell stories of his opera-mistresses to a



<P>quaint, inexperienced girl like you! But the last singularity explains



<P>the first, as I intimated once before: you, with your gravity,



<P>considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient of secrets.



<P>Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in communication



<P>with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection: it is a



<P>peculiar mind: it is a unique one. Happily I do not mean to harm it:



<P>but, if I did, it would not take harm from me. The more you and I



<P>converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh



<P>me.' After this digression he proceeded-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I remained in the balcony. "They will come to her boudoir,

no



<P>doubt," thought I: "Let me prepare an ambush." So putting my hand in



<P>through the open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an



<P>opening through which I could take observations; then I closed the



<P>casement, all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to



<P>lovers' whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I



<P>resumed it the pair came in. My eye was quickly at the aperture.



<P>Celine's chambermaid entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and



<P>withdrew. The couple were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed



<P>their cloaks, and there was "the Varens," shining in satin and



<P>jewels,- my gifts of course,- and there was her companion in an



<P>officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a vicomte- a



<P>brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and



<P>had never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely. On



<P>recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was instantly



<P>broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank under an



<P>extinguisher. A woman who could betray me for such a rival was not



<P>worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than



<P>I, who had been her dupe.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely:



<P>frivolous, mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather



<P>calculated to weary than enrage a listener. A card of mine lay on



<P>the table; this being perceived, brought my name under discussion.



<P>Neither of them possessed energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but



<P>they insulted me as coarsely as they could in their little way:



<P>especially Celine, who even waxed rather brilliant on my personal



<P>defects- deformities she termed them. Now it had been her custom to



<P>launch out into fervent admiration of what she called my "beaute



<P>male": wherein she differed diametrically from you, who told me



<P>point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think me



<P>handsome. The contrast struck me at the time and-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele here came running up again.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has

called and



<P>wishes to see you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! in that case I must abridge. Opening the window, I

walked in



<P>upon them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to



<P>vacate her hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies;



<P>disregarded screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions;



<P>made an appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de



<P>Boulogne. Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left



<P>a bullet in one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a



<P>chicken in the pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew.



<P>But unluckily the Varens, six months before, had given me this filette



<P>Adele, who, she affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be,



<P>though I see no proofs of such grim paternity written in her



<P>countenance: Pilot is more like me than she. Some years after I had



<P>broken with the mother, she abandoned her child, and ran away to Italy



<P>with a musician or singer. I acknowledged no natural claim on



<P>Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now acknowledge any,



<P>for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite destitute, I



<P>e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris, and



<P>transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an



<P>English country garden. Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now



<P>you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl,



<P>you will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will



<P>be coming to me some day with notice that you have found another



<P>place- that you beg me to look out for a new governess, etc.- Eh?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults

or



<P>yours: I have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a



<P>sense, parentless- forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir-



<P>I shall cling closer to her than before. How could I possibly prefer



<P>the spoilt pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as



<P>a nuisance, to a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a



<P>friend?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, that is the light in which you view it! Well, I must

go in



<P>now; and you too: it darkens.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot-

ran a



<P>race with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock. When



<P>we went in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my



<P>knee; kept her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked:



<P>not rebuking even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she



<P>was apt to stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a



<P>superficiality of character, inherited probably from her mother,



<P>hardly congenial to an English mind. Still she had her merits; and I



<P>was disposed to appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost. I



<P>sought in her countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester,



<P>but found none: no trait, no turn of expression announced



<P>relationship. It was a pity: if she could but have been proved to



<P>resemble him, he would have thought more of her.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber

for the



<P>night, that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.

As



<P>he had said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the



<P>substance of the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion



<P>for a French dancer, and her treachery to him, were every-day



<P>matters enough, no doubt, in society; but there was something



<P>decidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized



<P>him when he was in the act of expressing the present contentment of



<P>his mood, and his newly revived pleasure in the old hall and its



<P>environs. I meditated wonderingly on this incident; but gradually



<P>quitting it, as I found it for the present inexplicable, I turned to



<P>the consideration of my master's manner to myself. The confidence he



<P>had thought fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to my discretion: I



<P>regarded and accepted it as such. His deportment had now for some



<P>weeks been more uniform towards me than at the first. I never seemed



<P>in his way; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur: when he met me



<P>unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he had always a word and



<P>sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal invitation to his



<P>presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception that made me



<P>feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that these evening



<P>conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my benefit.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him

talk with



<P>relish. It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a



<P>mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I

do



<P>not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their



<P>interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange



<P>novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight

in



<P>receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he



<P>portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he



<P>disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint:

the



<P>friendly frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me,



<P>drew me to him. I felt at times as if he were my relation rather



<P>than my master: yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not



<P>mind that; I saw it was his way. So happy, so gratified did I become



<P>with this new interest added to life, that I ceased to pine after



<P>kindred: my thin crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of



<P>existence were filled up; my bodily health improved; I gathered



<P>flesh and strength.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader:

gratitude,



<P>and many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the



<P>object I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering



<P>than the brightest fire. Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed,

I



<P>could not, for he brought them frequently before me. He was proud,



<P>sardonic, harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul



<P>I knew that his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity



<P>to many others. He was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once,



<P>when sent for to read to him, found him sitting in his library



<P>alone, with his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked



<P>up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl blackened his features. But



<P>I believed that his moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults

of



<P>morality (I say former, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their



<P>source in some cruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a



<P>man of better tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than



<P>such as circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny



<P>encouraged. I thought there were excellent materials in him; though



<P>for the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled. I



<P>cannot deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would



<P>have given much to assuage it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down

in bed, I



<P>could not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue,



<P>and told how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to



<P>be happy at Thornfield.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why not?' I asked myself. 'What alienates him from the

house? Will



<P>he leave it again soon? Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer



<P>than a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight



<P>weeks. If he does go, the change will be doleful. Suppose he should

be



<P>absent spring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine



<P>days will seem!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing;

at



<P>any rate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and



<P>lugubrious, which sounded, I thought, just above me. I wished I had



<P>kept my candle burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were



<P>depressed. I rose and sat up in bed, listening. The sound was hushed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my

inward



<P>tranquillity was broken. The clock, far down in the hall, struck



<P>two. Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers



<P>had swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery



<P>outside. I said, 'Who is there?' Nothing answered. I was chilled



<P>with fear.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when

the



<P>kitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way



<P>up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying



<P>there myself in the mornings. The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.



<P>Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again



<P>through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber. But

it



<P>was not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream had scarcely



<P>approached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a



<P>marrow-freezing incident enough.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a demoniac laugh- low, suppressed, and deep- uttered,

as



<P>it seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door. The head of my



<P>bed was near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood



<P>at my bedside- or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked



<P>round, and could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural



<P>sound was reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels. My



<P>first impulse was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry



<P>out, 'Who is there?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Something gurgled and moaned. Ere long, steps retreated

up the



<P>gallery towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been



<P>made to shut in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was



<P>still.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?'



<P>thought I. Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to



<P>Mrs. Fairfax. I hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt



<P>and opened the door with a trembling hand. There was a candle



<P>burning just outside, and on the matting in the gallery. I was



<P>surprised at this circumstance: but still more was I amazed to



<P>perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with smoke; and, while



<P>looking to the right hand and left, to find whence these blue



<P>wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of burning.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was

Mr.



<P>Rochester's, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence. I thought

no



<P>more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the



<P>laugh: in an instant, I was within the chamber. Tongues of flame



<P>darted round the bed: the curtains were on fire. In the midst of blaze



<P>and vapour, Mr. Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Wake! wake!' I cried. I shook him, but he only murmured

and



<P>turned: the smoke had stupefied him. Not a moment could be lost: the



<P>very sheets were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer;



<P>fortunately, one was wide and the other deep, and both were filled



<P>with water. I heaved them up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew



<P>back to my own room, brought my own water-jug, baptized the couch



<P>afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in extinguishing the flames which



<P>were devouring it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher

which I



<P>flung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash



<P>of the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at



<P>last. Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him



<P>fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of



<P>water.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is there a flood?' he cried.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, sir,' I answered; 'but there has been a fire: get up,

do; you



<P>are quenched now; I will fetch you a candle.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane

Eyre?'



<P>he demanded. 'What have you done with me, witch, sorceress? Who is



<P>in the room besides you? Have you plotted to drown me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name,

get up.



<P>Somebody has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and



<P>what it is.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There! I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle

yet: wait



<P>two minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be-



<P>yes, here is my dressing-gown. Now run!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in

the



<P>gallery. He took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed,



<P>all blackened and scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round



<P>swimming in water.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is it? and who did it?' he asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I briefly related to him what had transpired: the strange

laugh I



<P>had heard in the gallery; the step ascending to the third storey;



<P>the smoke,- the smell of fire which had conducted me to his room; in



<P>what state I had found matters there, and how I had deluged him with



<P>all the water I could lay hands on.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed

more



<P>concern than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had



<P>concluded.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?' I asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mrs. Fairfax? No; what the deuce would you call her for?

What



<P>can she do? Let her sleep unmolested.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all: just be still. You have a shawl on. If you

are not



<P>warm enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and



<P>sit down in the arm-chair: there,- I will put it on. Now place your



<P>feet on the stool, to keep them out of the wet. I am going to leave



<P>you a few minutes. I shall take the candle. Remain where you are



<P>till I return; be as still as a mouse. I must pay a visit to the



<P>second storey. Don't move, remember, or call any one.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He went: I watched the light withdraw. He passed up the

gallery



<P>very softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as



<P>possible, shut it after him, and the last ray vanished. I was left



<P>in total darkness. I listened for some noise, but heard nothing. A



<P>very long time elapsed. I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the



<P>cloak; and then I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to



<P>rouse the house. I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's



<P>displeasure by disobeying his orders, when the light once more gleamed



<P>dimly on the gallery wall, and I heard his unshod feet tread the



<P>matting. 'I hope it is he,' thought I, 'and not something worse.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He re-entered, pale and very gloomy. 'I have found it all

out,'



<P>said he, setting his candle down on the washstand; 'it is as I



<P>thought.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking

on the



<P>ground. At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar



<P>tone-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened

your



<P>chamber door.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But you heard an odd laugh? You have heard that laugh

before, I



<P>should think, or something like it?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace

Poole,- she



<P>laughs in that way. She is a singular person.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just so. Grace Poole- you have guessed it. She is, as

you say,



<P>singular- very. Well, I shall reflect on the subject. Meantime, I am



<P>glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the



<P>precise details of to-night's incident. You are no talking fool: say



<P>nothing about it. I will account for this state of affairs'



<P>(pointing to the bed): 'and now return to your own room. I shall do



<P>very well on the sofa in the library for the rest of the night. It



<P>is near four:- in two hours the servants will be up.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-night, then, sir,' said I, departing.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He seemed surprised- very inconsistently so, as he had

just told me



<P>to go.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What!' he exclaimed, 'are you quitting me already, and

in that



<P>way?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You said I might go, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But not without taking leave; not without a word or two

of



<P>acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry



<P>fashion. Why, you have saved my life!- snatched me from a horrible and



<P>excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual



<P>strangers! At least shake hands.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first

in one,



<P>then in both his own.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you

so



<P>immense a debt. I cannot say more. Nothing else that has being would



<P>have been tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an



<P>obligation: but you: it is different;- I feel your benefits no burden,



<P>Jane.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on

his lips,-



<P>but his voice was checked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good-night again, sir. There is no debt, benefit, burden,



<P>obligation, in the case.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I knew,' he continued, you would do me good in some way,

at some



<P>time;- I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression



<P>and smile did not'- (again he stopped)- 'did not' (he proceeded



<P>hastily) 'strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.



<P>People talk of natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there



<P>are grains of truth in the wildest fable. My cherished preserver,



<P>good-night!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am glad I happened to be awake,' I said: and then I

was going.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What! you will go?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am cold, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cold? Yes,- and standing in a pool! Go, then, Jane; go!'

But he



<P>still retained my hand, and I could not free it. I bethought myself

of



<P>an expedient.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir,' said I.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, leave me': he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep. Till morning



<P>dawned I was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of



<P>trouble rolled under surges of joy. I thought sometimes I saw beyond



<P>its wild waters a shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and



<P>then a freshening gale, wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly



<P>towards the bourne: but I could not reach it, even in fancy- a



<P>counteracting breeze blew off land, and continually drove me back.



<P>Sense would resist delirium: judgment would warn passion. Too feverish



<P>to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.

CHAPTER XIV</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; FOR several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.

In the



<P>mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the



<P>afternoon, gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and



<P>sometimes stayed to dine with him. When his sprain was well enough



<P>to admit of horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to



<P>return these visits, as he generally did not come back till late at



<P>night.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to

his



<P>presence, and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an



<P>occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery,



<P>when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just



<P>acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and



<P>sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability. His changes



<P>of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with



<P>their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite



<P>disconnected with me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for

my



<P>portfolio; in order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen



<P>went away early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs.



<P>Fairfax informed me; but the night being wet and inclement, Mr.



<P>Rochester did not accompany them. Soon after they were gone he rang



<P>the bell: a message came that I and Adele were to go downstairs. I



<P>brushed Adele's hair and made her neat, and having ascertained that



<P>I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where there was nothing to



<P>retouch- all being too close and plain, braided locks included, to



<P>admit of disarrangement- we descended, Adele wondering whether the



<P>petit coffre was at length come; for, owing to some mistake, its



<P>arrival had hitherto been delayed. She was gratified: there it



<P>stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the



<P>dining-room. She appeared to know it by instinct.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ma boite! ma boite!' exclaimed she, running towards it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, there is your "boite" at last: take it into a corner,

you



<P>genuine daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,'



<P>said the deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester,



<P>proceeding from the depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.



<P>'And mind,' he continued, 'don't bother me with any details of the



<P>anatomical process, or any notice of the condition of the entrails:



<P>let your operation be conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille,



<P>enfant; comprends-tu?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning; she had already



<P>retired to a sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord



<P>which secured the lid. Having removed this impediment, and lifted



<P>certain silvery envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh ciel! Que c'est beau!' and then remained absorbed in

ecstatic



<P>contemplation.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is Miss Eyre there?' now demanded the master, half rising

from his



<P>seat to look round to the door, near which I still stood.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.' He drew a chair

near



<P>his own. 'I am not fond of the prattle of children,' he continued;



<P>'for, old bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations



<P>connected with their lisp. It would be intolerable to me to pass a



<P>whole evening tete-a-tete with a brat. Don't draw that chair farther



<P>off, Miss Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it- if you please,



<P>that is. Confound these civilities! I continually forget them. Nor



<P>do I particularly affect simple-minded old ladies. By the bye, I



<P>must have mine in mind; it won't do to neglect her; she is a



<P>Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is said to be thicker than water.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax,

who soon



<P>arrived, knitting-basket in hand.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.

I



<P>have forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is



<P>bursting with repletion; have the goodness to serve her as auditress



<P>and interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you



<P>ever performed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned

her to



<P>her sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the



<P>ivory, the waxen contents of her 'boite'; pouring out, meantime,



<P>explanations and raptures in such broken English as she was mistress



<P>of.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now I have performed the part of a good host,' pursued

Mr.



<P>Rochester, 'put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I



<P>ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure. Miss Eyre, draw



<P>your chair still a little farther forward: you are yet too far back;

I



<P>cannot see you without disturbing my position in this comfortable



<P>chair, which I have no mind to do.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained



<P>somewhat in the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of



<P>giving orders, it seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre,

which



<P>had been lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of



<P>light; the large fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains



<P>hung rich and ample before the lofty window and loftier arch;



<P>everything was still, save the subdued chat of Adele (she dared not



<P>speak loud), and, filling up each pause, the beating of winter rain



<P>against the panes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked



<P>different to what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern- much



<P>less gloomy. There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled,



<P>whether with wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.



<P>He was, in short, in his after dinner mood; more expanded and



<P>genial, and also more self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid



<P>temper of the morning; still he looked preciously grim, cushioning his



<P>massive head against the swelling back of his chair, and receiving the



<P>light of the fire on his granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark



<P>eyes; for he had great, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too- not



<P>without a certain change in their depths sometimes, which, if it was



<P>not softness, reminded you, at least, of that feeling.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had

been looking



<P>the same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my



<P>gaze fastened on his physiognomy.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You examine me, Miss Eyre,' said he: 'do you think me

handsome?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question

by



<P>something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow



<P>slipped from my tongue before I was aware- 'No, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah! By my word! there is something singular about you,'

said he:



<P>'you have the air of a little nonnette; quaint, quiet, grave, and



<P>simple, as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally



<P>bent on the carpet (except, by the bye, when they are directed



<P>piercingly to my face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks



<P>you a question, or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply,



<P>you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least



<P>brusque. What do you mean by it?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon. I ought to have

replied



<P>that it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about



<P>appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little



<P>consequence, or something of that sort.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of little



<P>consequence, indeed! And so, under pretence of softening the



<P>previous outrage, of stroking and soothing me into placidity, you



<P>stick a sly penknife under my ear! Go on: what fault do you find



<P>with me, pray? I suppose I have all my limbs and all my features



<P>like any other man?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended

no



<P>pointed repartee: it was only a blunder.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.

Criticise



<P>me: does my forehead not please you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally

over



<P>his brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but



<P>an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have



<P>risen.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now, ma'am, am I a fool?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Far from it, sir. You would, perhaps, think me rude if

I



<P>inquired in return whether you are a philanthropist?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There again! Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended



<P>to pat my head: and that is because I said I did not like the



<P>society of children and old women (low be it spoken!). No, young lady,



<P>I am not a general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience'; and he



<P>pointed to the prominences which are said to indicate that faculty,



<P>and which, fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving,



<P>indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of his head: 'and, besides,



<P>I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart. When I was as old as



<P>you, I was a feeling fellow enough; partial to the unfledged,



<P>unfostered, and unlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since: she



<P>has even kneaded me with her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am



<P>hard and tough as an India-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a



<P>chink or two still, and with one sentient point in the middle of the



<P>lump. Yes: does that leave hope for me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hope of what, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to

flesh?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Decidedly he has had too much wine,' I thought; and I

did not know



<P>what answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether

he



<P>was capable of being re-transformed?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you

are not



<P>pretty any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you;



<P>besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of



<P>yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted



<P>flowers of the rug; so puzzle on. Young lady, I am disposed to be



<P>gregarious and communicative tonight.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood,

leaning



<P>his arm on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen



<P>plainly as well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest,



<P>disproportionate almost to his length of limb. I am sure most people



<P>would have thought him an ugly man; yet there was so much



<P>unconscious pride in his port; so much ease in his demeanour; such a



<P>look of complete indifference to his own external appearance; so



<P>haughty a reliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or



<P>adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere personal attractiveness,



<P>that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared the indifference,



<P>and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the confidence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative tonight,'

he



<P>repeated, 'and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier



<P>were not sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for



<P>none of these can talk. Adele is a degree better, but still far



<P>below the mark; Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me



<P>if you will: you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here.



<P>I have almost forgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours



<P>from my head; but to-night I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss



<P>what importunes, and recall what pleases. It would please me now to



<P>draw you out- to learn more of you- therefore speak.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent

or



<P>submissive smile either.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Speak,' he urged.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What about, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whatever you like. I leave both the choice of subject

and the



<P>manner of treating it entirely to yourself.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly I sat and said nothing: 'If he expects me to

talk for



<P>the mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has



<P>addressed himself to the wrong person,' I thought.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are dumb, Miss Eyre.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was dumb still. He bent his head a little towards me,

and with



<P>a single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Stubborn?' he said, 'and annoyed. Ah! it is consistent.

I put my



<P>request in an absurd, almost insolent form. Miss Eyre, I beg your



<P>pardon. The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an



<P>inferior: that is' (correcting himself), 'I claim only such



<P>superiority as must result from twenty years' difference in age and



<P>a century's advance in experience. This is legitimate, et j'y tiens,



<P>as Adele would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and



<P>this alone, that I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a



<P>little now, and divert my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling



<P>on one point- cankering as a rusty nail.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I

did not



<P>feel insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir- quite willing;

but I



<P>cannot introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest



<P>you? Ask me questions, and I will do my best to answer them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I

have a right



<P>to be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on



<P>the grounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your



<P>father, and that I have battled through a varied experience with



<P>many men of many nations, and roamed over half the globe, while you



<P>have lived quietly with one set of people in one house?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do as you please, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating,

because a



<P>very evasive one. Reply clearly.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely

because



<P>you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world



<P>than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have



<P>made of your time and experience.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Humph! Promptly spoken. But I won't allow that, seeing

that it



<P>would never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say



<P>a bad, use of both advantages. Leaving superiority out of the



<P>question, then, you must still agree to receive my orders now and



<P>then, without being piqued or hurt by the tone of command. Will you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester is peculiar-

he seems



<P>to forget that he pays me L30 per annum for receiving his orders.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The smile is very well,' said he, catching instantly the

passing



<P>expression; 'but speak too.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble



<P>themselves to inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were



<P>piqued and hurt by their orders.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Paid subordinates! What! you are my paid subordinate,

are you?



<P>Oh yes, I had forgotten the salary! Well then, on that mercenary



<P>ground, will you agree to let me hector a little?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you

did



<P>forget it, and that you care whether or not a dependant is comfortable



<P>in his dependency, I agree heartily.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional



<P>forms and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from



<P>insolence?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for



<P>insolence: one I rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit



<P>to, even for a salary.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Humbug! Most things free-born will submit to anything

for a



<P>salary; therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities



<P>of which you are intensely ignorant. However, I mentally shake hands



<P>with you for your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for



<P>the manner in which it was said, as for the substance of the speech;



<P>the manner was frank and sincere; one does not often see such a



<P>manner: no, on the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid,



<P>coarse-minded misapprehension of one's meaning are the usual rewards



<P>of candour. Not three in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses



<P>would have answered me as you have just done. But I don't mean to



<P>flatter you: if you are cast in a different mould to the majority,



<P>it is no merit of yours: Nature did it. And then, after all, I go



<P>too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet know, you may be no



<P>better than the rest; you may have intolerable defects to



<P>counterbalance your few good points.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And so may you,' I thought. My eye met his as the idea

crossed



<P>my mind: he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import



<P>had been spoken as well as imagined-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, yes, you are right,' said he; 'I have plenty of faults

of



<P>my own: I know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.



<P>God wot I need not be too severe about others; I have a past



<P>existence, a series of deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within



<P>my own breast, which might well call my sneers and censures from my



<P>neighbours to myself. I started, or rather (for like other defaulters,



<P>I like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances)



<P>was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have



<P>never recovered the right course since: but I might have been very



<P>different; I might have been as good as you- wiser- almost as



<P>stainless. I envy you your peace of mind, your clean conscience,



<P>your unpolluted memory. Little girl, a memory without blot or



<P>contamination must be an exquisite treasure- an inexhaustible source



<P>of pure refreshment: is it not?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water

had



<P>turned it to fetid puddle. I was your equal at eighteen- quite your



<P>equal. Nature meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one



<P>of the better kind, and you see I am not so. You would say you don't



<P>see it; at least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye



<P>(beware, by the bye, what you express with that organ; I am quick at



<P>interpreting its language). Then take my word for it,- I am not a



<P>villain: you are not to suppose that- not to attribute to me any



<P>such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe, rather to



<P>circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace



<P>sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the



<P>rich and worthless try to put on life. Do you wonder that I avow



<P>this to you? Know, that in the course of your future life you will



<P>often find yourself elected the involuntary confidant of your



<P>acquaintances' secrets: people will instinctively find out, as I



<P>have done, that it is not your forte to tell of yourself, but to



<P>listen while others talk of themselves; they will feel, too, that



<P>you listen with no malevolent scorn of their indiscretion, but with



<P>a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting and encouraging



<P>because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How do you know?- how can you guess all this, sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as

if I



<P>were writing my thoughts in a diary. You would say, I should have been



<P>superior to circumstances; so I should- so I should; but you see I was



<P>not. When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I



<P>turned desperate; then I degenerated. Now, when any vicious



<P>simpleton excites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot



<P>flatter myself that I am better than he: I am forced to confess that



<P>he and I are on a level. I wish I had stood firm- God knows I do!



<P>Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the



<P>poison of life.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Repentance is said to be its cure, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is not its cure. Reformation may be its cure; and I

could



<P>reform- I have strength yet for that- if- but where is the use of



<P>thinking of it, hampered, burdened, cursed as I am? Besides, since



<P>happiness is irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out



<P>of life: and I will get it, cost what it may.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you will degenerate still more, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh

pleasure?



<P>And I may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee



<P>gathers on the moor.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It will sting- it will taste bitter, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How do you know?- you never tried it. How very serious-

how very



<P>solemn you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo



<P>head' (taking one from the mantelpiece). 'You have no right to



<P>preach to me, you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life,



<P>and are absolutely unacquainted with its mysteries.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error

brought



<P>remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And who talks of error now? I scarcely think the notion

that



<P>flittered across my brain was an error. I believe it was an



<P>inspiration rather than a temptation: it was very genial, very



<P>soothing- I know that. Here it comes again! It is no devil, I assure



<P>you; or if it be, it has put on the robes of an angel of light. I



<P>think I must admit so fair a guest when it asks entrance to my heart.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Once more, how do you know? By what instinct do you pretend

to



<P>distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger



<P>from the eternal throne- between a guide and a seducer?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled

when you



<P>said the suggestion had returned upon you. I feel sure it will work



<P>you more misery if you listen to it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not at all- it bears the most gracious message in the

world: for



<P>the rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself



<P>uneasy. Here, come in, bonny wanderer!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any

eye but



<P>his own; then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his



<P>chest, he seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now,' he continued, again addressing me, 'I have received

the



<P>pilgrim- a disguised deity, as I verily believe. Already it has done



<P>me good: my heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I

cannot



<P>keep up the conversation, because it has got out of my depth. Only one



<P>thing, I know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be,



<P>and that you regretted your own imperfection;- one thing I can



<P>comprehend: you intimated that to have a sullied memory was a



<P>perpetual bane. It seems to me, that if you tried hard, you would in



<P>time find it possible to become what you yourself would approve; and



<P>that if from this day you began with resolution to correct your



<P>thoughts and actions, you would in a few years have laid up a new



<P>and stainless store of recollections, to which you might revert with



<P>pleasure.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this

moment, I am



<P>paving hell with energy.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable

as



<P>flint. Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than



<P>they have been.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And better?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And better- so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.

You



<P>seem to doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what

my



<P>motives are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of



<P>the Medes and Persians, that both are right.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to

legalise



<P>them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a

new statute:



<P>unheard-of combinations or circumstances demand unheard-of rules.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see

at once



<P>that it is liable to abuse.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household

gods not



<P>to abuse it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are human and fallible.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am: so are you- what then?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with

which



<P>the divine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What power?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,-



<P>"Let it be right."'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"Let it be right"- the very words: you have pronounced

them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'May it be right then,' I said, as I rose, deeming it useless

to



<P>continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides,



<P>sensible that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my



<P>penetration; at least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the



<P>uncertainty, the vague sense of insecurity, which accompanies a



<P>conviction of ignorance.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where are you going?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered,

I



<P>am certainly not afraid.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You are afraid- your self-love dreads a blunder.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In that sense I do feel apprehensive- I have no wish to

talk



<P>nonsense.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner,

I should



<P>mistake it for sense. Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre? Don't trouble



<P>yourself to answer- I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very



<P>merrily: believe me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I

am



<P>naturally vicious. The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat;



<P>controlling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your



<P>limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother- or father,



<P>or master, or what you will- to smile too gaily, speak too freely,



<P>or move too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be



<P>natural with me, as I find it impossible to be conventional with



<P>you; and then your looks and movements will have more vivacity and



<P>variety than they dare offer now. I see at intervals the glance of a



<P>curious sort of bird through the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid,



<P>restless, resolute captive is there; were it but free, it would soar



<P>cloud-high. You are still bent on going?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It has struck nine, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never mind,- wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to

bed yet.



<P>My position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the



<P>room, favours observation. While talking to you, I have also



<P>occasionally watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a



<P>curious study,- reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you



<P>some day). She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a



<P>little pink silk frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it;



<P>coquetry runs in her blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the



<P>marrow of her bones. "Il faut que je l'essaie!" cried she, "et a



<P>l'instant meme!" and she rushed out of the room. She is now with



<P>Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in a few minutes she will



<P>re-enter; and I know what I shall see,- a miniature of Celine



<P>Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the rising of-. But



<P>never mind that. However, my tenderest feelings are about to receive

a



<P>shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it will be



<P>realised.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across

the hall.



<P>She entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted. A dress of



<P>rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it



<P>could be gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn;

a



<P>wreath of rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk



<P>stockings and small white satin sandals.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Est-ce que ma robe va bien?' cried she, bounding forwards;

'et mes



<P>souliers? et mes bas? Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room;

till,



<P>having reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him



<P>on tip-toe, then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;

then rising,



<P>she added, 'C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas,



<P>monsieur?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pre-cise-ly!' was the answer; 'and, "comme cella," she

charmed



<P>my English gold out of my British breeches' pocket. I have been green,



<P>too, Miss Eyre- ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you



<P>now than once freshened me. My Spring is gone, however, but it has



<P>left me that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I



<P>would fain be rid of. Not valuing now the root whence it sprang;



<P>having found that it was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could



<P>manure, I have but half a liking to the blossom, especially when it



<P>looks so artificial as just now. I keep it and rear it rather on the



<P>Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous sins, great or small,



<P>by one good work. I'll explain all this some day. Good-night.'

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; TWO days are passed. It is a summer evening; the coachman

has set



<P>me down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for



<P>the sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in



<P>the world. The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone. At this



<P>moment I discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket

of



<P>the coach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there



<P>it must remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone

pillar



<P>set up where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more



<P>obvious at a distance and in darkness. Four arms spring from its



<P>summit: the nearest town to which these point is, according to the



<P>inscription, distant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty. From the



<P>well-known names of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted;



<P>a north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain:



<P>this I see. There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there



<P>are waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet. The



<P>population here must be thin, and I see no passengers on these



<P>roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and south-white, broad,



<P>lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the heather grows deep and



<P>wild to their very verge. Yet a chance traveller might pass by; and



<P>I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder what I am doing,



<P>lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost. I



<P>might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound



<P>incredible and excite suspicion. Not a tie holds me to human society



<P>at this moment- not a charm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures



<P>are- none that saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me.



<P>I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I will seek her



<P>breast and ask repose.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow

I saw



<P>deeply furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark



<P>growth; I turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened



<P>granite crag in a hidden angle, I sat down under it. High banks of



<P>moor were about me; the crag protected my head: the sky was over that.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had

a vague



<P>dread that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or



<P>poacher might discover me. If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked



<P>up, fearing it was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I



<P>imagined it a man. Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and



<P>calmed by the deep silence that reigned as evening declined at



<P>nightfall, I took confidence. As yet I had not thought; I had only



<P>listened, watched, dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What was I to do? Where to go? Oh, intolerable questions,

when I



<P>could do nothing and go nowhere!- when a long way must yet be measured



<P>by my weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation-



<P>when cold charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging:



<P>reluctant sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before



<P>my tale could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the

heat of



<P>the summer day. I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star



<P>twinkled just above the chasm ridge. The day fell, but with propitious



<P>softness; no breeze whispered. Nature seemed to me benign and good;



<P>I thought she loved me, outcast as I was; and I, who from man could



<P>anticipate only mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her with



<P>filial fondness. To-night, at least, I would be her guest, as I was



<P>her child: my mother would lodge me without money and without price.

I



<P>had one morsel of bread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a



<P>town we passed through at noon with a stray penny- my last coin. I saw



<P>ripe bilberries gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the



<P>heath: I gathered a handful and ate them with the bread. My hunger,



<P>sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased by this hermit's meal.

I



<P>said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and then chose my couch.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down

my feet



<P>were buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow



<P>space for the night-air to invade. I folded my shawl double, and



<P>spread it over me for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.



<P>Thus lodged, I was not, at least at the commencement of the night,



<P>cold.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart

broke it.



<P>It plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven



<P>chords. It trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him



<P>with bitter pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and,



<P>impotent as a bird with both wings broken, it still quivered its



<P>shattered pinions in vain attempts to seek him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.

Night



<P>was come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too



<P>serene for the companionship of fear. We know that God is



<P>everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are



<P>on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded



<P>night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read



<P>clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence. I had



<P>risen to my knees to pray for Mr. Rochester. Looking up, I, with



<P>tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-way. Remembering what it was-



<P>what countless systems there swept space like a soft trace of light-

I



<P>felt the might and strength of God. Sure was I of His efficiency to



<P>save what He had made: convinced I grew that neither earth should



<P>perish, nor one of the souls it treasured. I turned my prayer to



<P>thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of spirits.



<P>Mr. Rochester was safe: he was God's, and by God would he be



<P>guarded. I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in



<P>sleep forgot sorrow.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But next day, Want came to me pale and bare. Long after

the



<P>little birds had left their nests; long after bees had come in the



<P>sweet prime of day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried-



<P>when the long morning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth



<P>and sky- I got up, and I looked round me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What a still, hot, perfect day! What a golden desert this

spreading



<P>moor! Everywhere sunshine. I wished I could live in it and on it. I



<P>saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet



<P>bilberries. I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that



<P>I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here. But I



<P>was a human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger



<P>where there was nothing to supply them. I rose; I looked back at the



<P>bed I had left. Hopeless of the future, I wished but this- that my



<P>Maker had that night thought good to require my soul of me while I



<P>slept; and that this weary frame, absolved by death from further



<P>conflict with fate, had now but to decay quietly, and mingle in



<P>peace with the soil of this wilderness. Life, however, was yet in my



<P>possession, with all its requirements, and pains, and



<P>responsibilities. The burden must be carried; the want provided for;



<P>the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled. I set out.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the

sun, now



<P>fervent and high. By no other circumstance had I will to decide my



<P>choice. I walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done



<P>enough, and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost



<P>overpowered me- might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on

a



<P>stone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart



<P>and limb- I heard a bell chime- a church bell.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst

the



<P>romantic hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an



<P>hour ago, I saw a hamlet and a spire. All the valley at my right



<P>hand was full of pasture-fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a



<P>glittering stream ran zigzag through the varied shades of green, the



<P>mellowing grain, the sombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea.



<P>Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to the road before me, I saw a



<P>heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill, and not far beyond were



<P>two cows and their drover. Human life and human labour were near. I



<P>must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil like the rest.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; About two o'clock P.M. I entered the village. At the bottom

of



<P>its one street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the



<P>window. I coveted a cake of bread. With that refreshment I could



<P>perhaps regain a degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult



<P>to proceed. The wish to have some strength and some vigour returned

to



<P>me as soon as I was amongst my fellow-beings. I felt it would be



<P>degrading to faint with hunger on the causeway of a hamlet. Had I



<P>nothing about me I could offer in exchange for one of these rolls? I



<P>considered. I had a small silk handkerchief tied round my throat; I



<P>had my gloves. I could hardly tell how men and women in extremities

of



<P>destitution proceeded. I did not know whether either of these articles



<P>would be accepted: probably they would not; but I must try.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I entered the shop: a woman was there. Seeing a respectably-dressed



<P>person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility. How



<P>could she serve me? I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter



<P>the request I had prepared. I dared not offer her the half-worn



<P>gloves, the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be



<P>absurd. I only begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.



<P>Disappointed in the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to



<P>my request. She pointed to a seat; I sank into it. I felt sorely urged



<P>to weep; but conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be,



<P>I restrained it. Soon I asked her 'if there were any dressmaker or



<P>plain-workwoman in the village?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; two or three. Quite as many as there was employment

for.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I reflected. I was driven to the point now. I was brought

face to



<P>face with Necessity. I stood in the position of one without a



<P>resource, without a friend, without a coin. I must do something. What?



<P>I must apply somewhere. Where?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a

servant was



<P>wanted?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nay; she couldn't say.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What was the chief trade in this place? What did most

of the



<P>people do?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's



<P>needle-factory, and at the foundry.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did Mr. Oliver employ women?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nay; it was men's work.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what do the women do?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I knawn't,' was the answer. 'Some does one thing, and

some



<P>another. Poor folk mun get on as they can.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what

claim had



<P>I to importune her? A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently



<P>wanted. I took leave.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses

to



<P>the right hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor



<P>see an inducement to enter any. I rambled round the hamlet, going



<P>sometimes to a little distance and returning again, for an hour or



<P>more. Much exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I



<P>turned aside into a lane and sat down under the hedge. Ere many



<P>minutes had elapsed, I was again on my feet, however, and again



<P>searching something- a resource, or at least an informant. A pretty



<P>little house stood at the top of the lane, with a garden before it,



<P>exquisitely neat and brilliantly blooming. I stopped at it. What



<P>business had I to approach the white door or touch the glittering



<P>knocker? In what way could it possibly be the interest of the



<P>inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me? Yet I drew near and knocked.



<P>A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman opened the door. In such

a



<P>voice as might be expected from a hopeless heart and fainting frame-

a



<P>voice wretchedly low and faltering- I asked if a servant was wanted



<P>here?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No,' said she; 'we do not keep a servant.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?'

I



<P>continued. 'I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place. I



<P>want some work: no matter what.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek

a place for



<P>me: besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my



<P>character, position, tale. She shook her head, she 'was sorry she



<P>could give me no information,' and the white door closed, quite gently



<P>and civilly: but it shut me out. If she had held it open a little



<P>longer, I believe I should have begged a piece of bread; for I was now



<P>brought low.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where,

besides,



<P>no prospect of aid was visible. I should have longed rather to deviate



<P>to a wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to



<P>offer inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with



<P>nature's cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there



<P>was a chance of food. Solitude would be no solitude- rest no rest-



<P>while the vulture, hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and

again I



<P>wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim



<P>to ask- no right to expect interest in my isolated lot. Meantime,



<P>the afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and



<P>starving dog. In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me:

I



<P>hastened towards it. Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a



<P>garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no doubt



<P>was the parsonage. I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place



<P>where they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply



<P>to the clergyman for introduction and aid. It is the clergyman's



<P>function to help- at least with advice- those who wished to help



<P>themselves. I seemed to have something like a right to seek counsel



<P>here. Renewing then my courage, and gathering my feeble remains of



<P>strength, I pushed on. I reached the house, and knocked at the



<P>kitchen-door. An old woman opened: I asked was this the parsonage?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Was the clergyman in?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would he be in soon?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, he was gone from home.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To a distance?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not so far- happen three mile. He had been called away

by the



<P>sudden death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very



<P>likely stay there a fortnight longer.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Was there any lady of the house?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper';

and of



<P>her, reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I



<P>was sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Once more I took off my handkerchief- once more I thought

of the



<P>cakes of bread in the little shop. Oh, for but a crust! for but one



<P>mouthful to allay the pang of famine! Instinctively I turned my face



<P>again to the village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and



<P>though others were there besides the woman I ventured the request-



<P>'Would she give me a roll for this handkerchief?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at me with evident suspicion: 'Nay, she never

sold stuff



<P>i' that way.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.



<P>'How could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?' she said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would she take my gloves?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No! what could she do with them?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some

say



<P>there is enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but



<P>at this day I can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude:



<P>the moral degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too



<P>distressing a recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on. I blamed



<P>none of those who repulsed me. I felt it was what was to be



<P>expected, and what could not be helped: an ordinary beggar is



<P>frequently an object of suspicion; a well-dressed beggar inevitably



<P>so. To be sure, what I begged was employment; but whose business was



<P>it to provide me with employment? Not, certainly, that of persons



<P>who saw me then for the first time, and who knew nothing about my



<P>character. And as to the woman who would not take my handkerchief in



<P>exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the offer appeared to



<P>her sinister or the exchange unprofitable. Let me condense now. I am



<P>sick of the subject.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A little before dark I passed a farmhouse, at the open

door of



<P>which the farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.

I



<P>stopped and said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry.'

He



<P>cast on me a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick



<P>slice from his loaf, and gave it to me. I imagine he did not think I



<P>was a beggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a



<P>fancy to his brown loaf. As soon as I was out of sight of his house,

I



<P>sat down and ate it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought

it in



<P>the wood I have before alluded to. But my night was wretched, my



<P>rest broken: the ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders



<P>passed near me more than once, and I had again and again to change



<P>my quarters: no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me. Towards



<P>morning it rained; the whole of the following day was wet. Do not



<P>ask me, reader, to give a minute account of that day; as before, I



<P>sought work; as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once



<P>did food pass my lips. At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl



<P>about to throw a mess of cold porridge into a pig trough. 'Will you



<P>give me that?' I asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She stared at me. 'Mother!' she exclaimed, 'there is a

woman



<P>wants me to give her these porridge.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, lass,' replied a voice within, 'give it her if she's

a



<P>beggar. T' pig doesn't want it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hands and

I devoured



<P>it ravenously.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary



<P>bridle-path, which I had been pursuing an hour or more.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My strength is quite failing me,' I said in a soliloquy.

'I feel I



<P>cannot go much farther. Shall I be an outcast again this night?



<P>While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched



<P>ground? I fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me? But



<P>it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness,



<P>chill, and this sense of desolation- this total prostration of hope.



<P>In all likelihood, though, I should die before morning. And why cannot



<P>I reconcile myself to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to



<P>retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester



<P>is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature



<P>cannot submit passively. Oh, Providence! sustain me a little longer!



<P>Aid!- direct me!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.

I saw I



<P>had strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight. The



<P>very cultivation surrounding it had disappeared. I had, by



<P>cross-ways and by-paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland;



<P>and now, only a few fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the



<P>heath from which they were scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and



<P>the dusky hill.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on

a



<P>frequented road,' I reflected. 'And far better that crows and



<P>ravens- if any ravens there be in these regions- should pick my



<P>flesh from my bones, than that they should be prisoned in a



<P>workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's grave.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To the hill, then, I turned. I reached it. It remained

now only



<P>to find a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden,



<P>if not secure. But all the surface of the waste looked level. It



<P>showed no variation but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew



<P>the marshes; black, where the dry soil bore only heath. Dark as it was



<P>getting, I could still see these changes, though but as mere



<P>alternations of light and shade; for colour had faded with the



<P>daylight.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the

moor-edge,



<P>vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in



<P>among the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up. 'That is an ignis



<P>fatuus,' was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.

It



<P>burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing. 'Is



<P>it, then, a bonfire just kindled?' I questioned. I watched to see



<P>whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not



<P>enlarge. 'It may be a candle in a house,' I then conjectured; 'but



<P>if so, I can never reach it. It is much too far away: and were it



<P>within a yard of me, what would it avail? I should but knock at the



<P>door to have it shut in my face.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against

the



<P>ground. I lay still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and



<P>over me, and died moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting



<P>me afresh to the skin. Could I but have stiffened to the still



<P>frost- the friendly numbness of death- it might have pelted on; I



<P>should not have felt it; but my yet living flesh shuddered at its



<P>chilling influence. I rose ere long.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through

the rain.



<P>I tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.



<P>It led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have



<P>been impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in



<P>the height of summer. Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and



<P>rallied my faculties. This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the

moor. I



<P>approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the



<P>light, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees-



<P>firs, apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of



<P>their forms and foliage through the gloom. My star vanished as I



<P>drew near: some obstacle had intervened between me and it. I put out



<P>my hand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough



<P>stones of a low wall- above it, something like palisades, and



<P>within, a high and prickly hedge. I groped on. Again a whitish



<P>object gleamed before me: it was a gate- a wicket; it moved on its



<P>hinges as I touched it. On each side stood a sable bush- holly or yew.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette

of a house



<P>rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone



<P>nowhere. All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? I feared



<P>it must be so. In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot



<P>out the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very



<P>small latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller



<P>by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves



<P>clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was



<P>set. The aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or



<P>shutter had been deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put



<P>aside the spray of foliage shooting over it, I could see all within.

I



<P>could see clearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser



<P>of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness



<P>and radiance of a glowing peat-fire. I could see a clock, a white deal



<P>table, some chairs. The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt

on



<P>the table; and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat



<P>rough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about her, was



<P>knitting a stocking.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I noticed these objects cursorily only- in them there was

nothing



<P>extraordinary. A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,



<P>sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it. Two



<P>young, graceful women- ladies in every point- sat, one in a low



<P>rocking-chair, the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning



<P>of crape and bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair



<P>necks and faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on



<P>the knee of one girl- in the lap of the other was cushioned a black



<P>cat.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!

Who



<P>were they? They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at



<P>the table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy



<P>and cultivation. I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet,



<P>as I gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament. I cannot



<P>call them handsome- they were too pale and grave for the word: as they



<P>each bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity. A



<P>stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes,

to



<P>which they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the



<P>smaller books they held in their hands, like people consulting a



<P>dictionary to aid them in the task of translation. This scene was as



<P>silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit



<P>apartment a picture: so hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall



<P>from the grate, the clock tick in its obscure corner; and I even



<P>fancied I could distinguish the click-click of the woman's



<P>knitting-needles. When, therefore, a voice broke the strange stillness



<P>at last, it was audible enough to me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Listen, Diana,' said one of the absorbed students; 'Franz

and



<P>old Daniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a



<P>dream from which he has awakened in terror- listen!' And in a low



<P>voice she read something, of which not one word was intelligible to



<P>me; for it was in an unknown tongue- neither French nor Latin. Whether



<P>it were Greek or German I could not tell.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is strong,' she said, when she had finished: 'I relish

it.'



<P>The other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister,



<P>repeated, while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.



<P>At a later day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will



<P>here quote the line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like

a



<P>stroke on sounding brass to me- conveying no meaning:-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; '"Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht."

Good!



<P>good!' she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled. 'There you



<P>have a dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you! The line is



<P>worth a hundred pages of fustian. "Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale



<P>meines Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms." I like



<P>it!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Both were again silent.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?' asked

the old



<P>woman, looking up from her knitting.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, Hannah- a far larger country than England, where

they talk in



<P>no other way.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand

t'one



<P>t'other: and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said,



<P>I guess?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We could probably tell something of what they said, but

not all-



<P>for we are not as clever as you think us, Hannah. We don't speak



<P>German, and we cannot read it without a dictionary to help us.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what good does it do you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We mean to teach it some time- or at least the elements,

as they



<P>say; and then we shall get more money than we do now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough

for



<P>to-night.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think we have: at least I'm tired. Mary, are you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a

language



<P>with no master but a lexicon.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but

glorious



<P>Deutsch. I wonder when St. John will come home.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking

at a



<P>little gold watch she drew from her girdle). It rains fast, Hannah:



<P>will you have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly

saw a



<P>passage: soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she



<P>presently came back.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah, childer!' said she, 'it fair troubles me to go into

yond' room



<P>now: it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a



<P>corner.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave

before,



<P>looked sad now.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But he is in a better place,' continued Hannah: 'we shouldn't

wish



<P>him here again. And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he



<P>had.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You say he never mentioned us?' inquired one of the ladies.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your

father.



<P>He had been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify;



<P>and when Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent



<P>for, he fair laughed at him. He began again with a bit of a



<P>heaviness in his head the next day- that is, a fortnight sin'- and



<P>he went to sleep and niver wakened: he wor a'most stark when your



<P>brother went into t' chamber and fand him. Ah, childer! that's t' last



<P>o' t' old stock- for ye and Mr. St. John is like of different soart

to



<P>them 'at's gone; for all your mother wor mich i' your way, and



<P>a'most as book-learned. She wor the pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more



<P>like your father.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old

servant



<P>(for such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference. Both were



<P>fair complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of



<P>distinction and intelligence. One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker



<P>than the other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing



<P>it; Mary's pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's



<P>duskier tresses covered her neck with thick curls. The clock struck



<P>ten.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ye'll want your supper, I am sure,' observed Hannah; 'and

so



<P>will Mr. St. John when he comes in.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And she proceeded to prepare the meal. The ladies rose;

they seemed



<P>about to withdraw to the parlour. Till this moment, I had been so



<P>intent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited



<P>in me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched



<P>position: now it recurred to me. More desolate, more desperate than



<P>ever, it seemed from contrast. And how impossible did it appear to



<P>touch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to make



<P>them believe in the truth of my wants and woes- to induce them to



<P>vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings! As I groped out the door, and



<P>knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere



<P>chimera. Hannah opened.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What do you want?' she inquired, in a voice of surprise,

as she



<P>surveyed me by the light of the candle she held.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'May I speak to your mistresses?' I said.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You had better tell me what you have to say to them. Where

do



<P>you come from?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am a stranger.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is your business here at this hour?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere,

and a morsel



<P>of bread to eat.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's

face.



<P>'I'll give you a piece of bread,' she said, after a pause; 'but we



<P>can't take in a vagrant to lodge. It isn't likely.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do let me speak to your mistresses.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, not I. What can they do for you? You should not be

roving



<P>about now; it looks very ill.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But where shall I go if you drive me away? What shall

I do?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.

Mind you



<P>don't do wrong, that's all. Here is a penny; now go-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.



<P>Don't shut the door:- oh, don't, for God's sake!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I must; the rain is driving in-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tell the young ladies. Let me see them-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed, I will not. You are not what you ought to be,

or you



<P>wouldn't make such a noise. Move off.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I must die if I am turned away.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not you. I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that

bring



<P>you about folk's houses at this time o' night. If you've any



<P>followers- housebreakers or such like- anywhere near, you may tell



<P>them we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and



<P>dogs, and guns.' Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the



<P>door to and bolted it within.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the climax. A pang of exquisite suffering- a throe

of true



<P>despair- rent and heaved my heart. Worn out, indeed, I was; not



<P>another step could I stir. I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned- I



<P>wrung my hands- I wept in utter anguish. Oh, this spectre of death!



<P>Oh, this last hour, approaching in such horror! Alas, this



<P>isolation- this banishment from my kind! Not only the anchor of



<P>hope, but the footing of fortitude was gone- at least for a moment;



<P>but the last I soon endeavoured to regain.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I can but die,' I said, 'and I believe in God. Let me

try to



<P>wait His will in silence.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting

back all



<P>my misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain



<P>there- dumb and still.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All men must die,' said a voice quite close at hand; 'but

all



<P>are not condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as



<P>yours would be if you perished here of want.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who or what speaks?' I asked, terrified at the unexpected

sound,



<P>and incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid. A



<P>form was near- what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision



<P>prevented me from distinguishing. With a loud long knock, the newcomer



<P>appealed to the door.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is it you, Mr. St. John?' cried Hannah.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes- yes; open quickly.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night

as it is!



<P>Come in- your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe



<P>there are bad folks about. There has been a beggar-woman- I declare



<P>she is not gone yet!- laid down there. Get up! for shame! Move off,



<P>I say!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hush, Hannah! I have a word to say to the woman. You have

done



<P>your duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her. I was



<P>near, and listened to both you and her. I think this is a peculiar



<P>case- I must at least examine into it. Young woman, rise, and pass



<P>before me into the house.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With difficulty I obeyed him. Presently I stood within

that



<P>clean, bright kitchen- on the very hearth- trembling, sickening;



<P>conscious of an aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and



<P>weather-beaten. The two ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old



<P>servant, were all gazing at me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'St. John, who is it?' I heard one ask.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot tell: I found her at the door,' was the reply.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She does look white,' said Hannah.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'As white as clay or death,' was responded. 'She will fall:

let her



<P>sit.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received

me. I



<P>still possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps a little water would restore her. Hannah, fetch

some.



<P>But she is worn to nothing. How very thin, and how very bloodless!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A mere spectre!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is she ill, or only famished?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Famished, I think. Hannah, is that milk? Give it me, and

a piece



<P>of bread.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping

between me



<P>and the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk,



<P>and put it to my lips. Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity

in



<P>it, and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing. In her simple words,



<P>too, the same balm-like emotion spoke: 'Try to eat.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes- try,' repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed

my sodden



<P>bonnet and lifted my head. I tasted what they offered me: feebly at



<P>first, eagerly soon.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not too much at first- restrain her,' said the brother;

'she has



<P>had enough.' And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A little more, St. John- look at the avidity in her eyes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No more at present, sister. Try if she can speak now-

ask her



<P>her name.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt I could speak, and I answered- 'My name is Jane

Elliott.'



<P>Anxious as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume

an



<P>alias.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And where do you live? Where are your friends?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was silent.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can we send for any one you know?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What account can you give of yourself?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this

house,



<P>and once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer



<P>outcast, vagrant, and disowned by the wide world. I dared to put off



<P>the mendicant- to resume my natural manner and character. I began once



<P>more to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account-



<P>which at present I was far too weak to render- I said after a brief



<P>pause-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, I can give you no details to-night.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But what, then,' said he, 'do you expect me to do for

you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing,' I replied. My strength sufficed for but short

answers.



<P>Diana took the word-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you mean,' she asked, 'that we have now given you what

aid



<P>you require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy



<P>night?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked at her. She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance,



<P>instinct both with power and goodness. I took sudden courage.



<P>Answering her compassionate gaze with a smile, I said- 'I will trust



<P>you. If I were a masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not



<P>turn me from your hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.

Do



<P>with me and for me as you like; but excuse me from much discourse-



<P>my breath is short- I feel a spasm when I speak.' All three surveyed



<P>me, and all three were silent.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hannah,' said Mr. St. John, at last, 'let her sit there

at



<P>present, and ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the



<P>remainder of that milk and bread. Mary and Diana, let us go into the



<P>parlour and talk the matter over.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They withdrew. Very soon one of the ladies returned- I

could not



<P>tell which. A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat

by



<P>the genial fire. In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.



<P>Ere long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase;

my



<P>dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me. I



<P>thanked God- experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of



<P>grateful joy- and slept.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I BOTH wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day

which



<P>followed this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet



<P>feared to meet his eye. During the early part of the morning, I



<P>momentarily expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of



<P>entering the schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes



<P>sometimes, and I had the impression that he was sure to visit it



<P>that day.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened

to interrupt



<P>the quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I



<P>heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber,



<P>Mrs. Fairfax's voice, and Leah's, and the cook's- that is, John's



<P>wife- and even John's own gruff tones. There were exclamations of



<P>'What a mercy master was not burnt in his bed!' 'It is always



<P>dangerous to keep a candle lit at night.' 'How providential that he



<P>had presence of mind to think of the water-jug!' 'I wonder he waked



<P>nobody!' 'It is to be hoped he will not take cold with sleeping on the



<P>library sofa,' etc.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and

setting to



<P>rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I



<P>saw through the open door that all was again restored to complete



<P>order; only the bed was stripped of its hangings. Leah stood up in the



<P>window-seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke. I was about



<P>to address her, for I wished to know what account had been given of



<P>the affair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber-

a



<P>woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new



<P>curtains. That woman was no other than Grace Poole.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in

her brown



<P>stuff gown, her check apron, White handkerchief, and cap. She was



<P>intent on her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on



<P>her hard forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either



<P>of the paleness or desperation one would have expected to see



<P>marking the countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose



<P>intended victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I



<P>believed), charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate. I



<P>was amazed-confounded. She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no



<P>start, no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion,



<P>consciousness of guilt, or fear of detection. She said 'Good



<P>morning, Miss,' in her usual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking



<P>up another ring and more tape, went on with her sewing.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will put her to some test,' thought I: 'such absolute



<P>impenetrability is past comprehension.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Good morning, Grace,' I said. 'Has anything happened here?

I



<P>thought I heard the servants all talking together a while ago.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he

fell asleep



<P>with his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately,



<P>he awoke before the bedclothes or the woodwork caught, and contrived



<P>to quench the flames with the water in the ewer.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A strange affair!' I said, in a low voice: then, looking

at her



<P>fixedly- 'Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody? Did no one hear him move?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was



<P>something of consciousness in their expression. She seemed to



<P>examine me warily; then she answered-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would

not be



<P>likely to hear. Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to



<P>master's; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get



<P>elderly, they often sleep heavy.' She paused, and then added, with a



<P>sort of assumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant



<P>tone- 'But you are young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper:



<P>perhaps you may have heard a noise?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I did,' said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was

still



<P>polishing the panes, could not hear me, 'and at first I thought it was



<P>Pilot: but Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and

a



<P>strange one.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully,

threaded



<P>her needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect



<P>composure-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think,

Miss, when



<P>he was in such danger: you must have been dreaming.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was not dreaming,' I said, with some warmth, for her

brazen



<P>coolness provoked me. Again she looked at me; and with the same



<P>scrutinising and conscious eye.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Have you told master that you heard a laugh?' she inquired.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this

morning.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You did not think of opening your door and looking out

into the



<P>gallery?' she further asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to

draw from me



<P>information unawares. The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew



<P>or suspected her guilt, she would be playing off some of her malignant



<P>pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'On the contrary,' said I, 'I bolted my door.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every

night



<P>before you get into bed?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her

plans



<P>accordingly!' Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied



<P>sharply, 'Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did



<P>not think it necessary. I was not aware any danger or annoyance was

to



<P>be dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future' (and I laid marked



<P>stress on the words) 'I shall take good care to make all secure before



<P>I venture to lie down.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It will be wise so to do,' was her answer: 'this neighbourhood



<P>is as quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being



<P>attempted by robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds



<P>of pounds' worth of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known. And



<P>you see, for such a large house, there are very few servants,



<P>because master has never lived here much; and when he does come, being



<P>a bachelor, he needs little waiting on: but I always think it best



<P>to err on the safe side; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well

to



<P>have a drawn bolt between one and any mischief that may be about. A



<P>deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all to Providence; but I say



<P>Providence will not dispense with the means, though He often blesses



<P>them when they are used discreetly.' And here she closed her harangue:



<P>a long one for her, and uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared

to me her



<P>miraculous self-possession, and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the



<P>cook entered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mrs. Poole,' said she, addressing Grace, 'the servants'

dinner



<P>will soon be ready: will you come down?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a

tray, and



<P>I'll carry it upstairs.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You'll have some meat?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And the sago?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before



<P>tea-time: I'll make it myself.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was

waiting



<P>for me: so I departed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain



<P>conflagration during dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my



<P>brains over the enigmatical character of Grace Poole, and still more



<P>in pondering the problem of her position at Thornfield and questioning



<P>why she had not been given into custody that morning, or, at the



<P>very least, dismissed from her master's service. He had almost as much



<P>as declared his conviction of her criminality last night: what



<P>mysterious cause withheld him from accusing her? Why had he enjoined



<P>me, too, to secrecy? It was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty



<P>gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his



<P>dependants; so much in her power, that even when she lifted her hand



<P>against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the attempt,



<P>much less punish her for it.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted

to



<P>think that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr.



<P>Rochester in her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was,



<P>the idea could not be admitted. 'Yet,' I reflected, 'she has been



<P>young once; her youth would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs.



<P>Fairfax told me once, she had lived here many years. I don't think she



<P>can ever have been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess



<P>originality and strength of character to compensate for the want of



<P>personal advantages. Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and



<P>eccentric: Grace is eccentric at least. What if a former caprice (a



<P>freak very possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has



<P>delivered him into her power, and she now exercises over his actions

a



<P>secret influence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he



<P>cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?' But, having reached this



<P>point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat figure, and uncomely,



<P>dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind's eye, that

I



<P>thought, 'No; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct. Yet,'



<P>suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, 'you



<P>are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at



<P>any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last night- remember



<P>his words; remember his look; remember his voice!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed

at the



<P>moment vividly renewed. I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was



<P>drawing; I bent over her and directed her pencil. She looked up with

a



<P>sort of start.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Qu'avez-vous, mademoiselle?' said she. 'Vos doigts tremblent

comme



<P>la feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am hot, Adele, with stooping!' She went on sketching;

I went



<P>on thinking.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had

been



<P>conceiving respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me. I compared



<P>myself with her, and found we were different. Bessie Leaven had said

I



<P>was quite a lady; and she spoke truth- I was a lady. And now I



<P>looked much better than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour



<P>and more flesh, more life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes



<P>and keener enjoyments.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Evening approaches,' said I, as I looked towards the window.

'I



<P>have never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day;



<P>but surely I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the



<P>morning; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled



<P>that it is grown impatient.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go

and play in



<P>the nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it. I listened for



<P>the bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a



<P>message; I fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and



<P>I turned to the door, expecting it to open and admit him. The door



<P>remained shut; darkness only came in through the window. Still it



<P>was not late; he often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and



<P>it was yet but six. Surely I should not be wholly disappointed



<P>to-night, when I had so many things to say to him! I wanted again to



<P>introduce the subject of Grace Poole, and to hear what he would



<P>answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if he really believed it was she



<P>who had made last night's hideous attempt; and if so, why he kept



<P>her wickedness a secret. It little mattered whether my curiosity



<P>irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and soothing him by



<P>turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure instinct always



<P>prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of provocation I



<P>never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill.



<P>Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my station,



<P>I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy restraint;



<P>this suited both him and me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A tread creaked on the stairs at last. Leah made her appearance;



<P>but it was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.



<P>Thither I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought



<P>me, I imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You must want your tea,' said the good lady, as I joined

her; 'you



<P>ate so little at dinner. I am afraid,' she continued, 'you are not



<P>well to-day: you look flushed and feverish.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, quite well! I never felt better.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will

you



<P>fill the teapot while I knit off this needle?' Having completed her



<P>task, she rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up,



<P>by way, I suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now



<P>fast deepening into total obscurity.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is fair to-night,' said she, as she looked through

the panes,



<P>'though not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a



<P>favourable day for his journey.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Journey!- Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere? I did not know

he was



<P>out.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfast! He is gone

to the



<P>Leas, Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote. I



<P>believe there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir



<P>George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and others.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you expect him back to-night?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No- nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely

to stay



<P>a week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they



<P>are so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all



<P>that can please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.



<P>Gentlemen especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr.



<P>Rochester is so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he



<P>is a general favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you



<P>would not think his appearance calculated to recommend him



<P>particularly in their eyes: but I suppose his acquirements and



<P>abilities, perhaps his wealth and good blood, make amends for any



<P>little fault of look.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Are there ladies at the Leas?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters- very elegant



<P>young ladies indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary



<P>Ingram, most beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche,



<P>six or seven years since, when she was a girl of eighteen. She came



<P>here to a Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave. You should have



<P>seen the dining-room that day- how richly it was decorated, how



<P>brilliantly lit up! I should think there were fifty ladies and



<P>gentlemen present- all of the first county families; and Miss Ingram



<P>was considered the belle of the evening.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, I saw her. The dining-room doors were thrown open;

and, as it



<P>was Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall,



<P>to hear some of the ladies sing and play. Mr. Rochester would have



<P>me to come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them. I



<P>never saw a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently



<P>dressed; most of them- at least most of the younger ones- looked



<P>handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what was she like?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck:

olive



<P>complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.



<P>Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels. And then



<P>she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly



<P>arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest,



<P>the glossiest curls I ever saw. She was dressed in pure white; an



<P>amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her



<P>breast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below



<P>her knee. She wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it



<P>contrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She was greatly admired, of course?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her



<P>accomplishments. She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman



<P>accompanied her on the piano. She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester? I was not aware he could sing.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for

music.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it

was a



<P>treat to listen to her;- and she played afterwards. I am no judge of



<P>music, but Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was



<P>remarkably good.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet

married.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have

very large



<P>fortunes. Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the



<P>eldest son came in for everything almost.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken

a fancy to



<P>her: Mr. Rochester, for instance. He is rich, is he not?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! yes. But you see there is a considerable difference

in age:



<P>Mr. Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What of that? More unequal matches are made every day.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would

entertain an



<P>idea of the sort. But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted



<P>since you began tea.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No: I am too thirsty to eat. Will you let me have another

cup?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about again to revert to the probability of a union

between



<P>Mr. Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the



<P>conversation was turned into another channel.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had

got;



<P>looked into my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and



<P>endeavoured to bring back with a strict hand such as had been straying



<P>through imagination's boundless and trackless waste, into the safe



<P>fold of common sense.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence

of the



<P>hopes, wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night- of



<P>the general state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a



<P>fortnight past; Reason having come forward and told, in her own



<P>quiet way, a plain, unvarnished tale, showing how I had rejected the



<P>real, and rabidly devoured the ideal;- I pronounced judgment to this



<P>effect:-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the

breath of



<P>life; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet



<P>lies, and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You,' I said, 'a favourite with Mr. Rochester? You gifted

with the



<P>power of pleasing him? You of importance to him in any way? Go! your



<P>folly sickens me. And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens



<P>of preference- equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a



<P>man of the world to a dependant and a novice. How dared you? Poor



<P>stupid dupe!- Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You



<P>repeated to yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?-



<P>Cover your face and be ashamed! He said something in praise of your



<P>eyes, did he? Blind puppy! Open their bleared lids and look on your



<P>own accursed senselessness! It does good to no woman to be flattered



<P>by her superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is



<P>madness in all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which,



<P>if unreturned and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and,

if



<P>discovered and responded to, must lead, ignis-fatuus-like, into miry



<P>wilds whence there is no extrication.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow,

place the



<P>glass before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully,



<P>without softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no



<P>displeasing irregularity; write under it, "Portrait of a Governess,



<P>disconnected, poor, and plain."



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory- you have one

prepared in



<P>your drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest,



<P>clearest tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils;



<P>delineate carefully the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in



<P>your softest shades and sweetest hues, according to the description



<P>given by Mrs. Fairfax of Blanche Ingram; remember the raven



<P>ringlets, the oriental eye;- What! you revert to Mr. Rochester as a



<P>model! Order! No snivel!- no sentiment!- no regret! I will endure only



<P>sense and resolution. Recall the august yet harmonious lineaments, the



<P>Grecian neck and bust; let the round and dazzling arm be visible,



<P>and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring nor gold bracelet;



<P>portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and glistening satin,



<P>graceful scarf and golden rose; call it "Blanche, an accomplished lady



<P>of rank."



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester



<P>thinks well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say,



<P>"Mr. Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he



<P>chose to strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious



<P>thought on this indigent and insignificant plebeian?"'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll do it,' I resolved: and having framed this determination,

I



<P>grew calm, and fell asleep.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I kept my word. An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own

portrait



<P>in crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory



<P>miniature of an imaginary Blanche Ingram. It looked a lovely face



<P>enough, and when compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast



<P>was as great as self-control could desire. I derived benefit from



<P>the task: it had kept my head and hands employed, and had given



<P>force and fixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp indelibly



<P>on my heart.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course

of



<P>wholesome discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.



<P>Thanks to it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a



<P>decent calm, which, had they found me unprepared, I should probably



<P>have been unequal to maintain, even externally.

CHAPTER II</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I RESISTED all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance



<P>which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot



<P>were disposed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside



<P>myself; or rather out of myself, as the French would say: I was



<P>conscious that a moment's mutiny had already rendered me liable to



<P>strange penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved,



<P>in my desperation, to go all lengths.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For shame! for shame!' cried the lady's-maid. 'What shocking



<P>conduct, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's



<P>son! Your young master.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Master! How is he my master? Am I a servant?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for

your keep.



<P>There, sit down, and think over your wickedness.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated

by Mrs.



<P>Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it



<P>like a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you don't sit still, you must be tied down,' said Bessie.

'Miss



<P>Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary



<P>ligature. This preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it



<P>inferred, took a little of the excitement out of me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't take them off,' I cried; 'I will not stir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my

hands.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mind you don't,' said Bessie; and when she had ascertained

that



<P>I was really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss



<P>Abbot stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my



<P>face, as incredulous of my sanity.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She never did so before,' at last said Bessie, turning

to the



<P>Abigail.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But it was always in her,' was the reply. 'I've told Missis



<P>often my opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me. She's



<P>an underhand little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so



<P>much cover.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations

to



<P>Mrs. Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would



<P>have to go to the poorhouse.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new

to me: my



<P>very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.



<P>This reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear:



<P>very painful and crushing, but only half intelligible. Miss Abbot



<P>joined in-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with

the Misses



<P>Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought



<P>up with them. They will have a great deal of money, and you will



<P>have none: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make



<P>yourself agreeable to them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What we tell you is for your good,' added Bessie, in no

harsh



<P>voice; 'you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you



<P>would have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude,



<P>Missis will send you away, I am sure.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Besides,' said Miss Abbot, 'God will punish her: He might

strike



<P>her dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?



<P>Come, Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for



<P>anything. Say your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for



<P>if you don't repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the



<P>chimney and fetch you away.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in,

I might



<P>say never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at



<P>Gateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the



<P>accommodation it contained: yet it was one of the largest and



<P>stateliest chambers in the mansion. A bed supported on massive pillars



<P>of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a



<P>tabernacle in the centre; the two large windows, with their blinds



<P>always drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar



<P>drapery; the carpet was red; the table at the foot of the bed was



<P>covered with a crimson cloth; the walls were a soft fawn colour with

a



<P>blush of pink in it; the wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were



<P>of darkly polished old mahogany. Out of these deep surrounding



<P>shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-up mattresses and



<P>pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane.



<P>Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the



<P>head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and



<P>looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was

silent,



<P>because remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was



<P>known to be so seldom entered. The housemaid alone came here on



<P>Saturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet



<P>dust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review



<P>the contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were



<P>stored divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her



<P>deceased husband; and in those last words lies the secret of the



<P>red-room- the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber

he



<P>breathed his last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne

by



<P>the undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary



<P>consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had

left me



<P>riveted, was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose



<P>before me; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with



<P>subdued, broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my



<P>left were the muffled windows; a great looking-glass between them



<P>repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room. I was not quite



<P>sure whether they had locked the door; and when I dared move, I got

up



<P>and went to see. Alas! yes: no jail was ever more secure. Returning,

I



<P>had to cross before the looking-glass; my fascinated glance



<P>involuntarily explored the depth it revealed. All looked colder and



<P>darker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and the strange



<P>little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and arms



<P>specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all



<P>else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one



<P>of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories



<P>represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing



<P>before the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my stool.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not

yet her



<P>hour for complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the



<P>revolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to



<P>stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the



<P>dismal present.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud



<P>indifference, all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality,



<P>turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.



<P>Why was I always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for



<P>ever condemned? Why could I never please? Why was it useless to try

to



<P>win any one's favour? Eliza, who, was headstrong and selfish, was



<P>respected. Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite,



<P>a captious and insolent carriage, was universally indulged. Her



<P>beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to



<P>all who, looked at her, and to purchase indemnity for every fault.



<P>John no one thwarted, much less punished; though he twisted the



<P>necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks, set the dogs at



<P>the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit, and broke the



<P>buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called his mother



<P>'old girl,' too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin, similar to



<P>his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore and



<P>spoiled her silk attire; and he was still 'her own darling.' I dared



<P>commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed



<P>naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and



<P>from noon to night.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had

received:



<P>no one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had



<P>turned against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was



<P>loaded with general opprobrium.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Unjust!- unjust!' said my reason, forced by the agonising

stimulus



<P>into precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally



<P>wrought up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from



<P>insupportable oppression- as running away, or, if that could not be



<P>effected, never eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!

How



<P>all my brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection! Yet in



<P>what darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I



<P>could not answer the ceaseless inward question- why I thus suffered;



<P>now, at the distance of- I will not say how many years, I see it



<P>clearly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there;

I had



<P>nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen



<P>vassalage. If they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love



<P>them. They were not bound to regard with affection a thing that



<P>could not sympathise with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing,



<P>opposed to them in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a



<P>useless thing, incapable of serving their interest, or adding to their



<P>pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at



<P>their treatment, of contempt of their judgment. I know that had I been



<P>a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child-



<P>though equally dependent and friendless- Mrs. Reed would have



<P>endured my presence more complacently; her children would have



<P>entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the



<P>servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the



<P>nursery.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four

o'clock,



<P>and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. I heard the



<P>rain still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the



<P>wind howling in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as

a



<P>stone, and then my courage sank. My habitual mood of humiliation,



<P>self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying



<P>ire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought



<P>had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? That



<P>certainly was a crime: and was I fit to die? Or was the vault under



<P>the chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne? In such vault I



<P>had been told did Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to



<P>recall his idea, I dwelt on it with gathering dread. I could not



<P>remember him; but I knew that he was my own uncle- my mother's



<P>brother- that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house;



<P>and that in his last moments he had required a promise of Mrs. Reed



<P>that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children. Mrs.



<P>Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,



<P>I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could



<P>she really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with



<P>her, after her husband's death, by any tie? It must have been most



<P>irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the



<P>stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see

an



<P>uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A singular notion dawned upon me. I doubted not- never

doubted-



<P>that if Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and



<P>now, as I sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls-



<P>occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly



<P>gleaming mirror- I began to recall what I had heard of dead men,



<P>troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes,



<P>revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the



<P>oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit, harassed by the wrongs



<P>of his sister's child, might quit its abode- whether in the church



<P>vault or in the unknown world of the departed- and rise before me in



<P>this chamber. I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs, fearful lest any



<P>sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me,



<P>or elicit from the gloom some haloed face, bending over me with



<P>strange pity. This idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be



<P>terrible if realised: with all my might I endeavoured to stifle it-



<P>I endeavoured to be firm. Shaking my hair from my eyes, I lifted my



<P>head and tried to look boldly round the dark room; at this moment a



<P>light gleamed on the wall. Was it, I asked myself, a ray from the moon



<P>penetrating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight was still, and



<P>this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling and



<P>quivered over my head. I can now conjecture readily that this streak



<P>of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by



<P>some one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for



<P>horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift



<P>darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world.

My



<P>heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I



<P>deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was



<P>oppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door



<P>and shook the lock in desperate effort. Steps came running along the



<P>outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Eyre, are you ill?' said Bessie.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!' exclaimed

Abbot.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take me out! Let me go into the nursery!' was my cry.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What for? Are you hurt? Have you seen something?' again

demanded



<P>Bessie.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come.'

I had now



<P>got hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She has screamed out on purpose,' declared Abbot, in some

disgust.



<P>'And what a scream! If she had been in great pain one would have



<P>excused it, but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her



<P>naughty tricks.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is all this?' demanded another voice peremptorily;

and Mrs.



<P>Reed came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling



<P>stormily. 'Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre



<P>should be left in the red-room till I came to her myself.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am,' pleaded Bessie.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let her go,' was the only answer. 'Loose Bessie's hand,

child: you



<P>cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured. I abhor



<P>artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that



<P>tricks will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and



<P>it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that I



<P>shall liberate you then.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'O aunt! have pity! forgive me! I cannot endure it- let

me be



<P>punished some other way! I shall be killed if-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Silence! This violence is all most repulsive:' and so,

no doubt,



<P>she felt it. I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely.



<P>looked on me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and



<P>dangerous duplicity.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient

of my now



<P>frantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me



<P>in, without farther parley. I heard her sweeping away; and soon



<P>after she was gone, I suppose I had a species of fit:



<P>unconsciousness closed the scene.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; THE next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling

as if I



<P>had had a frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red



<P>glare, crossed with thick black bars. I heard voices, too, speaking



<P>with a hollow sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water:



<P>agitation, uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror



<P>confused my faculties. Ere long, I became aware that some one was



<P>handling me; lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and



<P>that more tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before. I



<P>rested my head against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved:

I knew



<P>quite well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the



<P>nursery fire. It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie



<P>stood at the bed-foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat

in



<P>a chair near my pillow, leaning over me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of

protection



<P>and security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an



<P>individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.



<P>Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to



<P>me than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised



<P>the face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an



<P>apothecary, sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were



<P>ailing: for herself and the children she employed a physician.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, who am I?' he asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my

hand: he



<P>took it, smiling and saying, 'We shall do very well by and by.' Then



<P>he laid me down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful



<P>that I was not disturbed during the night. Having given some further



<P>directions, and intimated that he should call again the next day, he



<P>departed; to my grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat



<P>in the chair near my pillow; and as he closed the door after him,



<P>all the room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness



<P>weighed it down.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?' asked Bessie,

rather



<P>softly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence

might



<P>be rough. 'I will try.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, thank you, Bessie.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve

o'clock; but



<P>you may call me if you want anything in the night.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wonderful civility this! It emboldened me to ask a question.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Bessie, what is the matter with me? Am I ill?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying;

you'll be



<P>better soon, no doubt.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.

I heard



<P>her say-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't

for my



<P>life be alone with that poor child tonight: she might die; it's such

a



<P>strange thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw



<P>anything. Missis was rather too hard.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were



<P>whispering together for half an hour before they fell asleep. I caught



<P>scraps of their conversation, from which I was able only too



<P>distinctly to infer the main subject discussed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished'-

'A



<P>great black dog behind him'- 'Three loud raps on the chamber door'-



<P>'A light in the churchyard just over his grave,' etc., etc.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out. For

me, the



<P>watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; ear, eye,



<P>and mind were alike strained by dread: such dread as children only can



<P>feel.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident

of the



<P>red-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the



<P>reverberation to this day. Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful



<P>pangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew



<P>not what you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were



<P>only uprooting my bad propensities.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped

in a shawl



<P>by the nursery hearth. I felt physically weak and broken down: but



<P>my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a



<P>wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had



<P>I wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed. Yet, I



<P>thought, I ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there,



<P>they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama. Abbot, too,



<P>was sewing in another room, and Bessie, as she moved hither and



<P>thither, putting away toys and arranging drawers, addressed to me



<P>every now and then a word of unwonted kindness. This state of things



<P>should have been to me a paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a



<P>life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging; but, in fact, my



<P>racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe,



<P>and no pleasure excite them agreeably.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought

up with



<P>her a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of



<P>paradise, nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been



<P>wont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and



<P>which plate I had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand

in



<P>order to examine it more closely, but had always hitherto been



<P>deemed unworthy of such a privilege. This precious vessel was now



<P>placed on my knee, and I was cordially invited to eat the circlet of



<P>delicate pastry upon it. Vain favour! coming, like most other



<P>favours long deferred and often wished for, too late! I could not



<P>eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird, the tints of the flowers,



<P>seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and tart away. Bessie asked



<P>if I would have a book: the word book acted as a transient stimulus,



<P>and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from the library. This



<P>book I had again and again perused with delight. I considered it a



<P>narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper



<P>than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves, having sought



<P>them in vain among fox-glove leaves and bells, under mushrooms and



<P>beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at length made



<P>up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of England

to



<P>some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker, and the



<P>population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdingnag being, in



<P>my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I



<P>might one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the



<P>little fields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny



<P>cows, sheep, and birds of the one realm; and the corn-fields,



<P>forest-high, the mighty mastiffs, the monster cats, the tower-like men



<P>and women, of the other. Yet, when this cherished volume was now



<P>placed in my hand- when I turned over its leaves, and sought in its



<P>marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now, never failed to find-



<P>all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt goblins, the pigmies



<P>malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most



<P>dread and dangerous regions. I closed the book, which I dared no



<P>longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the untasted tart.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and

having



<P>washed her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid



<P>shreds of silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for



<P>Georgiana's doll. Meantime she sang: her song was-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

'In the days when we were gipsying,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A long time ago.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had often heard the song before, and always with lively



<P>delight; for Bessie had a sweet voice,- at least, I thought so. But



<P>now, though her voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an



<P>indescribable sadness. Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she



<P>sang the refrain very low, very lingeringly; 'A long time ago' came



<P>out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn. She passed into



<P>another ballad, this time a really doleful one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the path of the poor orphan child.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did they send me so far and so lonely,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are

piled?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam

mild,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; God, in His mercy, protection is showing,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a thought that for strength should avail me,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God is a friend to the poor orphan child.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Come, Miss Jane, don't cry,' said Bessie as she finished.

She



<P>might as well have said to the fire, 'don't burn!' but how could she



<P>divine the morbid suffering to which I was a prey? In the course of



<P>the morning Mr. Lloyd came again.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What, already up!' said he, as he entered the nursery.

'Well,



<P>nurse, how is she?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie answered that I was doing very well.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then she ought to look more cheerful. Come here, Mis Jane:

your



<P>name is Jane, is it not?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, sir, Jane Eyre.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell

me what



<P>about? Have you any pain?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh! I daresay she is crying because she could not go out

with



<P>Missis in the carriage,' interposed Bessie.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the

false



<P>charge, I answered promptly, 'I never cried for such a thing in my



<P>life: I hate going out in the carriage. I cry because I am miserable.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh fie, Miss!' said Bessie.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled. I was standing



<P>before him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small



<P>and grey; not very bright, but I daresay I should think them shrewd



<P>now: he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face. Having



<P>considered me at leisure, he said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What made you ill yesterday?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She had a fall,' said Bessie, again putting in her word.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Fall! why, that is like a baby again! Can't she manage

to walk



<P>at her age? She must be eight or nine years old.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was knocked down,' was the blunt explanation, jerked

out of me



<P>by another pang of mortified pride; 'but that did not make me ill,'



<P>I added; while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a

loud bell



<P>rang for the servants' dinner; he knew what it was. 'That's for you,



<P>nurse,' said he; 'you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture



<P>till you come back.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to

go, because



<P>punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gates-head Hall.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?' pursued

Mr.



<P>Lloyd when Bessie was gone.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after

dark.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time. 'Ghost!

What, you



<P>are a baby after all! You are afraid of ghosts?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was

laid out



<P>there. Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if



<P>they can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a



<P>candle,- so cruel that I think I shall never forget it.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable? Are you

afraid



<P>now in daylight?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No: but night will come again before long: and besides,-

I am



<P>unhappy,- very unhappy, for other things.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What other things? Can you tell me some of them?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; How much I wished to reply fully to this question! How

difficult it



<P>was to frame any answer! Children can feel, but they cannot analyse



<P>their feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in



<P>thought, they know not how to express the result of the process in



<P>words. Fearful, however, of losing this first and only opportunity



<P>of relieving my grief by imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause,



<P>contrived to frame a meagre, though, as far as it went, true response.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or

sisters.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have a kind aunt and cousins.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up

in the



<P>red-room.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?'

asked



<P>he. 'Are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right

to be



<P>here than a servant.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such

a splendid



<P>place?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave

it; but



<P>I can never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps you may- who knows? Have you any relations besides

Mrs.



<P>Reed?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think not, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'None belonging to your father?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't know: I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly

I



<P>might have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew



<P>nothing about them.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If you had such, would you like to go to them?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I reflected. Poverty looks grim to grown people; still

more so to



<P>children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable



<P>poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,



<P>scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices:



<P>poverty for me was synonymous with degradation.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; I should not like to belong to poor people,' was my

reply.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not even if they were kind to you?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the

means of



<P>being kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their



<P>manners, to be uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw



<P>sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the



<P>cottage doors of the village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough



<P>to purchase liberty at the price of caste.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But are your relatives so very poor? Are they working

people?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must

be a



<P>beggarly set: I should not like to go a-begging.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Would you like to go to school?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie



<P>sometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks,



<P>wore backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and



<P>precise: John Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John



<P>Reed's tastes were no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of



<P>school-discipline (gathered from the young ladies of a family where



<P>she had lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her



<P>details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies



<P>were, I thought, equally attractive. She boasted of beautiful



<P>paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they



<P>could sing and pieces they could play, of purses they could net, of



<P>French books they could translate; till my spirit was moved to



<P>emulation as I listened. Besides, school would be a complete change:



<P>it implied a long journey, an entire separation from Gateshead, an



<P>entrance into a new life.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I should indeed like to go to school,' was the audible



<P>conclusion of my musings.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, well! who knows what may happen?' said Mr. Lloyd,

as he



<P>got up. 'The child ought to have change of air and scene,' he added,



<P>speaking to himself; 'nerves not in a good state.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was

heard



<P>rolling up the gravel-walk.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Is that your mistress, nurse?' asked Mr. Lloyd. 'I should

like



<P>to speak to her before I go.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and

led the way



<P>out. In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I



<P>presume, from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to



<P>recommend my being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt



<P>readily enough adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject



<P>with Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was



<P>in bed, and, as they thought, asleep, 'Missis was, she dared say, glad



<P>enough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who



<P>always looked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots



<P>underhand.' Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being a sort of



<P>infantine Guy Fawkes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from

Miss



<P>Abbot's communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor



<P>clergyman; that my mother had married him against the wishes of her



<P>friends, who considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather



<P>Reed was so irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a



<P>shilling; that after my mother and father had been married a year, the



<P>latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a



<P>large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated, and where that



<P>disease was then prevalent: that my mother took the infection from



<P>him, and both died within a month of each other.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said,

'Poor



<P>Miss Jane is to be pitied too, Abbot.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' responded Abbot; 'if she were a nice, pretty child,

one



<P>might compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for



<P>such a little toad as that.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not a great deal, to be sure,' agreed Bessie: 'at any

rate, a



<P>beauty like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same



<P>condition.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!' cried the fervent Abbot.

'Little



<P>darling!- with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet



<P>colour as she has; just as if she were painted!- Bessie, I could fancy



<P>a Welsh rabbit for supper.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So could I- with a roast onion. Come, we'll go down.'

They went.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A WEEK passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten

days,



<P>and still he did not come. Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be



<P>surprised if he were to go straight from the Leas to London, and



<P>thence to the Continent, and not show his face again at Thornfield for



<P>a year to come; he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite



<P>as abrupt and unexpected. When I heard this, I was beginning to feel

a



<P>strange chill and failing at the heart. I was actually permitting



<P>myself to experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying



<P>my wits, and recollecting my principles, I at once called my



<P>sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary



<P>blunder- how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester's



<P>movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital



<P>interest. Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of



<P>inferiority: on the contrary, I just said-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield,

further than



<P>to receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to



<P>be grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do



<P>your duty, you have a right to expect at his hands. Be sure that is



<P>the only tie he seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't



<P>make him the object of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and



<P>so forth. He is not of your order: keep to your caste, and be too



<P>self-respecting to lavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and



<P>strength, where such a gift is not wanted and would be despised.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and

anon



<P>vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I



<P>should quit Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing



<P>advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations: these



<P>thoughts I did not think it necessary to check; they might germinate



<P>and bear fruit if they could.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when

the post



<P>brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is from the master,' said she, as she looked at the



<P>direction. 'Now I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his



<P>return or not.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And while she broke the seal and perused the document,

I went on



<P>taking my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I



<P>attributed to that circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to

my



<P>face. Why my hand shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the



<P>contents of my cup into my saucer, I did not choose to consider.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a

chance of



<P>being busy enough now: for a little while at least,' said Mrs.



<P>Fairfax, still holding the note before her spectacles.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied

the string



<P>of Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her



<P>also to another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said



<P>nonchalantly-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Indeed he is- in three days, he says: that will be next



<P>Thursday; and not alone either. I don't know how many of the fine



<P>people at the Leas are coming with him: he sends directions for all



<P>the best bedrooms to be prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms



<P>are to be cleaned out; and I am to get more kitchen hands from the



<P>George Inn, at Millcote, and from wherever else I can; and the



<P>ladies will bring their maids and the gentlemen their valets: so we



<P>shall have a full house of it.' And Mrs. Fairfax swallowed her



<P>breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.

I had



<P>thought all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well



<P>arranged; but it appears I was mistaken. Three women were got to help;



<P>and such scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating



<P>of carpets, such taking down and putting up of pictures, such



<P>polishing of mirrors and lustres, such lighting of fires in



<P>bedrooms, such airing of sheets and feather-beds on hearths, I never



<P>beheld, either before or since. Adele ran quite wild in the midst of



<P>it: the preparations for company and the prospect of their arrival,



<P>seemed to throw her into ecstasies. She would have Sophie to look over



<P>all her 'toilettes,' as she called frocks; to furbish up any that were



<P>'passees,' and to air and arrange the new. For herself, she did



<P>nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump on and off the



<P>bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters and pillows



<P>before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys. From school



<P>duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her



<P>service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering)



<P>her and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and



<P>French pastry, to truss game and garnish dessert-dishes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon,

in time



<P>for dinner at six. During the intervening period I had no time to



<P>nurse chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody-



<P>Adele excepted. Still, now and then, I received a damping check to



<P>my cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the



<P>region of doubts and portents, and dark conjectures. This was when I



<P>chanced to see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had



<P>always been kept locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form



<P>of Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I



<P>watched her glide along the gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list



<P>slipper; when I saw her look into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,-



<P>just say a word, perhaps, to the charwoman about the proper way to



<P>polish a grate, or clean a marble mantelpiece, or take stains from



<P>papered walls, and then pass on. She would thus descend to the kitchen



<P>once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth, and



<P>go back, carrying her pot of porter with her, for her private



<P>solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt. Only one hour in the



<P>twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all the



<P>rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the



<P>second storey: there she sat and sewed- and probably laughed



<P>drearily to herself,- as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the

house,



<P>except me, noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one



<P>discussed her position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or



<P>isolation. I once, indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah



<P>and one of the charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject. Leah



<P>had been saying something I had not caught, and the charwoman



<P>remarked-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She gets good wages, I guess?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' said Leah; 'I wish I had as good; not that mine

are to



<P>complain of,- there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one



<P>fifth of the sum Mrs. Poole receives. And she is laying by: she goes



<P>every quarter to the bank at Millcote. I should not wonder but she has



<P>saved enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I



<P>suppose she's got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and



<P>strong and able for anything. It is too soon for her to give up



<P>business.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'She is a good hand, I daresay,' said the charwoman.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ah!- she understands what she has to do,- nobody better,'

rejoined



<P>Leah significantly; 'and it is not every one could fill her shoes- not



<P>for all the money she gets.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That it is not!' was the reply. 'I wonder whether the

master-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived



<P>me, and she instantly gave her companion a nudge.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Doesn't she know?' I heard the woman whisper.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course

dropped.



<P>All I had gathered from it amounted to this,- that there was a mystery



<P>at Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was



<P>purposely excluded.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous

evening;



<P>carpets were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white



<P>counterpanes spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers



<P>piled in vases: both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright



<P>as hands could make them. The hall, too, was scoured; and the great



<P>carved clock, as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase,



<P>were polished to the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the



<P>sideboard flashed resplendent with plate; in the drawing-room and



<P>boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all sides.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black

satin



<P>gown, her gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive



<P>the company,- to conduct the ladies to their rooms, etc. Adele, too,



<P>would be dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being



<P>introduced to the party that day at least. However, to please her, I



<P>allowed Sophie to apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.



<P>For myself, I had no need to make any change; I should not be called



<P>upon to quit my sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now



<P>become to me,- 'a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It had been a mild, serene spring day- one of those days

which,



<P>towards the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining



<P>over the earth as heralds of summer. It was drawing to an end now; but



<P>the evening was even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with



<P>the window open.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It gets late,' said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling

state. 'I



<P>am glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester



<P>mentioned; for it is past six now. I have sent John down to the



<P>gates to see if there is anything on the road: one can see a long



<P>way from thence in the direction of Millcote.' She went to the window.



<P>'Here he is!' said she. 'Well, John' (leaning out), 'any news?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They're coming, ma'am,' was the answer. 'They'll be here

in ten



<P>minutes.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele flew to the window. I followed, taking care to stand

on one



<P>side, so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being



<P>seen.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at

last wheels



<P>were heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them



<P>came two open carriages. Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the



<P>vehicles; two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking



<P>gentlemen; the third was Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour,



<P>Pilot bounding before him; at his side rode a lady, and he and she



<P>were the first of the party. Her purple riding-habit almost swept the,



<P>ground, her veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with its



<P>transparent folds, and gleaming through them, shone rich raven



<P>ringlets.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Ingram!' exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried

to



<P>her post below.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly

turned the



<P>angle of the house, and I lost sight of it. Adele now petitioned to

go



<P>down; but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she



<P>must not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies,



<P>either now or at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr.



<P>Rochester would be very angry, etc. 'Some natural tears she shed' on



<P>being told this; but as I began to look very grave, she consented at



<P>last to wipe them.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's

deep tones



<P>and ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and



<P>distinguishable above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice



<P>of the master of Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant



<P>guests under its roof. Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there



<P>was a tripping through the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and



<P>opening and closing doors, and, for a time, a hush.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Elles changent de toilettes,' said Adele; who, listening



<P>attentively, had followed every movement; and she sighed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Chez maman,' said she, 'quand il y avait du monde, je

le suivais



<P>partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes



<P>de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme



<P>cela on apprend.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't you feel hungry, Adele?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous



<P>n'avons pas mange.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will

venture down



<P>and get you something to eat.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a

backstairs



<P>which conducted directly to the kitchen. All in that region was fire



<P>and commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection,



<P>and the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body



<P>threatening spontaneous combustion. In the servants' hall two coachmen



<P>and three gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the



<P>abigails, I suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new



<P>servants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling about



<P>everywhere. Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder;



<P>there I took possession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some



<P>tarts, a plate or two and a knife and fork: with this booty I made a



<P>hasty retreat. I had regained the gallery, and was just shutting the



<P>back-door behind me, when an accelerated hum warned me that the ladies



<P>were about to issue from their chambers. I could not proceed to the



<P>schoolroom without passing some of their doors, and running the risk



<P>of being surprised with my cargo of victualage; so I stood still at



<P>this end, which, being windowless, was dark: quite dark now, for the



<P>sun was set and twilight gathering.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after



<P>another: each came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed



<P>lustrous through the dusk. For a moment they stood grouped together

at



<P>the other extremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet



<P>subdued vivacity: they then descended the staircase almost as



<P>noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down a hill. Their collective



<P>appearance had left on me an impression of high-born elegance, such

as



<P>I had never before received.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which

she held



<P>ajar. 'What beautiful ladies!' cried she in English. 'Oh, I wish I



<P>might go to them! Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by and



<P>by, after dinner?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else

to think



<P>about. Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them



<P>to-morrow: here is your dinner.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served

to divert



<P>her attention for a time. It was well I secured this forage, or both



<P>she, I, and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would



<P>have run a chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs



<P>was too much engaged to think of us. The dessert was not carried out



<P>till after nine, and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with



<P>trays and coffee-cups. I allowed Adele to sit up much later than



<P>usual; for she declared she could not possibly go to sleep while the



<P>doors kept opening and shutting below, and people bustling about.



<P>Besides, she added, a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester



<P>when she was undressed; 'et alors quel dommage!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I told her stories as long as she would listen to them;

and then



<P>for a change I took her out into the gallery. The hall lamp was now



<P>lit, and it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the



<P>servants passing backwards and forwards. When the evening was far



<P>advanced, a sound of music issued from the drawing-room, whither the



<P>piano had been removed; Adele and I sat down on the top step of the



<P>stairs to listen. Presently a voice blent with the rich tones of the



<P>instrument; it was a lady who sang, and very sweet her notes were. The



<P>solo over, a duet followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational



<P>murmur filled up the intervals. I listened long: suddenly I discovered



<P>that my ear was wholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and



<P>trying to discriminate amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr.



<P>Rochester; and when it caught them, which it soon did, it found a



<P>further task in framing the tones, rendered by distance



<P>inarticulate, into words.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The clock struck eleven. I looked at Adele, whose head

leant



<P>against my shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in



<P>my arms and carried her off to bed. It was near one before the



<P>gentlemen and ladies sought their chambers.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted

by



<P>the party to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood. They



<P>set out early in the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in



<P>carriages; I witnessed both the departure and the return. Miss Ingram,



<P>as before, was the only lady equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester



<P>galloped at her side; the two rode a little apart from the rest. I



<P>pointed out this circumstance to Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the



<P>window with me-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You said it was not likely they should think of being

married,'



<P>said I, 'but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the



<P>other ladies.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And she him,' I added; 'look how she leans her head towards

him as



<P>if she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face;



<P>I have never had a glimpse of it yet.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You will see her this evening,' answered Mrs. Fairfax.

'I happened



<P>to remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to



<P>the ladies, and he said: "Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after



<P>dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her."'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go,

I am sure,'



<P>I answered.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company,

I



<P>did not think you would like appearing before so gay a party- all



<P>strangers; and he replied, in his quick way- "Nonsense! If she



<P>objects, tell her it is my particular wish; and if she resists, say



<P>I shall come and fetch her in case of contumacy."'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will not give him that trouble,' I answered. 'I will

go, if no



<P>better may be; but I don't like it. Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea. I'll tell

you how to



<P>manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance,



<P>which is the most disagreeable part of the business. You must go



<P>into the drawing-room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the



<P>dinner-table; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need



<P>not stay long after the gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let



<P>Mr. Rochester see you are there and then slip away- nobody will notice



<P>you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Will these people remain long, do you think?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more. After

the Easter



<P>recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote,



<P>will have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr.



<P>Rochester will accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made



<P>so protracted a stay at Thornfield.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour

approach



<P>when I was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room. Adele had



<P>been in a state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be



<P>presented to the ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie



<P>commenced the operation of dressing her that she sobered down. Then



<P>the importance of the process quickly steadied her, and by the time



<P>she had her curls arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her



<P>pink satin frock put on, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens



<P>adjusted, she looked as grave as any judge. No need to warn her not

to



<P>disarrange her attire: when she was dressed, she sat demurely down



<P>in her little chair, taking care previously to lift up the satin skirt



<P>for fear she should crease it, and assured me she would not stir



<P>thence till I was ready. This I quickly was: my best dress (the



<P>silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's wedding, and never worn



<P>since) was soon put on; my hair was soon smoothed; my sole ornament,



<P>the pearl brooch, soon assumed. We descended.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room

than



<P>that through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner. We found



<P>the apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble



<P>hearth, and wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite



<P>flowers with which the tables were adorned. The crimson curtain hung



<P>before the arch: slight as was the separation this drapery formed from



<P>the party in the adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that



<P>nothing of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing



<P>murmur.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of

a most



<P>solemnising impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I



<P>pointed out to her. I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from



<P>a table near, endeavoured to read. Adele brought her stool to my feet;



<P>ere long she touched my knee.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What is it, Adele?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendre une seule de ces fleurs



<P>magnifiques, mademoiselle? Seulement pour completer ma toilette.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You think too much of your "toilette," Adele: but you

may have a



<P>flower.' And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.



<P>She sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of



<P>happiness were now full. I turned my face away to conceal a smile I



<P>could not suppress: there was something ludicrous as well as painful



<P>in the little Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of



<P>dress.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain

was swept



<P>back from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its



<P>lit lustre pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent



<P>dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the



<P>opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in,

they gave



<P>the impression of a much larger number. Some of them were very tall;



<P>many were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of



<P>array that seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the



<P>moon. I rose and curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in



<P>return, the others only stared at me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness

and



<P>buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds. Some



<P>of them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas



<P>and ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and



<P>books: the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a



<P>low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them. I knew their names



<P>afterwards, and may as well mention them now.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.

She had



<P>evidently been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still. Of



<P>her daughters, the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and



<P>child-like in face and manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin



<P>dress and blue sash became her well. The second, Louisa, was taller



<P>and more elegant in figure; with a very pretty face, of that order the



<P>French term minois chiffone: both sisters were fair as lilies.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty,

very



<P>erect, very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of



<P>changeful sheen: her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an



<P>azure plume, and within the circlet of a band of gems.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more

lady-like.



<P>She had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair. Her black



<P>satin dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl



<P>ornaments, pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled



<P>dame.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the three most distinguished- partly, perhaps, because

the



<P>tallest figures of the band- were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her



<P>daughters, Blanche and Mary. They were all three of the loftiest



<P>stature of women. The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her



<P>shape was still fine; her hair (by candlelight at least) still



<P>black; her teeth, too, were still apparently perfect. Most people



<P>would have termed her a splendid woman of her age: and so she was,



<P>no doubt, physically speaking; but then there was an expression of



<P>almost insupportable haughtiness in her bearing and countenance. She



<P>had Roman features and a double chin, disappearing into a throat



<P>like a pillar: these features appeared to me not only inflated and



<P>darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the chin was sustained



<P>by the same principle, in a position of almost preternatural



<P>erectness. She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it reminded



<P>me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice was



<P>deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,- very



<P>intolerable, in short. A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of



<P>some gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she



<P>thought) with a truly imperial dignity.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,- straight and tall

as



<P>poplars. Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded



<P>like a Dian. I regarded her, of course, with special interest.



<P>First, I wished to see whether her appearance accorded with Mrs.



<P>Fairfax's description; secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy



<P>miniature I had painted of her; and thirdly- it will out!- whether



<P>it were such as I should fancy likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as person went, she answered point for point, both

to my



<P>picture and Mrs. Fairfax's description. The noble bust, the sloping



<P>shoulders, the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were



<P>all there;- but her face? Her face was like her mother's; a youthful



<P>unfurrowed likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the



<P>same pride. It was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed



<P>continually; her laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual



<P>expression of her arched and haughty lip.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Genius is said to be self-conscious. I cannot tell whether

Miss



<P>Ingram was a genius, but she was self-conscious- remarkably



<P>self-conscious indeed. She entered into a discourse on botany with the



<P>gentle Mrs. Dent. It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science:



<P>though, as she said, she liked flowers, 'especially wild ones'; Miss



<P>Ingram had, and she ran over its vocabulary with an air. I presently



<P>perceived she was (what is vernacularly termed) trailing Mrs. Dent;



<P>that is, playing on her ignorance: her trail might be clever, but it



<P>was decidedly not good-natured. She played: her execution was



<P>brilliant; she sang, her voice was fine; she talked French apart to



<P>her mama; and she talked it well, with fluency and with a good accent.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche;

softer



<P>features too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as

a



<P>Spaniard)- but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,



<P>her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her



<P>seat, remained fixed like a statue in its niche. The sisters were both



<P>attired in spotless white.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester



<P>would be likely to make? I could not tell- I did not know his taste

in



<P>female beauty. If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of



<P>majesty: then she was accomplished, sprightly. Most gentlemen would



<P>admire her, I thought; and that he did admire her, I already seemed

to



<P>have obtained proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained



<P>but to see them together.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this

time been



<P>sitting motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies



<P>entered, she rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence,



<P>and said with gravity-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Bon jour, mesdames.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air,

and



<P>exclaimed, 'Oh, what a little puppet!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Lynn had remarked, 'It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I

suppose- the



<P>little French girl he was speaking of.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.

Amy



<P>and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What a love of a child!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat,



<P>ensconced between them, chattering alternately in French and broken



<P>English; absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of



<P>Mrs. Eshton and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.

I sit



<P>in the shade- if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment;



<P>the window-curtain half hides me. Again the arch yawns; they come. The



<P>collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is



<P>very imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are



<P>tall, some young. Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks



<P>indeed; and Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man. Mr. Eshton, the



<P>magistrate of the district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite



<P>white, his eyebrows and whiskers still dark, which gives him something



<P>of the appearance of a 'pere noble de theatre.' Lord Ingram, like



<P>his sisters, is very tall; like them, also, he is handsome; but he



<P>shares Mary's apathetic and listless look: he seems to have more



<P>length of limb than vivacity of blood or vigour of brain.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And where is Mr. Rochester?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see

him



<P>enter. I try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles,



<P>on the meshes of the purse I am forming- I wish to think only of the



<P>work I have in my hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads



<P>that lie in my lap; whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I



<P>inevitably recall the moment when I last saw it; just after I had



<P>rendered him, what he deemed, an essential service, and he, holding

my



<P>hand, and looking down on my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed



<P>a heart full and eager to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.



<P>How near had I approached him at that moment! What had occurred since,



<P>calculated to change his and my relative positions? Yet now, how



<P>distant, how far estranged we were! So far estranged, that I did not



<P>expect him to come and speak to me. I did not wonder, when, without



<P>looking at me, he took a seat at the other side of the room, and began



<P>conversing with some of the ladies.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them,

and



<P>that I might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn



<P>involuntarily to his face; I could not keep their lids under



<P>control: they would rise, and the irids would fix on him. I looked,



<P>and had an acute pleasure in looking,- a precious yet poignant



<P>pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like



<P>what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which



<P>he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts



<P>nevertheless.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most true is it that 'beauty is in the eye of the gazer.'

My



<P>master's colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty



<P>eyebrows, deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,- all energy,



<P>decision, will,- were not beautiful, according to rule; but they



<P>were more than beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an



<P>influence that quite mastered me,- that took my feelings from my own



<P>power and fettered them in his. I had not intended to love him; the



<P>reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs

of



<P>love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they



<P>spontaneously arrived, green and strong! He made me love him without



<P>looking at me.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I compared him with his guests. What was the gallant grace

of the



<P>Lynns, the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,- even the military



<P>distinction of Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith



<P>and genuine power? I had no sympathy in their appearance, their



<P>expression: yet I could imagine that most observers would call them



<P>attractive, handsome, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr.



<P>Rochester at once harsh-featured and melancholy-looking. I saw them



<P>smile, laugh- it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much



<P>soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance



<P>as their laugh. I saw Mr. Rochester smile:- his stern features



<P>softened; his eye grew both brilliant and gentle, its ray both



<P>searching and sweet. He was talking, at the moment, to Louisa and



<P>Amy Eshton. I wondered to see them receive with calm that look which



<P>seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall, their



<P>colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in no



<P>sense moved. 'He is not to them what he is to me,' I thought: 'he is



<P>not of their kind. I believe he is of mine;- I am sure he is- I feel



<P>akin to him- I understand the language of his countenance and



<P>movements: though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something

in



<P>my brain and heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me



<P>mentally to him. Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to

do



<P>with him but to receive my salary at his hands? Did I forbid myself

to



<P>think of him in any other light than as a paymaster? Blasphemy against



<P>nature! Every good, true, vigorous feeling I have gathers



<P>impulsively round him. I know I must conceal my sentiments: I must



<P>smother hope; I must remember that he cannot care much for me. For



<P>when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I have his



<P>force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean only that I



<P>have certain tastes and feelings in common with him. I must, then,



<P>repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:- and yet, while I



<P>breathe and think, I must love him.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Coffee is handed. The ladies, since the gentlemen entered,

have



<P>become lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry. Colonel



<P>Dent and Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen. The two



<P>proud dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together. Sir



<P>George- whom, by the bye, I have forgotten to describe,- a very big,



<P>and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa,



<P>coffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word. Mr. Frederick



<P>Lynn has taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the



<P>engravings of a splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but



<P>apparently says little. The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with



<P>folded arms on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she



<P>glances up at him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than



<P>she does Mr. Rochester. Henry Lynn has taken possession of an



<P>ottoman at the feet of Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is



<P>trying to talk French with her, and Louisa laughs at his blunders.



<P>With whom will Blanche Ingram pair? She is standing alone at the



<P>table, bending gracefully over an album. She seems waiting to be



<P>sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself selects a mate.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the

hearth



<P>as solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking



<P>her station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nor am I.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little

doll as



<P>that?' (pointing to Adele). 'Where did you pick her up?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You should have sent her to school.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I could not afford it: schools are so dear.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person

with



<P>her just now- is she gone? Oh, no! there she is still, behind the



<P>window-curtain. You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as



<P>expensive,- more so; for you have them both to keep in addition.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I feared- or should I say, hoped?- the allusion to me would

make



<P>Mr. Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into



<P>the shade: but he never turned his eyes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have not considered the subject,' said he indifferently,

looking



<P>straight before him.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.

You should



<P>hear mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should



<P>think, a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the



<P>rest ridiculous, and all incubi- were they not, mama?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you speak, my own?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property,



<P>reiterated her question with an explanation.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes

me



<P>nervous. I have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and



<P>caprice. I thank Heaven I have now done with them!'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady, and whispered

something



<P>in her car; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder



<P>that one of the anathematised race was present.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tant pis!' said her ladyship, 'I hope it may do her good!'

Then,



<P>in a lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, 'I noticed her;



<P>I am a judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her



<P>class.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What are they, madam?' inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I will tell you in your private ear,' replied she, wagging

her



<P>turban three times with portentous significancy.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves

food now.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, don't refer him to me, mama! I have just one word

to say of



<P>the whole tribe; they are a nuisance. Not that I ever suffered much



<P>from them; I took care to turn the tables. What tricks Theodore and



<P>I used to play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame



<P>Jouberts! Mary was always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.



<P>The best fun was with Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly



<P>thing, lachrymose and low-spirited, not worth the trouble of



<P>vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey was coarse and insensible; no



<P>blow took effect on her. But poor Madame Joubert! I see her yet in her



<P>raging passions, when we had driven her to extremities- spilt our tea,



<P>crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our books up to the ceiling, and



<P>played a charivari with the ruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons.



<P>Theodore, do you remember those merry days?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yaas, to be sure I do,' drawled Lord Ingram; 'and the

poor old



<P>stick used to cry out "Oh you villains childs!"- and then we



<P>sermonised her on the presumption of attempting to teach such clever



<P>blades as we were, when she was herself so ignorant.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting

(or



<P>persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining- the parson in the pip,



<P>as we used to call him. He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling



<P>in love with each other- at least Tedo and I thought so; we



<P>surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as



<P>tokens of "la belle passion," and I promise you the public soon had



<P>the benefit of our discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to



<P>hoist our dead-weights from the house. Dear mama, there, as soon as



<P>she got an inkling of the business, found out that it was of an



<P>immoral tendency. Did you not, my lady-mother?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Certainly, my best. And I was quite right: depend on that:

there



<P>are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors



<P>should never be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house;



<P>firstly-'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, gracious, mama! Spare us the enumeration! Au reste,

we all



<P>know them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood;



<P>distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the part of the



<P>attached- mutual alliance and reliance; confidence thence resulting-



<P>insolence accompanying- mutiny and general blowup. Am I right,



<P>Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My lily-flower, you are right now, as always.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then no more need be said: change the subject.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined

in



<P>with her soft, infantine tone: 'Louisa and I used to quiz our



<P>governess too; but she was such a good creature, she would bear



<P>anything: nothing put her out. She was never cross with us; was she,



<P>Louisa?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk

and her



<P>workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,



<P>she would give us anything we asked for.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I suppose, now,' said Miss Ingram, curling her lip



<P>sarcastically, 'we shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the



<P>governesses extant: in order to avert such a visitation, I again



<P>move the introduction of a new topic. Mr. Rochester, do you second



<P>my motion?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward. Signior

Eduardo,



<P>are you in voice to-night?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish

up your



<P>lungs and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal



<P>service.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A fig for Rizzio!' cried she, tossing her head with all

its curls,



<P>as she moved to the piano. 'It is my opinion the fiddler David must



<P>have been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better:



<P>to my mind a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and



<P>history may say what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion,

he



<P>was just the sort of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have



<P>consented to gift with my hand.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Gentlemen, you hear! Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?'



<P>cried Mr. Rochester.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I should say the preference lies with you,' responded

Colonel



<P>Dent.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'On my honour, I am much obliged to you,' was the reply.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace

at the



<P>piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced

a



<P>brilliant prelude; talking meantime. She appeared to be on her high



<P>horse to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite



<P>not only the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was



<P>evidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring



<P>indeed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!'

exclaimed



<P>she, rattling away at the instrument. 'Poor, puny things, not fit to



<P>stir a step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without



<P>mama's permission and guardianship! Creatures so absorbed in care



<P>about their pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet;



<P>as if a man had anything to do with beauty! As if loveliness were



<P>not the special prerogative of woman- her legitimate appanage and



<P>heritage! I grant an ugly woman is a blot on the fair face of



<P>creation; but as to the gentlemen, let them be solicitous to possess



<P>only strength and valour: let their motto be:- Hunt, shoot, and fight:



<P>the rest is not worth a fillip. Such should be my device, were I a



<P>man.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whenever I marry,' she continued after a pause which none



<P>interrupted, 'I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a



<P>foil to me. I will suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact



<P>an undivided homage: his devotions shall not be shared between me



<P>and the shape he sees in his mirror. Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I



<P>will play for you.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am all obedience,' was the response.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Here then is a Corsair-song. Know that I doat on Corsairs;

and for



<P>that reason, sing it con spirito.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into

a mug of



<P>milk and water.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame

you by



<P>showing how such things should be done.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now

endeavour to



<P>fail.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Gardez-vous en bien! If you err wilfully, I shall devise

a



<P>proportionate punishment.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her

power to



<P>inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ha! explain!' commanded the lady.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine

sense must



<P>inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute



<P>for capital punishment.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sing!' said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced

an



<P>accompaniment in spirited style.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now is my time to slip away,' thought I: but the tones

that then



<P>severed the air arrested me. Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester



<P>possessed a fine voice: he did- a mellow, powerful bass, into which

he



<P>threw his own feeling, his own force: finding a way through the ear

to



<P>the heart, and there waking sensation strangely. I waited till the



<P>last deep and full vibration had expired- till the tide of talk,



<P>checked an instant, had resumed its flow; I then quitted my



<P>sheltered corner and made my exit by the side-door, which was



<P>fortunately near. Thence a narrow passage led into the hall: in



<P>crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped to tie it,



<P>kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the



<P>staircase. I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;



<P>rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'How do you do?' he asked.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am very well, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I might have retorted the question on him who

put it: but



<P>I would not take that freedom. I answered-



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged,

sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What have you been doing during my absence?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And getting a good deal paler than you were- as I saw

at first



<P>sight. What is the matter?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing at all, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not the least.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am tired, sir.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at me for a minute.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And a little depressed,' he said. 'What about? Tell me.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nothing- nothing, sir. I am not depressed.'



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few

more words



<P>would bring tears to your eyes- indeed, they are there now, shining



<P>and swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to



<P>the flag. If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating



<P>prig of a servant passing, I would know what all this means. Well,



<P>to-night I excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors



<P>stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it



<P>is my wish; don't neglect it. Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.



<P>Good-night, my-' He stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me.
