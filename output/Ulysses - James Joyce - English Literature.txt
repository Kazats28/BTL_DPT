BRONZE BY GOLD HEARD THE HOOFIRONS, STEELYRINING IMPERthnthn thnthnthn.



<P>Chips, picking chips off rocky thumbnail, chips. Horrid! And gold flushed

more.



<P>A husky fifenote blew.



<P>Blew. Blue bloom is on the



<P>Gold pinnacled hair.



<P>A jumping rose on satiny breasts of satin, rose of Castille.



<P>Trilling, trilling: I dolores.



<P>Peep! Who's in the... peepofgold?



<P>Tink cried to bronze in pity.



<P>And a call, pure, long and throbbing. Longindying call.



<P>Decoy. Soft word. But look! The bright stars fade. O rose! Notes chirruping

answer. Castille. The morn is breaking.



<P>Jingle jingle jaunted jingling.



<P>Coin rang. Clock clacked.



<P>Avowal. <I>Sonnez</I>. I could. Rebound of garter. Not leave thee. Smack.

<I>La cloche!</I> Thigh smack. Avowal. Warm. Sweetheart, goodbye!



<P>Jingle. Bloo.



<P>Boomed crashing chords. When love absorbs. War! War! The tympanum.



<P>A sail! A veil awave upon the waves.



<P>Lost. Throstle fluted. All is lost now.



<P>Horn. Hawhorn.



<P>When first he saw. Alas!



<P>Full tup. Full throb.



<P>Warbling. Ah, lure! Alluring.



<P>Martha! Come!



<P>Clapclop. Clipclap. Clappyclap.



<P>Goodgod henev erheard inall.



<P>Deaf bald Pat brought pad knife took up.



<P>A moonlight nightcall: far: far.



<P>I feel so sad. P. S. So lonely blooming.



<P>Listen!



<P>The spiked and winding cold seahorn. Have you the? Each and for other

plash and silent roar.



<P>Pearls: when she. Liszt's rhapsodies. Hissss.



<P>You don't?



<P>Did not: no, no: believe: Lidlyd. With a cock with a carra.



<P>Black.



<P>Deepsounding. Do, Ben, do.



<P>Wait while you wait. Hee hee. Wait while you hee.



<P>But wait!



<P>Low in dark middle earth. Embedded ore.



<P>Naminedamine. All gone. All fallen.



<P>Tiny, her tremulous fernfoils of maidenhair.



<P>Amen! He gnashed in fury.



<P>Fro. To, fro. A baton cool protruding.



<P>Bronzelydia by Minagold.



<P>By bronze, by gold, in oceangreen of shadow. Bloom. Old Bloom.



<P>One rapped, one tapped with a carra, with a cock.



<P>Pray for him! Pray, good people!



<P>His gouty fingers nakkering.



<P>Big Benaben. Big Benben.



<P>Last rose Castille of summer left bloom I feel so sad alone. Pwee! Little

wind piped wee.



<P>True men. Lid Ker Cow De and Doll. Ay, ay. Like you men. Will lift your

tschink with tschunk.



<P>Fff! Oo!



<P>Where bronze from anear? Where gold from afar? Where hoofs?



<P>Rrrpr. Kraa. Kraandl.



<P>Then, not till then. My eppripfftaph. Be pfrwritt.



<P>Done.



<P>Begin!



<P>Bronze by gold, Miss Douce's head by Miss Kennedy's head, over the crossblind

of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.



<P>-- Is that her? asked Miss Kennedy.



<P>Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and <I>eau de Nil</I>.



<P>-- Exquisite contrast, Miss Kennedy said.



<P>When all agog Miss Douce said eagerly:



<P>-- Look at the fellow in the tall silk.



<P>-- Who? Where? gold asked more eagerly.



<P>-- In the second carriage, Miss Douce's wet lips said, laughing in the

sun. He's looking. Mind till I see.



<P>She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against

the pane in a halo of hurried breath.



<P>Her wet lips tittered:



<P>-- He's killed looking back.



<P>She laughed:



<P>-- O wept! Aren't men frightful idiots?



<P>With sadness.



<P>Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair

behind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.

Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.



<P>-- It's them has the fine times, sadly then she said.



<P>A man.



<P>Bloowho went by by Moulang's pipes, bearing in his breast the sweets

of sin, by Wine's antiques in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll's

dusky battered plate, for Raoul.



<P>The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them unheeding

him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And



<P>-- There's your teas, he said.



<P>Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned

lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.



<P>-- What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.



<P>-- Find out, Miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.



<P>-- Your <I>beau</I>, is it?



<P>A haughty bronze replied:



<P>-- I'll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your

impertinent insolence.



<P>-- I mperthnthn thnthnthn, bootsnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated

as she threatened as he had come.



<P>Bloom.



<P>On her flower frowning Miss Douce said:



<P>-- Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn't conduct himself

I'll wring his ear for him a yard long.



<P>Ladylike in exquisite contrast.



<P>-- Take no notice, Miss Kennedy rejoined.



<P>She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered

under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting

for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black satin,

two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.



<P>Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs

ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.



<P>-- Am I awfully sunburnt?



<P>Miss Bronze unbloused her neck.



<P>-- No, said Miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax

with the cherry laurel water?



<P>Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered

where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell.



<P>-- And leave it to my hands, she said.



<P>-- Try it with the glycerine, Miss Kennedy advised.



<P>Bidding her neck and hands adieu Miss Douce



<P>-- Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that

old fogey in Boyd's for something for my skin.



<P>Miss Kennedy, pouring now fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:



<P>-- O, don't remind me of him for mercy'sake!



<P>-- But wait till I tell you, Miss Douce entreated.



<P>Sweet tea Miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears

with little fingers.



<P>-- No, don't, she cried.



<P>-- I won't listen, she cried.



<P>But Bloom?



<P>Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey's tone:



<P>-- For your what? says he.



<P>Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed

again:



<P>-- Don't let me think of him or I'll expire. The hideous old wretch!

That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.



<P>She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped sweet tea.



<P>-- Here he was, Miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters,

ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!



<P>Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from Miss Kennedy's throat. Miss Douce

huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a shout

in quest.



<P>-- O! shrieking, Miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget bis goggle

eye?



<P>Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:



<P>-- And your other eye!



<P>Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner's name. Why do I always think

Figather? Gathering figs I think. And Prosper Lor&eacute;'s huguenot name.

By Bassi's blessed virgins Bloom's dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white

under, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I

could not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus' son. He

might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of fellows

in: her white.



<P>By went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.



<P>Of sin.



<P>In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy

your other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let

freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each Other, high

piercing notes.



<P>Ah, panting, sighing. Sighing, ah, fordone their mirth died down.



<P>Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and giggle-giggled.

Miss Douce, bending again over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and

rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping her fair pinnacles

of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her

mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:



<P>-- O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that, she cried.

With his bit of beard!



<P>Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman,

delight, joy, indignation.



<P>-- Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.



<P>Shrill, with deep laughter, after bronze in gold, they urged each other

to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold goldbronze, shrilldeep,

to laughter after laughter: And then laughed more. Greasy I knows. Exhausted,

breathless their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed,

against the counterledge. All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all

breathless.



<P>Married to Bloom, to greaseaseabloom.



<P>-- O saints above! Miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I

wished I hadn't laughed so much. I feel all wet.



<P>-- O, Miss Douce! Miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!



<P>And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.



<P>By Cantwell's offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi's virgins, bright

of their oils. Nannetti's father hawked those things about, wheedling at

doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him about Keyes's par. Eat first. I

want. Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning.

On. Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five

guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets

of sin.



<P>Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.



<P>Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of

his rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.



<P>-- O welcome back, Miss Douce.



<P>He held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?.



<P>-- Tiptop.



<P>He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.



<P>-- Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the

strand all day.



<P>Bronze whiteness.



<P>-- That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed

her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.



<P>Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.



<P>-- O go away, she said. You're very simple, I don't think.



<P>He was.



<P>-- Well now, I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they christened

me simple Simon.



<P>-- You must have been a doaty, Miss Douce made answer. And what did

the doctor order today?



<P>-- Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I'll trouble

you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.



<P>Jingle.



<P>-- With the greatest alacrity, Miss Douce agreed.



<P>With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane's

she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from

her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch

and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.



<P>-- By Jove, he mused. I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must

be a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at

last, they say. Yes, yes.



<P>Yes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid's, into

the bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.



<P>None not said nothing. Yes.



<P>Gaily Miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:



<P>-- <I>O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas</I>!



<P>-- Was Mr Lidwell in today?



<P>In came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge.

Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write. Buy paper.

Daly's. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue Bloom is on the rye.



<P>-- He was in at lunchtime, Miss Douce said.



<P>Lenehan came forward.



<P>-- Was Mr Boylan looking for me?



<P>He asked. She answered:



<P>-- Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?



<P>She asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her

gaze upon a page.



<P>-- No. He was not.



<P>Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard not seen, read on. Lenehan round the sandwichbell

wound his round body round.



<P>-- Peep! Who's in the corner?



<P>No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her

stops. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.



<P>Jingle jaunty jingle.



<P>Girlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no notice

while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:



<P>-- Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your

bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?



<P>He droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.



<P>He sighed, aside:



<P>-- Ah me! O my!



<P>He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.



<P>-- Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.



<P>-- Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.



<P>Lenehan opened most genial arms. Who?



<P>-- Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.



<P>Dry.



<P>Mr Dedalus, famous fighter, laid by his dry filled pipe.



<P>-- I see, he said. I didn't recognize him for the moment. I hear he

is keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?



<P>He had.



<P>-- I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In

Mooney's <I>en ville</I> and in Mooney's <I>sur mer</I>. He had received

the rhino for the labour of his muse.



<P>He smiled at bronze's teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes.



<P>-- The <I>&eacute;lite</I> of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous

pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin's most brilliant scribe and editor, and that

minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation

of the O'Madden Burke.



<P>After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and



<P>-- That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.



<P>He see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his glass.



<P>He looked towards the saloon door.



<P>-- I see you have moved the piano.



<P>-- The tuner was in today, Miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking

concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.



<P>-- Is that a fact?



<P>-- Didn't he, Miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind

too, poor fellow. Not twenty I'm sure he was.



<P>-- Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.



<P>He drank and strayed away.



<P>-- So sad to look at his face, Miss Douce condoled.



<P>God's curse on bitch's bastard.



<P>Tink to her pity cried a diner's bell. To the door of the diningroom

came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond. Lager for

diner. Lager without alacrity she served.



<P>With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jingle

jaunty blazes boy.



<P>Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique

triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her

hand), soft pedalling a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing,

to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.



<P>Two sheets cream vellum paper on reserve two envelopes when I was in

Wisdom Hely's wise Bloom in Daly's Henry Flower bought. Are you not happy

in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means something,

language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is. Respectable girl meet

after mass. Tanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster,

a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff

of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For some man. For Raoul. He eyed and

saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jauntingcar. It is. Third

time. Coincidence.



<P>Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.

Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.



<P>-- Two pence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.



<P>Aha... I was forgetting... Excuse...



<P>And four.



<P>At four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go. Ternoon.

Think you're the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all. For men.



<P>In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.



<P>From the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the

tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. Acall again. That he now poised

that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier,

its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.



<P>Pat paid for diner's popcorked bottle: and over tumbler tray and popcorked

bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with Miss Douce.



<P>-- <I>The bright stars fade</I>...



<P>A voiceless song sang from within, singing:



<P>-- ... <I>the morn is breaking</I>.



<P>A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive

hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called

to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love's leavetaking,

life's, love's morn.



<P>-- <I>The dewdrops pearl</I>...



<P>Lenehan's lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.



<P>-- But look this way, he said, rose of Castille.



<P>Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.



<P>She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castille. Fretted forlorn,

dreamily rose.



<P>-- Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.



<P>She answered, slighting:



<P>-- Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies.



<P>Like lady, ladylike.



<P>Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.

Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and knew and hailed

him:



<P>-- See the conquering hero comes.



<P>Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered

hero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat walked

towards Richie Goulding's legal bag, lifted aloft saluting.



<P>-- <I>And I from thee</I>...



<P>-- I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.



<P>He touched to fair Miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled

on him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair,

a bosom and a rose.



<P>Boylan bespoke potions.



<P>-- What's your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a

sloegin for me. Wire in yet?



<P>Not yet. At four he. All said four.



<P>Cowley's red lugs and Adam's apple in the door of the sheriff's office.

Avoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting.

Wait.



<P>Hello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What,

Ormond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there.

See, not be seen. I think I'll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom

followed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.



<P>Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm,

her bust, that all but burst, so high.



<P>-- O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!



<P>But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.



<P>-- Why don't you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.



<P>Shebronze, dealing from her jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked

as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her

voice:



<P>-- Fine goods in small parcels.



<P>That is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.



<P>-- Here's fortune, Blazes said.



<P>He pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.



<P>-- Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...



<P>-- Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.



<P>-- Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.



<P>-- I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own,

you know. Fancy of a friend of mine.



<P>Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at Miss Douce's

lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.

Idolores. The eastern seas.



<P>Clock whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave),

bearing away teatray. Clock clacked.



<P>Miss Douce took Boylan's coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It clanged.

Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed

and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For me.



<P>-- What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?



<P>O'clock.



<P>Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes

Boylan's elbowsleeve.



<P>-- Let's hear the time, he said.



<P>The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.

Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the

door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come: whet

appetite. I couldn't do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.



<P>Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure's skyblue bow and eyes.



<P>-- Go on, pressed Lenehan. There's no-one. He never heard.



<P>-- ... <I>to Flora's lips did hie</I>.



<P>High, a high note, pealed in the treble, clear.



<P>Bronzedouce, communing with her rose that sank and rose, sought Blazes

Boylan's flower and eyes.



<P>-- Please, please.



<P>He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.



<P>-- <I>I could not leave thee</I>...



<P>-- Afterwits, Miss Douce promised coyly.



<P>-- No, now, urged Lenehan. <I>Sonnezlacloche!</I> O do! There's no-one.



<P>She looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling

faces watched her bend.



<P>Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord,

and lost and found it faltering.



<P>-- Go on! Do! <I>Sonnez</I>!



<P>Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted

them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.



<P>-- <I>Sonnez</I>!



<P>Smack. She let free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm

against her smackable woman's warmhosed thigh.



<P>-- <I>La cloche!</I> cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust

there.



<P>She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren't men?), but, lightward gliding,

mild she smiled on Boylan.



<P>-- You're the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.



<P>Boyland, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drankoff his tiny

chalice, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. He spellbound eyes went

after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch

for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where

it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.



<P>Yes, bronze from anearby.



<P>-- ... <I>Sweetheart, goodbye!</I>



<P>-- I'm off, said Boylan with impatience.



<P>He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.



<P>-- Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell

you. Tom Rochford...



<P>-- Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.



<P>Lenehan gulped to go.



<P>-- Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I'm coming.



<P>He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold,

saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.



<P>-- How do you do Mr Dollard?



<P>-- Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard's vague bass answered, turning an

instant from Father Cowley's woe. He won't give you any trouble, Bob. All

Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We'll put a barleystraw in that Judas

Iscariot's ear this time.



<P>Sighing, Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.



<P>-- Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon, give us

a ditty. We heard the piano.



<P>Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders, Power for Richie.

And Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How

warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me

see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.



<P>-- What's that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.



<P>-- Come on, come on, Ben Dollar called. Begone, dull care. Come, Bob.



<P>He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the:

hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His

gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped stopped abrupt.



<P>Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered he wanted

Power and cider. Bronze by the window watched, bronze from afar.



<P>Jingle a tinkle jaunted.



<P>Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. He's off. Light sob of breath Bloom

sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He's gone. Jingle. Hear.



<P>-- Love and war, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.



<P>Miss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten

by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she

lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive (why did

he go so quick when I?) about her bronze over the bar where bald stood

by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite,

slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, <I>eau de Nil</I>.



<P>-- Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded

them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the

Collard grand.



<P>There was.



<P>-- A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn't stop

him. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.



<P>-- God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished

keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.



<P>They laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding

garment.



<P>-- Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where's

my pipe by the way?



<P>He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried

two diners' drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.



<P>-- I saved the situation, Ben, I think.



<P>-- You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too.

That was a brilliant idea, Bob.



<P>Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the situa.

Tight trou. Brilliant ide.



<P>-- I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano

in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and

who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you

remember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap

in Keogh's gave us the number. Remember?



<P>Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.



<P>-- By God she had some luxurious opera cloaks and things there.



<P>Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.



<P>-- Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He

wouldn't take any money either. What? Any God's quantity of cocked hats

and boleros and trunkhose. What?



<P>-- Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes

of all descriptions.



<P>Jingle haunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.



<P>Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.



<P>Mrs Marion met him pike hoses. Smell of burn of Paul de Kock. Nice name

he.



<P>-- What's this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion.



<P>-- Tweedy.



<P>-- Yes. Is she alive?



<P>-- And kicking.



<P>-- She was a daughter of...



<P>-- Daughter of the regiment.



<P>-- Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.



<P>Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after.



<P>-- Irish? I don't know, faith. Is she, Simon?



<P>Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.



<P>-- Buccinator muscle is... What?... Bit rusty... O, she is... My Irish

Molly, O.



<P>He puffed a pungent plumy blast.



<P>-- From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.



<P>They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by

maraschino, thoughtful all two, Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra

with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.



<P>Pat served uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before

he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods' roes while

Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney,

bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.



<P>Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.



<P>By Bachelor's walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun,

in heat, mare's glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres:

sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you the?

Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.



<P>Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding

chords:



<P>-- <I>When love absorbs my ardent soul</I>...



<P>Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roof-panes.



<P>-- War! War! cried Father Cowley. You're the warrior.



<P>-- So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love

or money.



<P>He stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.



<P>-- Sure, you'd burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through

smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.



<P>In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.



<P>-- Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time,

Ben. <I>Amoroso ma non troppo</I>. Let me there.



<P>Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She passed

a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather. They

drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going? And

heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn't say. But it would be in

the paper. O, she needn't trouble. No trouble. She waved about her outspread

<I>Independent</I>, searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair

slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble, first gentleman said. O, not

in the least. Way he looked that. Lord lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard

iron steel.



<P>-- ... <I>my ardent soul</I>



<P><I>I care not foror the morrow.</I>



<P>In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and war someone is.

Ben Dollard's famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for

that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers. Molly did

laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking.

With all his belongings on show. O, saints above, I'm drenched! O, the

women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many! Well, of course, that's

what gives him the base barreltone. For instance eunuchs. Wonder who's

playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical. Knows whatever note you play.

Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.



<P>Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George

Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist, a lady's,

hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the old dingdong

again.



<P>-- Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.



<P>George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.



<P>Bloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the

Burton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables,

flowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro, bald Pat. Nothing to do. Best

value in Dub.



<P>Piano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together,

mutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the bowend,

sawing the 'cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore. Night

we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between the

acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle. Conductor's legs too,

bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide them.



<P>Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.



<P>Only the harp. Lovely gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of

a lovely. Gravy's rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that

once or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their harps.

I. He. Old. Young.



<P>-- Ah, I couldn't, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.



<P>Strongly.



<P>-- Go on, blast you, Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits



<P>-- <I>M'appari</I>, Simon, Father Cowley said.



<P>Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long

arms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he

sang to a dusty seascape there: <I>A Last Farewell</I>. A headland, a ship,

a sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the

wind upon the headland, wind around her.



<P>Cowley sang:



<P>-- <I>M'appari tutt amor</I>;



<P><I>Il mio sguardo l'incontr</I>...



<P>She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil to one departing, dear one, to

wind, love, speeding sail, return.



<P>-- Go on, Simon.



<P>-- Ah, sure my dancing days are done, Ben... Well...



<P>Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting,

touched the obedient keys.



<P>-- No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original One flat.



<P>The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.



<P>Up stage strode Father Cowley.



<P>-- Here, Simon. I'll accompany you, he said. Get up.



<P>By Graham Lemon's pineapple rock, by Elvery's elephant jingle jogged.

Steak, kidney, liver, mashed at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom

and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank Power and cider.



<P>Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: <I>Sonnambula</I>.

He heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, that M'Guckin! Yes. In his way.

Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like.

Never forget it. Never.



<P>Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.

Backache he. Bright's bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the

piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile.

Sings too: <I>Down among the dead men</I>. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets

to the. Not-making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him.

Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water.

Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign in dribs

and drabs. And when he's wanted not a farthing. Screwed refusing to pay

his fare. Curious types.



<P>Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived, never. In

the gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.



<P>Speech paused on Richie's lips.



<P>Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all. Believes his

own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.



<P>-- Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.



<P>-- <I>All is lost now</I>...



<P>Richie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured

all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he's proud

of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two notes in one there.

Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my motives he twined and

turned them. All most too new call is lost in all. Echo. How sweet the

answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender,

lost.



<P>Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase.

Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence

in the moon. Still hold her back. Brave, don't know their danger. Call

name. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That's why.

Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.



<P>-- A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.



<P>Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.



<P>He knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise

child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?



<P>Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking

Richie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye.

Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir.

Wouldn't trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.



<P>Piano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably. Stopped

again.



<P>Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.



<P>-- With it, Simon.



<P>-- It, Simon.



<P>-- Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind solicitations.



<P>-- It, Simon.



<P>-- I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour

to sing to you of a heart bowed down.



<P>By the sandwichbell in screening shadow, Lydia her bronze and rose,

a lady's grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous <I>eau de Nil</I>

Mina to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.



<P>The harping chords of prelude closed. A chord longdrawn, expectant drew

a voice away.



<P>-- When first I saw that form endearing.



<P>Richie turned.



<P>-- Si Dedalus' voice, he said.



<P>Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow

endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to

Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the

bar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited, waiting

to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.



<P>-- <I>Sorrow from me seemed to depart</I>.



<P>Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves

in murmur, like no voice of strings of reeds or what doyoucallthem dulcimers,

touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered

lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart

when first they heard. When first they saw, lost Richie, Poldy, mercy of

beauty, heard from a person wouldn't expect it in the least, her first

merciful lovesoft oftloved word.



<P>Love that is singing: love's old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the

elastic band of his packet. Love's old sweet <I>sonnez la</I> gold. Bloom

wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound

it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.



<P>-- <I>Full of hope and all delighted</I>...



<P>Tenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at

his feet when will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He

can't sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him.

What perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last look

at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How do you?

I do well. There? What? Or? Phila of cachous, kissing comfits, in her satchel.

Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.



<P>Alas! The voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.



<P>-- <I>But alas, 'twas idle dreaming</I>...



<P>Glorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly

man! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out his

wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he doesn't

break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing too. Drink.

Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind soup: stock,

sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.



<P>Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling. Full it throbbed. That's the chat.

Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.



<P>Words? Music? No: it's what's behind.



<P>Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.



<P>Bloom. Flood of warm jimjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music

out, in desire, dark to lick flow, invading. Tipping her tepping her tapping

her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The joy the feel the

warm the. Tup. To pour o'er sluices pouring gushes. Flood, gush, flow,

joygush, tupthrop. Now! Language of love.



<P>-- ... <I>ray of hope</I>...



<P>Beaming. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse

unsqueaked a ray of hope.



<P><I>Martha</I> it is. Coincidence. Just going to write. Lionel's song.

Lovely name you have. Can't write. Accept my little pres. Play on her heartstrings

pursestrings too. She's a. I called you naughty boy. Still the name: Martha.

How strange! Today.



<P>The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to

Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting, to

wait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part,

how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom's heart.



<P>Wish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in

Drago's always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still

hear it better here than in the bar though farther.



<P>-- <I>Each graceful look</I>...



<P>First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon's in Terenure. Yellow,

black lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her.

Fate. Round and round slow. Quick round. We two. All looked. Halt. Down

she sat. All ousted looked. Lips laughing. Yellow knees.



<P>-- <I>Charmed my eye</I>...



<P>Singing. <I>Waiting</I> she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of

perfume of what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat

warbling. First I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy eyes.

Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in shadow

Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.



<P>-- <I>Martha! Ah, Martha!</I>



<P>Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant

to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In

cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must Martha feel. For only

her he waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where. Somewhere.



<P>-- <I>Co-me, thou lost one!</I>



<P><I>Co-me thou dear one!</I>



<P>Alone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, chest note, return.



<P>-- <I>Come!</I>



<P>It soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver

orb it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don't spin it out too

long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent, aflame,

crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the ethereal bosom,

high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere all soaring all around about

the all, the endlessnessnessness...



<P>-- <I>To me!</I>



<P>Siopold!



<P>Consumed.



<P>Come. Well sung. All clapped. She ought to. Come. To me, to him, to

her, you too, me, us.



<P>-- Bravo! Clapclap. Goodman, Simon. Clappyclapclap. Encore! Clapclipclap.

Sound as a bell. Bravo, Simon! Clapclopclap. Encore, enclap, said, cried,

clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Douce, George Lidwell, Pat, Mina, two gentlemen

with two tankards, Cowley, first gent with tank and bronze Miss Douce and

gold Miss Mina.



<P>Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before.

Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson, reverend

father Theobald Matthew, jaunted as said before just now. Atrot, in heat,

heatseated. <I>Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la</I>. Slower the mare

went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too slow for Boylan, blazes

Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.



<P>An afterclang of Cowley's chords closed, died on the air made richer.



<P>And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank,

Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two tankards

if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving, coral lips, at first,

at second. She did not mind.



<P>-- Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you'd

sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.



<P>Lionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina Kennedy

served. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in; Lydia, admired,

admired. But Bloom sang dumb.



<P>Admiring.



<P>Richie, admiring, descanted on that man's glorious voice. He remembered

one night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang '<I>Twas rank and

fame</I>: in Ned Lambert's 'twas. Good God he never heard in all his life

a note like that he never did <I>then false one we had better part</I>

so clear so God he never heard <I>since love lives not</I> a clinking voice

ask Lambert he can tell you too.



<P>Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the

night, Si in Ned Lambert's, Dedalus' house, sang '<I>Twas rank and fame</I>...



<P>He, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom

of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing '<I>Twas rank and

fame</I> in his, Ned Lambert's house.



<P>Brothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the

lute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more.

The nights Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky cords. Wonderful, more

than all the others.



<P>That voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It's in the silence you feel

you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.



<P>Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked

the slender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzzed, it twanged. While

Goulding talked of Barraclough's voice production, while Tom Kernan, harking

back in a retrospective sort of arrangement, talked to listening Father

Cowley who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While big Ben Dollard

talked with Simon Dedalus lighting, who nodded as he smoked, who smoked.



<P>Thou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his

string. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them on.

Then tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head. Outtohelloutofthat.

Human life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat's tail wriggling! Five bob I gave. <I>Corpus

paradisum</I>. Corncrake croaker: belly like a poisoned pup. Gone. They

sing. Forgotten. I too. And one day she with. Leave her: get tired. Suffer

then. Snivel. Big Spanishy eyes goggling at nothing. Her wavyavyeavyheavyeavyevyevy

hair un comb: 'd.



<P>Yet too much happy bores. He stretched more, more. Are you not happy

in your? Twang. It snapped.



<P>Jingle into Dorset street.



<P>Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.



<P>-- Don't make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.



<P>George Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.



<P>First gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him was that so. And

second tankard told her so. That that was so.



<P>Miss Douce, Miss Lydia, did not believe: Miss Kennedy, Mina, did not

believe: George Lidwell, no: Miss Dou did not: the first, the first: gent

with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, Miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell: the tank.



<P>Better write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted.



<P>Bald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad. He went.

A pad to blot. He heard, deaf Pat.



<P>-- Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut fine. It certainly

is. Few lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music is. Who

is this wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper,

envelope: unconcerned. It's so characteristic.



<P>-- Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.



<P>-- It is, Bloom said.



<P>Numbers it is. All music when you come to think. Two multiplied by two

divided by half is twice one. Vibrations: chords those are. One plus two

plus six is seven. Do anything you like with figures juggling. Always find

out this equal to that, symmetry under a cemetery wall. He doesn't see

my mourning. Callous: all for his own gut. Musemathematics. And you think

you're listening to the ethereal. But suppose you said it like: Martha,

seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall quite flat. It's

on account of the sounds it is.



<P>Instance he's playing now. Improvising. Might be what you like till

you hear the words. Want to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right: then hear

chords a bit off: feel lost a bit. In and out of sacks over barrels, through

wirefences, obstacle race. Time makes the tune. Question of mood you're

in. Still always nice to hear. Except scales up and down, girls learning.

Two together nextdoor neighbours. Ought to invent dummy pianos for that.

<I>Blumenlied</I> I bought for her. The name. Playing it slow, a girl,

night I came home, the girl. Door of the stables near Cecilia street. Milly

no taste. Queer because we both I mean.



<P>Bald deaf Pat brought quite flat pad ink. Pat set with ink pen quite

flat pad. Pat took plate dish knife fork. Pat went.



<P>It was the only language Mr Dedalus said to Ben. He heard them as a

boy in Ringabella, Crosshaven, Ringabella, singing their barcaroles. Queenstown

harbour full of Italian ships. Walking, you know, Ben, in the moonlight

with those earthquake hats. Blending their voices. God, such music, Ben.

Heard as a boy. Cross Ringabella haven mooncarole.



<P>Sour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed

a moonlight nightcall, clear from anear, a call from afar, replying.



<P>Down the edge of his <I>Freeman</I> baton ranged Bloom's your other

eye, scanning for where did I see that. Callan, Coleman, Dignam Patrick.

Heigho! Heigho! Fawcett. Aha! Just I was looking...



<P>Hope he's not looking, cute as a rat. He held unfurled his <I>Freeman</I>.

Can't see now. Remember write Greek ees. Bloom dipped, Bloo mur: dear sir.

Dear Henry wrote: dear Mady. Got your lett and flow. Hell did I put? Some

pock or oth. It is utterl imposs. Underline <I>imposs</I>. To write today.



<P>Bore this. Bored Bloom tambourined gently with I am just reflecting

fingers on flat pad Pat brought.



<P>On. Know what I mean. No, change that ee. Accept my poor little pres

enclos. Ask her no answ. Hold on. Five Dig. Two about here. Penny the gulls.

Elijah is com. Seven Davy Byrne's. Is eight about. Say half a crown. My

poor little pres: p. o. two and six. Write me a long. Do you despise? Jingle,

have you the? So excited. Why do you call me naught? You naughty too? O,

Mairy lost the pin of her. Bye for today. Yes, yes, will tell you. Want

to. To keep it up. Call me that other. Other world she wrote. My patience

are exhaust. To keep it up. You must believe. Believe. The tank. It. Is.

True.



<P>Folly am I writing? Husbands don't. That's marriage does, their wives.

Because I'm away from. Suppose. But how? She must. Keep young. If she found

out. Card in my high grade ha. No, not tell all. Useless pain. If they

don't see. Woman. Sauce for the gander.



<P>A hackney car, number three hundred and twentyfour, driver Barton James

of number one Harmony avenue, Donnybrook, on which sat a fare, a young

gentleman, stylishly dressed in an indigoblue serge suit made by George

Robert Mesias, tailor and cutter, of number five Eden quay, and wearing

a straw hat very dressy, bought of John Plasto of number one Great Brunswick

street, hatter. Eh? This is the jingle that joggled and jingled. By Dlugacz'

porkshop bright tubes of Agendath trotted a gallantbuttocked mare.



<P>-- Answering an ad? keen Richie's eyes asked Bloom.



<P>-- Yes, Mr Bloom said. Town traveller. Nothing doing, I expect.



<P>Bloom mur: best references. But Henry wrote: it will excite me. You

know now. In haste. Henry. Greek ee. Better add postscript. What is he

playing now? Improvising intermezzo. P. S. The rum tum tum. How will you

pun? You punish me? Crooked skirt swinging, whack by. Tell me I want to.

Know. O. Course if I didn't I wouldn't ask. La la la ree. Trails off there

sad in minor. Why minor sad? Sign H. They like sad tail at end. P. P. S.

La la la ree. I feel so sad today. La ree. So lonely. Dee.

Murmured: Messrs Callan, Coleman and Co, limited. Henry wrote:

by the throat. <I>Scoundrel</I>, said he. You'll <I>sing no more lovesongs</I>.

He did, sir Tom. Bob Cowley wove. Tenors get wom. Cowley lay back.



<P>Ah, now he heard, she holding it to his ear. Hear! He heard. Wonderful.

She held it to her own and through the sifted light pale gold in contrast

glided. To hear.



<P>Tap.



<P>Bloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He heard more

faintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for other,

hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.



<P>Bronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened.



<P>Her ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Been to the seaside.

Lovely seaside girls. Skin tanned raw. Should have put on coldcream first

make it brown. Buttered toast. O and that lotion mustn't forget. Fever

near her mouth. Your head it simply. Hair braided over: shell with seaweed.

Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair? And Turks their mouth, why?

Her eyes over the sheet, a yashmak. Find the way in. A cave. No admittance

except on business.



<P>The sea they think they hear. Singing. A roar. The blood is it. Souse

in the ear sometimes. Well, it's a sea. Corpuscle islands.



<P>Wonderful really. So distinct. Again. George Lidwell held its murmur,

hearing: then laid it by, gently.



<P>-- What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiled.



<P>Charming, seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.



<P>Tap.



<P>By Larry O'Rourke's, by Larry, bold Larry O', Boylan swayed and Boylan

turned.



<P>From the forsaken shell Miss Mina glided to her tankard waiting. No,

she was not so lonely archly Miss Douce's head let Mr Lidwell know. Walks

in the moonlight by the sea. No, not alone. With whom? She nobly answered:

with a gentleman friend.



<P>Bob Cowley's twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord

has the prior. A little time. Long John. Big Ben Lightly he played a light

bright tinkling measure for tripping ladies, arch and smiling, and for

their gallants, gentlemen friends. One: one, one, one: two, one, three,

four.



<P>Sea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows lowing, the cattle market,

cocks, hens don't crow, snakes hissss. There's music everywhere. Ruttledge's

door: ee creaking. No, that's noise. Minuet of <I>Don Giovanni</I> he's

playing now. Court dresses of all descriptions in castle chambers dancing.

Misery. Peasants outside. Green starving faces eating dockleaves. Nice

that is. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look at us.



<P>That's joyful I can feel. Never have written it. Why? My joy is other

joy. But both are joys. Yes, joy it must be. Mere fact of music shows you

are. Often thought she was in the dumps till she began to lilt. Then know.



<P>M'Coy valise. My wife and your wife. Squealing eat. Like tearing silk.

When she talks like the clapper of a bellows. They can't manage men's intervals.

Gap in their voices too. Fill me. I'm warm, dark, open. Molly in <I>qui

est homo</I>: Mercadante. My ear against the wall to hear. Want a woman

who can deliver the goods.



<P>Jog jig jogged stopped. Dandy tan shoe of dandy Boy Ian socks skyblue

clocks came light to earth.



<P>O, look we are so! Chamber music. Could make a kind of pun on that.

It is a kind of music I often thought when she. Acoustics that is. Tinkling.

Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the resonance changes

according as the weight of the water is equal to the law of falling water.

Like those rhapsodies of Liszt's, Hungarian, gipsyeyed. Pearls. Drops.

Rain. Diddle iddle addle addle oodle oodle. Hiss. Now. Maybe now. Before.



<P>One rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock Paul de

Kock, with a loud proud knocker, with a cock carracarracarra cock. Cockcock.



<P>Tap.



<P>-- <I>Qui sdegno</I>, Ben, said Father Cowley.



<P>-- No, Ben, Tom Kernan interfered, <I>The Croppy Boy</I>. Our native

Doric.



<P>-- Ay do, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. Good men and true.



<P>-- Do, do, they begged in one.



<P>I'll go. Here, Pat, return. Come. He came, he came, he did not stay.

To me. How much?



<P>-- What key? Six sharps?



<P>-- F sharp major, Ben Dollard said.



<P>Bob Cowley's outstretched talons gripped the black deep sounding chords.



<P>Must go prince Bloom told Richie prince. No, Richie said. Yes, must.

Got money somewhere. He's on for a razzle backache spree. Much? He seehears

lipspeech. One and nine. Penny for yourself. Here. Give him twopence tip.

Deaf, bothered. But perhaps he has wife and family waiting, waiting Patty

come home. Hee hee hee hee. Deaf wait while they wait.



<P>But wait. But hear. Chords dark. Lugugugubrious. Low. In a cave of the

dark middle earth. Embedded ore. Lumpmusic.



<P>The voice of dark age, of unlove, earth's fatigue made grave approach,

and painful, come from afar, from hoary mountains, called on good men and

true. The priest he sought, with him would he speak a word.



<P>Tap.



<P>Ben Dollard's voice barreltone. Doing his level best to say it. Croak

of vast manless moonless womoonless marsh. Other comedown. Big ships' chandler's

business he did once. Remember: rosiny ropes, ships' lanterns. Failed to

the tune of ten thousand pounds. Now in the Iveagh home. Cubicle number

so and so. Number one Bass did that for him.



<P>The priest's at home. A false priest's servant bade him welcome. Step

in. The holy father. Curlycues of chords.



<P>Ruin them. Wreck their lives. Then build them cubicles to end their

days in. Hushaby. Lullaby. Die, dog. Little dog, die.



<P>The voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered

a lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footstep there, told them

the gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive.



<P>Decent soul. Bit addled now. Thinks he'll win in <I>Answers</I> poets'

picture puzzle. We hand you crisp five pound note. Bird sitting hatching

in a nest. Lay of the last minstrel he thought it was. See blank tee what

domestic animal? Tee dash ar most courageous mariner. Good voice he has

still. No eunuch yet with all his belongings.



<P>Listen. Bloom listened. Richie Goulding listened. And by the door deaf

Pat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened.



<P>The chords harped slower.



<P>The voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous.

Ben's contrite beard confessed: <I>in nomine Domini</I>, in God's name.

He knelt. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: <I>mea culpa</I>.



<P>Latin again. That holds them like birdlime. Priest with the communion

corpus for those women. Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey, <I>corpusnomine</I>.

Wonder where that rat is by now. Scrape.



<P>Tap.



<P>They listened: tankards and Miss Kennedy, George Lidwell eyelid well

expressive, fullbusted satin, Kernan, Si.



<P>The sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since easter he had cursed

three 'times. You bitch's bast. And once at masstime he had gone to play.

Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother's rest he had not

prayed. A boy. A croppy boy.



<P>Bronze, listening by the beerpull, gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn't

half know I'm. Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking.



<P>Bronze gazed far sideways. Mirror there. Is that best side of her face?

They always know. Knock at the door. Last tip to titivate.



<P>Cockcarracarra.



<P>What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes.

Night Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that

best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too. Custom

his country perhaps. That's music too. Not as bad as it sounds. Tootling.

Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Doublebasses, helpless, gashes

in their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Semigrand open crocodile music hath

jaws. Woodwind like Goodwin's name.



<P>She looked fine. Her crocus dress she wore, lowcut, belongings on show.

Clove her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question.

Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa's. Hypnotised, listening.

Eyes like that. She bent. Chap in dresscircle, staring down into her with

his operaglass for all he was worth. Beauty of music you must hear twice.

Nature woman half a look. God made the country man the tune. Met him pike

hoses. Philosophy. O rocks!



<P>All gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all

his brothers fell. To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would. Last

of his name and race.



<P>I too, last my race. Milly young student. Well, my fault perhaps. No

son. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?



<P>He bore no hate.



<P>Hate. Love. Those are names. Rudy. Soon I am old.



<P>Big Ben his voice unfolded. Great voice, Richie Goulding said, a flush

struggling in his pale, to Bloom, soon old but when was young.



<P>Ireland comes now. My country above the King. She listens. Who fears

to speak of nineteen four? Time to be shoving. Looked enough.



<P>-- <I>Bless me, father</I>, Dollard the croppy cried. <I>Bless me and

let me go</I>.



<P>Tap.



<P>Bloom looked, unblessed to go. Got up to kill: on eighteen bob a week.

Fellows shell out the dibs. Want to keep your weathereye open. Those girls,

those lovely. By the sad sea waves. Chorusgirl's romance. Letters read

out for breach of promise. From Chickabiddy's own Mumpsypum. Laughter in

court. Henry. I never signed it. The lovely name you.



<P>Low sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest rustling

soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all by heart.

The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.



<P>Tap. Tap.



<P>Thrilled, she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.



<P>Blank face. Virgin should say: or fingered only. Write something on

it: page. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. Keeps them young.

Even admire themselves. See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white woman,

a flute alive. Blow gentle. Loud. Three holes all women. Goddess I didn't

see. They want it: not too much polite. That's why he gets them. Gold in

your pocket, brass in your face. With look to look: songs without words.

Molly that hurdygurdy boy. She knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because

so like the Spanish. Understand animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift

of nature.



<P>Ventriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?



<P>Will? You? I. Want. You. To.



<P>With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed. Swelling in apoplectic bitch's

bastard. A good thought, boy, to come. One hour's your time to live, your

last.



<P>Tap. Tap.



<P>Thrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear for martyrs. For all

things dying, want to, dying to, die. For that all things born. Poor Mrs

Purefoy. Hope she's over. Because their wombs.



<P>A liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly,

hearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On yonder river.

At each slow satiny heaving bosom's wave (her heaving embon) red rose rose

slowly, sank red rose. Heartbeats her breath: breath that is life. And

all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.



<P>But look. The bright stars fade. O rose! Castille. The morn. Ha. Lidwell.

For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See her from here though.

Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.



<P>On the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand lightly, plumply, leave

it to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over the

polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and finger

passed in pity: passed, repassed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly,

slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding

ring.



<P>With a cock with a carra.



<P>Tap. Tap. Tap.



<P>I hold this house. Amen. He gnashed in fury. Traitors swing.



<P>The chords consented. Very sad thing. But had to be.



<P>Get out before the end. Thanks, that was heavenly. Where's my hat. Pass

by her. Can leave that <I>Freeman</I>. Letter I have. Suppose she were

the? No. Walk, walk, walk. Like Cashel Boylo Connoro Coylo Tisdall Maurice

Tisntdall Farrell, Waaaaaaalk.



<P>Well, I must be. Are you off? Yrfmstbyes. Blmstup. O'er ryehigh blue.

Bloom stood up. Ow. Soap feeling rather sticky behind. Must have sweated:

music. That lotion, remember. Well, so long. High grade. Card inside, yes.



<P>By deaf Pat in the doorway, straining ear, Bloom passed.



<P>At Geneva barrack that young man died. At Passage was his body laid.

Dolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to dolorous

prayer.



<P>By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties,

by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and

faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom.



<P>Tap. Tap. Tap.



<P>Pray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard. You who hear in peace. Breathe

a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people. He was the croppy boy.



<P>Scaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway

heard growls and roars of bravo, fat back-slapping, their boots all treading,

boots not the boots the boy. General chorus off for a swill to wash it

down. Glad I avoided.



<P>-- Come on, Ben, Simon Dedalus said. By God, you're as good as ever

you were.



<P>-- Better, said Tomgin Kernan. Most trenchant rendition of that ballad,

upon my soul and honour it is.



<P>-- Lablache, said Father Cowley.



<P>Ben Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed and

all big roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering castagnettes

in the air.



<P>Big Benaden Dollard. Big Benben. Big Benben.



<P>Rrr.



<P>And deepmoved all, Simon trumping compassion from foghorn nose, all

laughing, they brought him forth, Ben Dollard, in right good cheer.



<P>-- You're looking rubicund, George Lidwell said.



<P>Miss Douce composed her rose to wait.



<P>-- Ben machree, said Mr Dedalus, clapping Ben's fat back shoulderblade.

Fit as a fiddle, only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his

person.



<P>Rrrrrrsss.



<P>-- Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled.



<P>Richie rift in the lute alone sat: Goulding, Collis, Ward. Uncertainly

he waited. Unpaid Pat too.



<P>Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.



<P>Miss Mina Kennedy brought near her lips to ear of tankardone.



<P>-- Mr Dollard, they murmured low.



<P>-- Dollard, murmured tankard.



<P>Tank one believed: Miss Kenn when she: that doll he was: she doll: the

tank.



<P>He murmured that he knew the name. The name was familiar to him, that

is to say. That was to say he had heard the name of Dollard, was it? Dollard,

yes.



<P>Yes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely,

murmured Mina. And <I>The last rose of summer</I> was a lovely song. Mina

loved that song. Tankard loved the song that Mina.



<P>'Tis the last rose of summer Dollard left Bloom felt wind wound round

inside.



<P>Gassy thing that cider: binding too. Wait. Postoffice near Reuben J's

one and eightpence too. Get shut of it. Dodge round by Greek street. Wish

I hadn't promised to meet. Freer in air. Music. Gets on your nerves. Beerpull.

Her hand that rocks the cradle rules the. Ben Howth. That rules the world.



<P>Far. Far. Far. Far.



<P>Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.



<P>Up the quay went Lionelleopold, naughty Henry with letter for Mady,

with sweets of sin with frillies for Raoul with met him pike hoses went

Poldy on.



<P>Tap blind walked tapping by the tap the curbstone tapping, tap by tap.



<P>Cowley, he stunts himself with it; kind of drunkenness. Better give

way only half way the way of a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All

ears. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time. Dotty.

You daren't budge. Thinking strictly prohibited. Always talking shop. Fiddlefaddle

about notes.



<P>All a kind of attempt to talk. Unpleasant when it stops because you

never know exac. Organ in Gardiner street. Old Glynn fifty quid a year.

Queer up there in the cockloft alone with stops and locks and keys. Seated

all day at the organ. Maunder on for hours, talking to himself or the other

fellow blowing the bellows. Growl angry, then shriek cursing (want to have

wadding or something in his no don't she cried), then all of a soft sudden

wee little wee little pippy wind.



<P>Pwee! A wee little wind piped eeee. In Bloom's little wee.



<P>Was he? Mr Dedalus said, returning, with fetched pipe. I was with him

this morning at poor little Paddy Dignam's...



<P>-- Ay, the Lord have mercy on him.



<P>-- By the by there's a tuningfork in there on the...



<P>Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.



<P>-- The wife has a fine voice. Or had. What? Lidwell asked.



<P>-- O, that must be the tuner, Lydia said to Simonlionel first I saw,

forgot it when he was here.



<P>Blind he was she told George Lidwell second I saw. And played so exquisitely,

treat to hear. Exquisite contrast: bronzelid minagold.



<P>-- Shout! Ben Dollard shouted, pouring. Sing out!



<P>-- 'lldo! cried Father Cowley.



<P>Rrrrrr.



<P>I feel I want...



<P>Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.



<P>-- Very, Mr Dedalus said, staring hard at a headless sardine.



<P>Under the sandwichbell lay on a bier of bread one last, one lonely,

last sardine of summer. Bloom alone.



<P>-- Very, he stared. The lower register, for choice.



<P>Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.



<P>Bloom went by Barry's. Wish I could. Wait. That wonderworker if I had.

Twentyfour solicitors in that one house. Litigation. Love one another.

Piles of parchment. Messrs Pick and Pocket have power of attorney. Goulding,

Collis, Ward.



<P>But for example the chap that wallops the big drum. His vocation: Micky

Rooney's band. Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at home after pig's

cheek and cabbage nursing it in the armchair. Rehearsing his band part.

Pom. Pompedy. Jolly for the wife. Asses' skins. Welt them through life,

then wallop after death. Pom. Wallop. Seems to be what you call yashmak

or I mean kismet. Fate.



<P>Tap. Tap. A stripling, blind, with a tapping cane, came taptaptapping

by Daly's window where a mermaid, hair all streaming (but he couldn't see),

blew whiffs of a mermaid (blind couldn't), mermaid coolest whiff of all.



<P>Instruments. A blade of grass, shell of her hands, then blow. Even comb

and tissuepaper you can knock a tune out of. Molly in her shift in Lombard

street west, hair down. I suppose each kind of trade made its own, don't

you see? Hunter with a horn. Haw. Have you the? <I>Cloche. Sonnez la!</I>

Shepherd his pipe. Policeman a whistle. Locks and keys! Sweep! Four o'clock's

all's well! Sleep! All is lost now. Drum? Pompedy. Wait, I know. Towncrier,

bumbailiff. Long John. Waken the dead. Pom. Dignam. Poor little <I>nominedomine</I>.

Pom. It is music, I mean of course it's all pom pom pom very much what

they call <I>da capo</I>. Still you can hear. As we march we march along,

march along. Pom.



<P>I must really. Fff. Now if I did that at a banquet. Just a question

of custom shah of Persia. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear. All the same he

must have been a bit of a natural not to see it was a yeoman cap. Muffled

up. Wonder who was that chap at the grave in the brown mackin. O, the whore

of the lane!



<P>A frowsy whore with black straw sailor hat askew came glazily in the

day along the quay towards Mr Bloom. When first he saw that form endearing.

Yes, it is. I feel so lonely. Wet night in the lane. Horn. Who had the?

Heehaw. Shesaw. Off her beat here. What is she? Hope she. Psst! Any chance

of your wash. Knew Molly. Had me decked. Stout lady does be with you in

the brown costume. Put you off your stroke. That appointment we made. Knowing

we'd never, well hardly ever. Too dear too near to home sweet home. Sees

me, does she? Looks a fright in the day. Face like dip. Damn her! O, well,

she has to live like the rest. Look in here.



<P>In Lionel Marks's antique saleshop window haughty Henry Lionel Leopold

dear Henry Flower earnestly Mr Leopold Bloom envisaged candlestick melodeon

oozing maggoty blowbags. Bargain: six bob. Might learn to play. Cheap.

Let her pass. Course everything is dear if you don't want it. That's what

good salesman is. Make you buy what he wants to sell. Chap sold me the

Swedish razor he shaved me with. Wanted to charge me for the edge he gave

it. She's passing now. Six bob.



<P>Must be the cider or perhaps the burgund.



<P>Near bronze from anear near gold from afar they chinked their clinking

glasses all, brighteyed and gallant, before bronze Lydia's tempting last

rose of summer, rose of Castille. First Lid, De, Cow, Ker, Doll, a fifth:

Lidwell, Si Dedalus, Bob Cowley, Kernan and Big Ben Dollard.



<P>Tap. A youth entered a lonely Ormond hall.



<P>Bloom viewed a gallant pictured hero in Lionel Marks's window. Robert

Emmet's last words. Seven last words. Of Meyerbeer that is.



<P>-- True men like you men.



<P>-- Ay, ay, Ben.



<P>-- Will lift your glass with us.



<P>They lifted.



<P>Tschink. Tschunk.



<P>Tip. An unseeing stripling stood in the door. He saw not bronze. He

saw not gold. Nor Ben nor Bob nor Tom nor Si nor George nor tanks nor Richie

nor Pat. Hee hee hee hee. He did not see.



<P>Seabloom, greaseabloom viewed last words. Softly. <I>When my country

takes her place among</I>.



<P>Prrprr.



<P>Must be the bur.



<P>Fff. Oo. Rrpr.



<P><I>Nations of the earth</I>. No-one behind. She's passed. <I>Then and

not till then</I>. Tram. Kran, kran, kran. Good oppor. Coming. Krandlkrankran.

I'm sure it's the burgund. Yes. One, two. <I>Let my epitaph be</I>. Karaaaaaaa.

<I>Written. I have</I>.



<P>Pprrpffrrppfff.



<P><I>Done</I>.

for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure, Palmerston

park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend and Sandymount

Tower, Harold's Cross. The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company's timekeeper

bawled them off:



<P>-- Rathgar and Terenure!



<P>-- Come on, Sandymount Green!



<P>Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck

moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.



<P>-- Start, Palmerston park!

The Wearer of the Crown</H2></CENTER>

Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished.

Parked in North Prince's street His Majesty's vermilion mailcars, bearing

on their sides the royal initials, E. R., received loudly flung sacks of

letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured and paid, for local,

provincial, British and overseas delivery.

Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince's stores

and bumped them up on the brewery float. On the brewery float bumped dullthudding

barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince's stores.



<P>-- There it is Red Murray said. Alexander Keyes.



<P>-- Just cut it out, will you? Mr Bloom said, and I'll take it round

to the <I>Telegraph</I> office.



<P>The-door of Ruttledge's office creaked again. Davy Stephens, minute

in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out

with a roll of papers under his cape, a king's courier.



<P>Red Murray's long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper

in four clean strokes. Scissors and paste.



<P>-- I'll go through the printing works, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut

square.



<P>-- Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind

his ear, we can do him one.



<P>-- Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod. I'll rub that in. We.

William Brayden, Esquire, of Oaklands, Sandymount</H2></CENTER>

Red Murray touched Mr Bloom's arm with the shears and whispered:



<P>-- Brayden.



<P>Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as

a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the <I>Weekly Freeman

and National Press</I> and the <I>Freeman's Journal and National Press</I>.

Dullthudding Guinness's barrels. It passed stately up the staircase steered

by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face. The broadcloth back ascended

each step: back. All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalus

says. Welts of flesh behind on him. Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat,

neck.



<P>-- Don't you think his face is like Our Saviour? Red Murray whispered.



<P>The door of Ruttledge's office whispered: ee: cree. They always build

one door opposite another for the wind to. Way in. Way out.



<P>Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk Mary, Martha.

Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.



<P>-- Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.



<P>-- Yes, Red Murray agreed. But Mario was said to be the picture of Our

Saviour.



<P>Jesus Mario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs. Hand on his

heart. In <I>Martha</I>.

<P>They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish. Neck.



<P>A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and

stepped off posthaste with a word.



<P>-- <I>Freeman!</I>



<P>Mr Bloom said slowly:



<P>-- Well, he is one of our saviours also.



<P>A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed

in through the sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along

the now reverberating boards. But will he save the circulation? Thumping,

thumping.



<P>He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing

paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti's

reading closet.

Hynes here too: account of the funeral probably. Thumping thump. This morning

the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines. Smash a man to atoms

away. And that old grey rat tearing to get in.

How a Great Daily Organ is turned out</H2></CENTER>

Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman's spare body, admiring a glossy crown.



<P>Strange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Member for

College green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was worth.

It's the ads ad side features sell a weekly not the stale news in the official

gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in the year one thousand

and. Demesne situate in the townland of Rosenallis, barony of Tinnachinch.

To all whom it may concern schedule pursuant to statute showing return

of number of mules and jennets exported from Ballina. Nature notes. Cartoons.

Phil Blake's weekly Pat and Bull story. Uncle' Toby's page for tiny tots.

Country bumpkin's queries. Dear Mr Editor, what is a good cure for flatulence?

I'd like that part. Learn a lot teaching others. The personal note M.A.

P. Mainly all pictures. Shapely bathers on golden strand. World's biggest

balloon. Double marriage of sisters celebrated. Two bridegrooms laughing

heartily at each other. Cuprani too, printer. More Irish than the Irish.



<P>The machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thurap. Now if

he got paralysed there and no one knew how to stop them they'd clank on

and on the same, print it over and over and up and back. Monkeydoodle the

whole thing. Want a cool head.



<P>-- Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.



<P>Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him they say.



<P>The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet

and made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently over the

dirty glass screen.



<P>-- Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.



<P>Mr Bloom stood in his way.



<P>-- If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,

pointing backward with his thumb.



<P>-- Did you? Hynes asked.



<P>-- Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and you'll catch him.



<P>-- Thanks, old man, Hynes said. I'll tap him too.



<P>He hurried on eagerly towards the <I>Freeman's Journal</I>.



<P>Three bob I lent him in Meagher's. Three weeks. Third hint.

<CENTER>

<H2>

We see the Canvasser at work</H2></CENTER>

Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti's desk.



<P>-- Excuse me, councillor, he said. This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember.



<P>Mr Nannetti considered the cutting a while and nodded.



<P>-- He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.



<P>He doesn't hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves.



<P>The foreman moved his pencil towards it.



<P>-- But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He

wants two keys at the top.



<P>Hell of a racket they make. Maybe he understands what I.



<P>The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began

to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.



<P>-- Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.



<P>Let him take that in first.



<P>Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman's

sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient

reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles of it unreeled.

What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand

and one things.



<P>Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly

on the scarred-woodwork.

<CENTER>

<H2>

House of Key(e)s</H2></CENTER>

-- Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name

Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.



<P>Better not teach him his own business.



<P>-- You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the

top in leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that's a good idea?



<P>The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched

there quietly.



<P>-- The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor,

the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from the

isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?



<P>I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <I>voglio</I>. But

then if he didn't know only make it awkward for him. Better not.



<P>-- We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?



<P>-- I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a

house there too. I'll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that and

just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. High class licensed

premises. Longfelt want. So on.



<P>The foreman thought for an instant.



<P>-- We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months' renewal.



<P>A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it silently.

Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent

typesetters at their cases.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Orthographical</H2></CENTER>

Want to be sure of his spelling. Proof fever. Martin Cunningham forgot

to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning. It is amusing to view

the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it? double ess ment of a harassed

pedlar while gauging au the symmetry of a peeled pear under a cemetery

wall. Silly, isn't it? Cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry.



<P>I could have said when he clapped on his topper. Thank you. I ought

to have said something about an old hat or something. No, I could have

said. Looks as good as new now. See his phizthen.



<P>Sllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forwards its flyboard

with slit the first batch of quirefolded papers. Sllt. Almost human the

way it sllt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak. That door

too slit creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in its own way.

Sllt.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Noted Churchman an Occasional Contributor</H2></CENTER>

The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:



<P>-- Wait. Where's the archbishop's letter? It's to be repeated in the

<I>Telegraph</I>. Where's what's his name?



<P>He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.



<P>-- Monks, sir? a voice asked from the castingbox.



<P>-- Ay. Where's Monks?



<P>-- Monks!



<P>Mr Bloom took up his cutting. Time to get out.



<P>-- Then I'll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you'll give it

a good place I know.



<P>-- Monks!



<P>-- Yes, sir.



<P>Three months' renewal. Want to get some wind off my chest first. Try

it anyhow. Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month. Ballsbridge. Tourists

over for the show.

<CENTER>

<H2>

A Dayfather</H2></CENTER>

He walked on through the caseroom, passing an old man, bowed, spectacled,

aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he must have put

through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs' ads, speeches, divorce

suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now. Sober serious

man with a bit in the savings-bank I'd say. Wife a good cook and washer.

Daughter working the machine in the parlour. Plain Jane, no damn nonsense.

<CENTER>

<H2>

And it was the Feast of the Passover</H2></CENTER>

He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type. Reads

it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some practice that.

mangiD. kcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with

his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear, O dear! All that

long business about that brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the

house of bondage <I>alleluia. Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu</I>. No, that's

the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacob's sons. And then the lamb and

the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher and then

the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills

the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well. Justice

it means but it's everybody eating everyone else. That's what life is after

all. How quickly he does that job. Practice makes perfect. Seems to see

with his fingers.



<P>Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on

to the landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch

him out perhaps? Better phone him up first. Number? Same as Citron's house.

Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Only once more that soap</H2></CENTER>

He went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all over these

walls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasy smell

there always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thom's next door when

I was there.



<P>He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, the soap

I put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back his handkerchief

he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned into the hip pocket of

his trousers.



<P>What perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram: something

I forgot. Just to see before dressing. No. Here. No.



<P>A sudden screech of laughter came from the <I>Evening Telegraph</I>

office. Know who that is. What's up? Pop in a minute to phone. Ned Lambert

it is.



<P>He entered softly.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Erin, Green Gem of the Silver Sea</H2></CENTER>

-- The ghost walks, professor Macllugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to

the dusty windowpane.



<P>Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert's quizzing

face, asked of it sourly:



<P>-- Agonising Christ, wouldn't it give you a heartburn on your arse?



<P>Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:



<P>-- <I>Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles

on its way, fanned by gentlest zephyrs tho' quarrelling with the stony

obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune's blue domain, mid mossy banks,

played on by the glorious sunlight or 'neath the shadows cast o'er its

pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest</I>.

What about that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his newspaper. How's

that for high?



<P>-- Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.



<P>Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:



<P><I>-- The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage</I>. O boys! O boys!



<P>-- And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again

on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.



<P>-- That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. I don't want

to hear any more of the stuff.



<P>He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered,

made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.



<P>High falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.

Rather upsets a man's day a funeral does. He has influence they say. Old

Chatterton, the vice-chancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle.

Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death written this long time

perhaps. Living to spite them. Might go first himself. Johnny, make room

for your uncle. The right honourable Hedges Eyre Chatterton. Daresay he

writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on gale days. Windfall when he kicks

out. Alleluia.



<P>-- Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.



<P>-- What is it? Mr Bloom asked.



<P>-- A recently discovered fragment of Cicero's, professor MacHugh answered

with pomp of tone. <I>Our lovely land</I>.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Short but to the Point</H2></CENTER>

-- Whose land? Mr Bloom said simply.



<P>-- Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. With

an accent on the whose.



<P>-- Dan Dawson's land, Mr Dedalus said.



<P>-- Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom asked.



<P>Ned Lambert nodded.



<P>-- But listen to this, he said.



<P>The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed

in.



<P>-- Excuse me, J.J. O'Molloy said, entering.



<P>Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.



<P>-- I beg yours, he said.



<P>-- Good day, Jack.



<P>-- Come in. Come in.



<P>-- Good day.



<P>-- How are you, Dedalus?



<P>-- Well. And yourself?



<P>J.J. O'Molloy shook his head.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Sad</H2></CENTER>

Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be. Decline poor chap. That

hectic flush spells finis for a man. Touch and go with him. What's in the

wind, I wonder. Money worry.



<P>-- <I>Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks</I>.



<P>-- You're looking extra.



<P>-- Is the editor to be seen? J.J. O'Molloy asked, looking towards the

inner door.



<P>-- Very much so, professor MacHugh said. To be seen and heard. He's

in his sanctum with Lenehan.



<P>J.J. O'Molloy strolled Jo the sloping desk and began to turn back the

pink pages of the file.



<P>Practice dwindling. A mighthavebeen. Losing heart. Gambling. Debts of

honour. Reaping the whirlwind. Used to get good retainers from D. and T.

Fitzgerald. Their wigs to show their grey matter. Brains on their sleeve

like the statue in Glasnevin. Believe he does some literary work for the

<I>Express</I> with Gabriel Conroy. Wellread fellow. Myles Crawford began

on the <I>Independent</I>. Funny the way those newspaper men veer about

when they get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold in the

same breath. Wouldn't know which to believe. One story good till you hear

the next. Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows

over. Hailfellow well met the next moment.



<P>-- Ah, listen to this for God's sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. <I>Or again

if we but climb the serried mountain peaks</I>...



<P>-- Bombast! the professor broke in testily. Enough of the inflated windbag!



<P>-- <I>Peaks</I>, Ned Lambert went on, <I>towering high on high, to bathe

our souls, as it were</I>...



<P>-- Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. Blessed and eternal God! Yes? Is

he taking anything for it?



<P>-- <I>As 'twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland's portfolio, unmatched,

despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for

very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland

of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild

mysterious Irish twilight</I>...

<CENTER>

<H2>

His Native Doric</H2></CENTER>

-- The moon, professor MacHugh said. He forgot Hamlet.



<P>-- <I>That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing

orb of the moon shines forth to irradiate her silver effulgence</I>.



<P>-- O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan, shite and onions!

That'll do, Ned. Life is too short.



<P>He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache,

welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.



<P>Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An instant

after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh's unshaven

black-spectacled face.



<P>-- Doughy Daw! he cried.

<CENTER>

<H2>

What Wetherup said</H2></CENTER>

All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot

cake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too wasn't he? Why they call

him Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged to that

chap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that nicely. Entertainments

open house. Big blow out. Wetherup always said that. Get a grip of them

by the stomach.



<P>The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested

by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared

about them and the harsh voice asked:



<P>-- What is it?



<P>-- And here comes the sham squire himself, professor MacHugh said grandly.



<P>-- Getououthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.



<P>-- Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink

after that.



<P>-- Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.



<P>-- Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.



<P>Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor's blue eyes roved

towards Mr Bloom's face, shadowed by a smile.



<P>-- Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Memorable Battles Recalled</H2></CENTER>

-- North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. We

won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!



<P>-- Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance

at his toecaps.



<P>-- In Ohio! the editor shouted.



<P>-- So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.



<P>Passing out, he whispered to J.J. O'Molloy:



<P>-- Incipient jigs. Sad case.



<P>-- Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet

face. My Ohio!



<P>-- A Perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long.

<CENTER>

<H2>

O, Harp Eolian</H2></CENTER>

He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking

off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed

teeth.



<P>-- Bingbang, bangbang.



<P>Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.



<P>-- Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an

ad.



<P>He went in.



<P>-- What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming

to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.



<P>-- That'll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you

fret. Hello, Jack. That's all right.



<P>-- Good day, Myles. J.J. O'Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip

limply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?



<P>The telephone whirred inside.



<P>-- Twenty eight... No, twenty... Double four . Yes.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Spot the Winner</H2></CENTER>

Lenehan came out of the inner office with <I>Sports</I> tissues.



<P>-- Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O.

Madden up.



<P>He tossed the tissues on to the table.



<P>Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was

flung open.



<P>-- Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.



<P>Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin

by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps.

The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls

and under the table came to earth.



<P>-- It wasn't me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.



<P>-- Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There's a hurricane

blowing.



<P>Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped

twice.



<P>-- Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was Pat

Farrel shoved me, sir.



<P>He pointed to two faces peering in round the door-frame.



<P>-- Him, sir.



<P>-- Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.



<P>He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.



<P>J.J. O'Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:



<P>-- Continued on page six, column four.



<P>-- Yes... <I>Evening Telegraph</I> here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner

office. Is the boss... ? Yes, <I>Telegraph</I>... To where?... Aha! Which

auction rooms?... Aha! I see... Right. I'll catch him.

<CENTER>

<H2>

A Collision ensues</H2></CENTER>

The bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped against

Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.



<P>-- <I>Pardon, monsieur</I>, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant

and making a grimace.



<P>-- My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I'm in

a hurry.



<P>-- Knee, Lenehan said.



<P>He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee.



<P>-- The accumulation of the <I>anno Domini</I>.



<P>-- Sorry, Mr Bloom said.



<P>He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J.J. O'Molloy slapped

the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed

in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:

<BLOCKQUOTE>We are the boys of Wexford

<BR>Who fought with heart and hand.</BLOCKQUOTE>



<CENTER>

<H2>

Exit Bloom</H2></CENTER>

-- I'm just running round to Bachelor's walk, Mr Bloom said, about this

ad of Keyes's. Want to fix it up. They tell me he's round there in Dillon's.



<P>He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,

leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand suddenly

stretched forth an arm amply.



<P>-- Begone! he said. The world is before you.



<P>-- Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.



<P>J.J. O'Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan's hand and read them, blowing

them apart gently, without comment.



<P>-- He'll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through

his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps

after him.



<P>-- Show! Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.

<CENTER>

<H2>

A Street Cortege</H2></CENTER>

Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr

Bloom's wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a

tail of white bowknots.



<P>-- Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said,

and you'll kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the

walk. Small nines. Steal upon larks.



<P>He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding

feet past the fireplace to J.J. O'Molloy who placed the tissues in his

receiving hands.



<P>-- What's that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other

two gone?



<P>-- Who? the professor said, turning. They're gone round to the Oval

for a drink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.



<P>-- Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Where's my hat?



<P>He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket,

jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the air and

against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.



<P>-- He's pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voIce.



<P>-- Seems to be, J.J. O'Molloy said, taking out a cigarette case in murmuring

meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the most matches?

<CENTER>

<H2>

The Calumet of Peace</H2></CENTER>

He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan promptly

struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J.J. O'Molloy

opened his case again and offered it.



<P>-- <I>Thanky vous</I>, Lenehan said, helping himself.



<P>The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.

He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:

<BLOCKQUOTE>'Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,

<BR>'Twas empire charmed thy heart.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The professor grinned, locking his long lips.



<P>-- Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.



<P>He took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him

with quick grace, said:



<P>-- Silence for my brandnew riddle!



<P>-- <I>Imperium romanum</I>, J.J. O'Molloy said gently. It sounds nobler

than British or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.



<P>Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.



<P>-- That's it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the

fire. We haven't got the chance of a snowball in hell.

<CENTER>

<H2>

The Grandeur that was Rome</H2></CENTER>

-- Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. We mustn't

be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome, imperial, imperious,

imperative.



<P>He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:



<P>-- What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloac&amp;Aelig;:

sewers. The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: <I>It is

meet to be here. Let us build an altar to Jehovah</I>. The Roman, like

the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore

on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal

obsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: <I>It is meet to

be here. Let us construct a watercloset.</I>



<P>-- Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Our old ancient ancestors,

as we read in the first chapter of Guinness's, were partial to the running

stream.



<P>-- They were nature's gentlemen, J.J. O'Molloy murmured. But we have

also Roman law.



<P>-- And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.



<P>-- Do you know that story about chief Baron Palles? J.J. O'Molloy asked.

It was at the royal university dinner. Everything was going swimmingly.



<P>-- First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?



<P>Mr O'Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from

the hallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.



<P>-- <I>Entrez, mes enfants!</I> Lenehan cried.



<P>-- I escort a suppliant, Mr O'Madden Burke said melodiously. Youth led

by Experience visits Notoriety.



<P>-- How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Your

governor is just gone.

<CENTER>

<H2>

? ? ?</H2></CENTER>

Lenehan said to all:



<P>-- Silence! What opera resembles a railway line? Reflect, ponder, excogitate,

reply.



<P>Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.



<P>-- Who? the editor asked.



<P>Bit torn off.



<P>-- Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said:



<P>-- That old pelters, the editor said. Who tore it? Was he short taken.

<BLOCKQUOTE>On swift sail flaming

<BR>From storm and south

<BR>He comes, pale vampire,

<BR>Mouth to my mouth.</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their shoulders.

Foot and mouth? Are you turned... ?



<P>Bullockbefriending bard.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Shindy in wellknown Restaurant</H2></CENTER>

-- Good day, sir, Stephen answered, blushing. The letter is not mine. Mr

Garrett Deasy asked me to...



<P>-- O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and knew his wife too. The bloodiest

old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease

and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter's face in the

Star and Garter. Oho!



<P>A woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus,

ten years the Greeks. O'Rourke, prince of Breffni.



<P>-- Is he a widower? Stephen asked.



<P>-- Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript.

Emperor's horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on the ramparts

of Vienna. Don't you forget! Maximilian Karl O'Donnell, graf von Tirconnel

in Ireland. Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrian fieldmarshal

now. Going to be trouble there one day. Wild geese. O yes, every time.

Don't you forget that!



<P>-- The moot point is did he forget it? J.J. O'Molloy said quietly, turning

a horseshoe paperweight. Saving princes is a thank you job.



<P>Professor MacHugh turned on him.



<P>-- And if not? he said.



<P>-- I'll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. Hungarian it was

one day...

Lost Causes Noble Marquess mentioned</H2></CENTER>

We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success for us

is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never loyal

to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin language. I

speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time

is money. Material domination. <I>Dominus!</I> Lord! Where is the spirituality?

Lord Jesus! Lord Salisbury. A sofa in a westend club. But the Greek!

<H2>

Kyrie Eleison!</H2></CENTER>

A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.



<P>-- The Greek! he said again. <I>Kyrios!</I> Shining word! The vowels

the Semite and the Saxon know not. <I>Kyrie!</I> The radiance of the intellect.

I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind. <I>Kyrie eleison!</I>

The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.

We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered

at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an <I>imperium</I>, that

went under with the Athenian fleets at &amp;Aelig;gospotami. Yes, yes.

They went under. Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve

the fortunes of Greece. Loyal to a lost cause.



<P>He strode away from them towards the window.



<P>-- They went forth to battle, Mr O'Madden Burke said greyly, but they

always fell.



<P>-- Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise. Owing to a brick received

in the latter half of the <I>matin&eacute;e</I>. Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!



<P>He whispered then near Stephen's ear:

<H2>

Lenehan's Limerick</H2></CENTER>



<BLOCKQUOTE>There's a ponderous pundit MacHugh

<BR>Who wears goggles of ebony hue.

<BR>As he mostly sees double

<BR>To wear them why trouble?

<BR>I can't see the Joe Miller. Can you?</BLOCKQUOTE>

In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.



<P>Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.



<P>-- That'll be all right, he said. I'll read the rest after. That'll

be all right.



<P>Lenehan extended his hands in protest.



<P>-- But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railway line?



<P>-- Opera? Mr O'Madden Burke's sphinx face reriddled.



<P>Lenehan announced gladly:



<P>-- <I>The Rose of Castille</I>. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel.

Gee!



<P>He poked Mr O'Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr O'Madden Burke fell

back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.



<P>-- Help! he sighed. I feel a strong weakness.



<P>Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling

tissues.



<P>The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across

Stephen's and Mr O'Madden Burke's loose ties.



<P>-- Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.



<P>-- Like fellows who had blown up the bastille, J.J. O'Molloy said in

quiet mockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between

you? You look as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Omnium Gatherum</H2></CENTER>

-- We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.



<P>-- All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics.



<P>-- The turf, Lenehan put in.



<P>-- Literature, the press.



<P>-- If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of advertisement.



<P>-- And Madam Bloom, Mr O'Madden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublin's

prime favourite.



<P>Lenehan gave a loud cough.



<P>-- Ahem! he said very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught

a cold in the park. The gate was open.

<CENTER>

<H2>

You can do it!</H2></CENTER>

The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen's shoulder.



<P>-- I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a bite

in it. You can do it. I see it in your face. <I>In the lexicon of youth</I>...



<P>See it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.



<P>-- Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective. Great

nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing the public!

Give them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn its soul.

Father Son and Holy Ghost and fakes M'Carthy.



<P>-- We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O'Madden Burke said.



<P>Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.



<P>-- He wants you for the pressgang, J.J. O'Molloy said.

<CENTER>

<H2>

The Great Gallaher</H2></CENTER>

-- You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.

Wait a minute. We'll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when

he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence. Gallaher,

that was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You know how he made his mark?

I'll tell you. That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known. That

was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the

Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose. I'll show you.



<P>He pushed past them to the files.



<P>-- Look at here, he said, turning. The <I>New York World</I> cabled

for a special. Remember that time?



<P>Professor MacHugh nodded.



<P>-- <I>New York World</I>, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his

straw hat. Where it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean, Joe Brady

and the rest of them. Where Skin-the-goat drove the car. Whole route, see?



<P>-- Skin-the-goat, Mr O'Madden Burke said. Fitzharris. He has that cabman's

shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me. You know

Holohan?



<P>-- Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.



<P>-- And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones

for the corporation. A night watchman.



<P>Stephen turned in surprise.



<P>-- Gumley? he said. You don't say so? A friend of my father's, is he?



<P>-- Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mind

the stones, see they don't run away. Look at here. What did Ignatius Gallaher

do? I'll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away. Have you <I>Weekly

Freeman</I> of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?



<P>He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.



<P>-- Take page four, advertisement for Bransome's coffee let us say. Have

you got that? Right.



<P>The telephone whirred.

<CENTER>

<H2>

A distant voice</H2></CENTER>

-- I'll answer it, the professor said going.



<P>-- B is parkgate. Good.



<P>His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.



<P>-- T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroon

gate.



<P>The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock's wattles. An illstarched

dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.



<P>-- Hello? <I>Evening Telegraph</I> here... Hello?... Who's there?...

Yes... Yes...



<P>-- F to P is the route Skin-the-goat drove the car for an alibi. Inchicore,

Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F. A. B. P. Got that?

X is Davy's publichouse in upper Leeson street.



<P>The professor came to the inner door.



<P>-- Bloom is at the telephone, he said.



<P>-- Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Burke's publichouse,

see?

<CENTER>

<H2>

Clever, Very</H2></CENTER>

Clever, Lenehan said. Very.



<P>-- Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody

history.



<P>Nightmare from which you will never awake.



<P>-- I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present, Dick Adams, the

besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and

myself.



<P>Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:



<P>-- Madam, I'm Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.



<P>-- History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Prince's street was

there first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of

an advertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the

leg up. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the <I>Star</I>.

Now he's got in with Blumenfeld. That's press. That's talent. Pyatt! He

was all their daddies.



<P>-- The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the brother-in-law

of Chris Callinan.



<P>-- Hello?... Are you there?... Yes, he's here still. Come across yourself.



<P>-- Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried.

He flung the pages down.



<P>-- Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O'Madden Burke.



<P>-- Very smart, Mr O'Madden Burke said.



<P>Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.



<P>-- Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers

were up before the recorder...



<P>-- O yes, J.J. O'Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home through

the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last

year and thought she'd buy a view of Dublin. And it turned out to be a

commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin-the-goat. Right

outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!



<P>-- They're only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.

Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those

fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O'Hagan? Eh?

Ah, bloody nonsense! Only in the halfpenny place!



<P>His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.



<P>Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why did

you write it then?

<CENTER>

<H2>

Rhymes and Reasons</H2></CENTER>

Mouth, south. Is the mouth south someway? Or the south a mouth? Must be

some. South, pout, out, shout, drouth. Rhymes: two men dressed the same,

looking the same, two by two.

<P>-- Speak up for yourself, Mr O'Madden Burke said.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Sufficient for the Day...</H2></CENTER>

J.J. O'Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.



<P>-- My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false

construction on my words. I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the

third profession <I>qua</I> profession but your Cork legs are running away

with you. Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and

Edmund Burke? Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth

of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery gutter sheet

not to mention <I>Paddy Kelly's Budget, Pue's Occurrences</I> and our watchful

friend <I>The Skibereen Eagle</I>. Why bring in a master of forensic eloquence

like Whiteside? Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Links with Bygone Days of Yore</H2></CENTER>

Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his face.

Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established 1763. Dr Lucas. Who have

you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!



<P>-- Well, J.J. O'Molloy said, Bushe K. C., for example.



<P>-- Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes. Bushe, yes. He has a strain of

it in his blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.



<P>-- He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only

for... But no matter.



<P>J.J. O'Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:



<P>-- One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my

life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of fratricide,

the Childs murder case. Bushe defended him.

<BLOCKQUOTE>And in the porches of mine ear did pour.</BLOCKQUOTE>

By the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or the other

story, beast with two backs?



<P>-- What was that? the professor asked.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Italia, Magistra Artium</H2></CENTER>

-- He spoke on the law of evidence, J.J. O'Molloy said, of Roman justice

as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the <I>lex talionis</I>. And

he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the Vatican.



<P>-- Ha.



<P>-- A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!



<P>Pause. J.J. O'Molloy took out his cigarette case. False lull. Something

quite ordinary.



<P>Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.



<P>I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that

it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,

that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.

<CENTER>

<H2>

A Polished Period</H2></CENTER>

J.J. O'Molloy resumed, moulding his words:



<P>-- He said of it: <I>that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible,

of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and prophecy which

if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble

of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves

to live</I>.



<P>His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.



<P>-- Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.



<P>-- The divine afflatus, Mr O'Madden Burke said.



<P>-- You like it? J.J. O'Molloy asked Stephen.



<P>Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.

He took a cigarette from the case. J.J. O'Molloy offered his case to Myles

Crawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying:



<P>-- Muchibus thankibus.

<CENTER>

<H2>

A Man of High Morale</H2></CENTER>

-- Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.J. O'Molloy said

to Stephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush

poets: A. E. the master mystic? That Blavatsky woman started it. She was

a nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer

that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about

planes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.

E.'s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.



<P>Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say

about me? Don't ask.



<P>-- No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarette case aside.

Wait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I ever

heard was a speech made by John F. Taylor at the college historical society.

Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and

the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the

revival of the Irish tongue.



<P>He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:



<P>-- You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his

discourse.



<P>-- He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.J. O'Molloy said, rumour has it,

on the Trinity college estates commission.



<P>-- He is sitting with a sweet thing in a child's frock, Myles Crawford

said. Go on. Well?



<P>-- It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,

full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction, I will

not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man's contumely upon

the new movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak, therefore worthless.



<P>He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised

an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger

touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Impromptu</H2></CENTER>

In ferial tone he addressed J.J. O'Molloy:



<P>-- Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sick bed. That he had

prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter

in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it.

He wore a loose neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not)

a dying man.



<P>His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.J. O'Molloy's towards Stephen's

face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His unglazed linen collar

appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair. Still seeking,

he said:



<P>-- When Fitzgibbon's speech had ended John F. Taylor rose to reply.

Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.



<P>He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more.

Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.



<P>He began:



<P>-- <I>Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in

listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since

by my learned friend. It seemed to me that I had been transported into

a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age,

that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of

some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses</I>.



<P>His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smoke ascending

in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. <I>And let our crooked smokes</I>.

Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand at it yourself?



<P>-- <I>And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest

raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard his words

and their meaning was revealed to me.</I>

<CENTER>

<H2>

From the Fathers</H2></CENTER>

It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted

which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could

be corrupted. Ah, curse you! That's saint Augustine.



<P>-- <I>Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our

language? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen; we are a mighty people. You

have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our

galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow

the waters of the known globe. You have but emerged from primitive conditions:

we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a polity</I>.



<P>Nile.



<P>Child, man, effigy.



<P>By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple

in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.



<P>-- <I>You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and

mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours

serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Israel is weak

and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms. Vagrants

and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our name</I>.



<P>A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it

boldly:



<P>-- <I>But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to

and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will

and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have

brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the

pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the Eternal

amid lightnings on Sinai's mountaintop nor ever have come down with the

light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms

the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw</I>.



<P>He ceased and looked at them, enjoying silence.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Ominous - for Him!</H2></CENTER>

J.J. O'Molloy said not without regret:



<P>-- And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.



<P>-- A sudden - at - the - moment - though - from - lingering - illness

- often - previously - expectorated - demise, Lenehan said. And with a

great future behind him.



<P>The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering

up the staircase.



<P>-- That is oratory, the professor said, uncontradicted.



<P>Gone with the wind. Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles

of ears of porches. The tribune's words howled and scattered to the four

winds. A people sheltered within his voice. Dead noise. Akasic records

of all that ever anywhere wherever was. Love and laud him: me no more



<P>I have money.



<P>-- Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda paper may

I suggest that the house do now adjourn?



<P>-- You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment?

Mr O'Madden Burke asked. 'Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically

speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.



<P>-- That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All who are in favour

say ay, Lenehan announced. The contrary no. I declare it carried. To which

particular boosing shed?... My casting vote is: Mooney's!



<P>He led the way, admonishing:



<P>-- We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?

Yes, we will not. By no manner of means.



<P>Mr O'Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally's lunge of his

umbrella:



<P>-- Lay on, Macduff!



<P>-- Chip of the old block! the editor cried, slapping Stephen on the

shoulder. Let us go. Where are those blasted keys?



<P>He fumbled in his pocket, pulling out the crushed typesheets.



<P>-- Foot and mouth. I know. That'll be all right. That'll go



<P>in. Where are they? That's all right.



<P>He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Let Us Hope</H2></CENTER>

J.J. O'Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:



<P>-- I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.



<P>He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.



<P>-- Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine, isn't it?

It has the prophetic vision. <I>Fuit Ilium!</I> The sack of windy Troy.

Kingdoms of this world. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen

today.



<P>The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and

rushed out into the street, yelling:



<P>-- Racing special!



<P>Dublin. I have much, much to learn.



<P>They turned to the left along Abbey street.



<P>-- I have a vision too, Stephen said.



<P>-- Yes, the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford will

follow.



<P>Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:



<P>-- Racing special!

<CENTER>

<H2>

Dear Dirty Dublin</H2></CENTER>

Dubliners.



<P>-- Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty

and fiftythree years in Fumbally's lane.



<P>-- Where is that? the professor asked.



<P>-- Off Blackpitts.



<P>Damp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Face glistening

tallow under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records. Quicker,

darlint!



<P>On now. Dare it. Let there be life.



<P>-- They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson's pillar.

They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. They shake

out the threepenny bits and a sixpence and coax out the pennies with the

blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.

They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for

fear it may come on to rain.



<P>-- Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Life on the Raw</H2></CENTER>

-- They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf

at the north city dining rooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins,

proprietress... They purchase-our and twenty ripe plums from a girl at

the foot of Nelson's pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn. They give

two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle

slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid

of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising

God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.

Glory be to God. They had no idea it was that high.



<P>Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns has the

lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water given her by a lady who got

a bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen

and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.



<P>-- Antithesis, the professor said, nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I

can see them. What's keeping our friend?



<P>He turned.



<P>A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scampering in all

directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after them Myles

Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking

with J.J. O'Molloy.



<P>-- Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.



<P>He set off again to walk by Stephen's side.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Return of Bloom</H2></CENTER>

-- Yes, he said. I see them.



<P>-- Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the

offices of the <I>Irish Catholic</I> and <I>Dublin Penny Journal</I>, called:



<P>-- Mr Crawford! A moment!



<P>-- <I>Telegraph!</I> Racing special!



<P>-- What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace. A newsboy cried

in Mr Bloom's face:



<P>-- Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!

<CENTER>

<H2>

Interview with the Editor</H2></CENTER>

Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing,

and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyes just now.

He'll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he'll see. But he wants

a par to call attention in the <I>Telegraph</I> too, the Saturday pink.

And he wants it if it's not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the

<I>Kilkenny People</I>. I can have access to it in the national library.

House of keys, don't you see? His name is Keyes. It's a play on the name.

But he practically promised he'd give the renewal. But he wants just a

little puff. What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?

<CENTER>

<H2>

K. M. A.</H2></CENTER>

Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said, throwing out

his arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.



<P>A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm.

Lenehan's yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder is that

young Dedalus the moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on him today.

Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in muck somewhere.

Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?



<P>-- Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design

I suppose it's worth a short par. He'd give the ad I think. I'll tell him...



<P>-- He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over

his shoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.



<P>While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode

on jerkily.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Raising the Wind</H2></CENTER>

-- <I>Nulla bona</I>, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. I'm

up to here. I've been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow

to back a bill for me no later than last week. You must take the will for

the deed. Sorry, Jack. With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind

anyhow.



<P>J. J. O'Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught

up on the others and walked abreast.



<P>-- When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty

fingers in the paper the beard was wrapped in, they go nearer to the railings.



<P>-- Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two

old Dublin women on the top of Nelson's pillar.

<CENTER>

<H2>

Some Column! - That's What Waddler One Said</H2></CENTER>

-- That's new, Myles Crawford said. That's copy. Out for the waxies' Dargle.

Two old trickies, what?



<P>-- But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see

the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines'

blue dome, Adam and Eve's, saint Laurence O'Toole's. But it makes them

giddy to look so they pull up their skirts...

<CENTER>

<H2>

Those Slightly Rambunctious Females</H2></CENTER>

the plumstones slowly out between the railings.

MARTIN CUNNINGHAM, FIRST, POKED HIS SILKHATTED HEAD INTO the creaking carriage

and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after him, curving

his height with care.



<P>-- Come on, Simon.



<P>-- After you, Mr Bloom said.



<P>Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:



<P>-- Yes, yes.



<P>-- Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.



<P>Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to

after him and slammed it tight till it shut tight. He passed an arm through

the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriage window at the

lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman peeping.

Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she was passed

over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad to see us

go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them. Huggermugger

in corners. Slop about in slipper-slappers for fear he'd wake. Then getting

it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed. Pull it

more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who will touch you dead.

Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and the hair. Keep a bit

in an envelope. Grow all the same after. Unclean job.



<P>All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am

sitting on something hard. Ah, that soap in my hip pocket. Better shift

it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.



<P>All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front turning: then nearer:

then horses' hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and

swaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of

the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. At

walking pace.



<P>They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were

passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels rattled

rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling

in the doorframes.



<P>-- What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.



<P>-- Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.



<P>Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.



<P>-- That's a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died

out.



<P>All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.

Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past

Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning,

a wide hat.



<P>-- There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.



<P>-- Who is that?



<P>-- Your son and heir.



<P>-- Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.



<P>The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway

before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back

to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus

fell back, saying:



<P>-- Was that Mulligan cad with him? His <I>fidus Achates?</I>



<P>-- No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.



<P>-- Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding

faction, the drunken little cost-drawer and Crissie, papa's little lump

of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.



<P>Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros the bottleworks.

Dodder bridge.



<P>Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls

the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing

in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady's

two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night. Beginning to

tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironing his back. Thinks

he'll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are. About six hundred per

cent profit.



<P>-- He's in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is

a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks

all over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I'Il make

it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his

aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. I `Il

tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.



<P>He cried above the clatter of the wheels.



<P>-- I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counter-jumper's

son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's. Not likely.



<P>He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power's mild

face and Martin Cunningham's eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy selfwilled

man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If little Rudy

had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house. Walking beside

Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange feeling it would

be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace

she was at the window, watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease

to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up. She had that cream gown on with

the rip she never stitched. Give us a touch, Poldy. God, I'm dying for

it. How life begins.



<P>Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her.

I could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn

German too.



<P>-- Are we late? Mr Power asked.



<P>-- Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch



<P>Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping Jupiter!

Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she's a dear girl. Soon be a woman. Mullingar.

Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too. Life. Life.



<P>The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.



<P>-- Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.



<P>-- He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn't that squint troubling him.

Do you follow me?



<P>He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs

from under his thighs.



<P>-- What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?



<P>-- Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr

Power said.



<P>All raised their thighs, eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless

leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and

said:



<P>-- Unless I'm greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?



<P>-- It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.



<P>Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite

clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.



<P>Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.



<P>-- After all, he said, it's the most natural thing in the world.



<P>-- Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak

of his beard gently.



<P>-- Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.



<P>-- And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.



<P>-- At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.



<P>-- I met M'Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he'd try to come.



<P>The carriage halted short.



<P>-- What's wrong?



<P>-- We're stopped.



<P>-- Where are we?



<P>Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.



<P>-- The grand canal, he said.



<P>Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got

it. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame

really. Got off lightly with illness compared. Only measles. Flaxseed tea.

Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don't miss this

chance. Dogs' home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold,

is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave. A dying scrawl.

He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men's dogs usually are.



<P>A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower

spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander.

I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.



<P>-- The weather is changing, he said quietly.



<P>-- A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.



<P>-- Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There's the sun again coming

out.



<P>Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled

a mute curse at the sky.



<P>-- It's as uncertain as a child's bottom, he said.



<P>-- We're off again.



<P>The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.

Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.



<P>-- Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking

him off to his face.



<P>-- O draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear

him, Simon, on Ben Dollard's singing of <I>The Croppy Boy</I>.



<P>-- Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. <I>His singing of that

simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in

the whole course of my experience</I>.



<P>-- Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He's dead nuts on that. And the

retrospective arrangement.



<P>-- Did you read Dan Dawson's speech? Martin Cunningham asked.



<P>-- I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?



<P>-- In the paper this morning.



<P>Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change

for her.



<P>-- No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on, please.



<P>Mr Bloom's glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the

deaths. Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake

is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne's? no, Sexton, Urbright.

Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper. Thanks to the

Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of his. Aged 88

after a long and tedious illness. Month's mind. Quinlan. On whose soul

Sweet Jesus have mercy.

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is now a month since dear Henry fled

<BR>To his home up above in the sky

<BR>While his family weeps and mourns his loss

<BR>Hoping some day to meet him on high.</BLOCKQUOTE>

I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it

in the bath? He patted his waistcoat pocket. There all right. Dear Henry

fled. Before my patience are exhausted.



<P>National school. Meade's yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding.

Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round

with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their

hats.



<P>A pointsman's back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway

standard by Mr Bloom's window. Couldn't they invent something automatic

so that the wheel itself much handler? Well but that fellow would lose

his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new

invention?



<P>Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a

crape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law, perhaps.



<P>They went past the bleak pulpit of Saint Mark's, under the railway bridge,

past the Queen's theatre: in silence. Hoardings. Eugene Stratton. Mrs Bandman

Palmer. Could I go to see <I>Leah</I> tonight, I wonder. I said I. Or the

<I>Lily of Killarney?</I> Elster Grimes Opera company. Big powerful change.

Wet bright bills for next week. <I>Fun on the Bristol</I>. Martin Cunningham

could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink or two. As broad

as it's long.



<P>He's coming in the afternoon. Her songs.



<P>Plasto's. Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust. Who was he?



<P>-- How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow

in salute.



<P>-- He doesn't see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?



<P>-- Who? Mr Dedalus asked.



<P>-- Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.



<P>Just that moment I was thinking.



<P>Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the

white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: passed.



<P>Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right

hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?

Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes

feel what a person Is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am just

looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body getting a

bit softy. I would notice that from remembering. What causes that I suppose

the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off. But the

shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night

of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.



<P>He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant

glance over their faces.



<P>Mr Power asked:



<P>-- How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?



<P>-- O very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It's a good

idea, you see .



<P>-- Are you going yourself?



<P>-- Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the

county Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the

chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.



<P>-- Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.



<P>-- Have you good artists?



<P>-- Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we'll have all

topnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in fact.



<P>-- And <I>Madame</I>, Mr Power said, smiling. Last but not least.



<P>Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped

them. Smith O'Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman.

Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by

Farrell's statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.



<P>Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his

mouth opening: oot.



<P>-- Four bootlaces for a penny.



<P>Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street.

Same house as Molly's namesake. Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.

Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too. Terrible

comedown, poor wretch! kicked about like snuff at a wake. O'Callaghan on

his last legs.



<P>And <I>Madame</I>. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.

Doing her hair, humming: <I>voglio e non vorrei</I>. No: <I>vorrei e non</I>.

Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. <I>Mi trema

un poco il</I>. Beautiful on that <I>tre</I> her voice is: weeping tone.

A thrust. A throstle. There is a word throstle that expressed that.



<P>His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power's goodlooking face. Greyish over

the ears. <I>Madame</I>: smiling. I smiled back. A smile does a long way.

Only politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the

woman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it told

me, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played out pretty

quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of

rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury's. Or the Moira, was it?



<P>They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator's form.



<P>Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.



<P>-- Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.



<P>A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner

of Elvery's elephant house showed them a curved hand open on his spine.



<P>-- In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.



<P>Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:



<P>-- The devil break the hasp of your back!



<P>Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as

the carriage passed Gray's statue.



<P>-- We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.



<P>His eyes met Mr Bloom's eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:



<P>-- Well, nearly all of us.



<P>Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions' faces.

-- That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J. and

the son.



<P>-- About the boatman? Mr Power asked.



<P>-- Yes. Isn't it awfully good?



<P>-- What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn't hear it.



<P>-- There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to

send him to the isle of Man out of harm's way but when they were both...



<P>-- What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?



<P>-- Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he

tried to drown...



<P>-- Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!



<P>Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.



<P>-- No, Mr Bloom said the son himself...



<P>Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely.



<P>-- Reuben J. and the son were piking it down the quay next the river

on their way to the isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got

loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.



<P>-- For God's sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?



<P>-- Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished

him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father

on the quay. More dead than alive. Half the town was there.



<P>-- Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is...



<P>-- And Reuben J., Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin

for saving his son's life.



<P>A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power's hand.



<P>-- O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.



<P>-- Isn't it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.



<P>-- One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily. Mr Power's choked

laugh burst quietly in the carriage. Nelson's pillar.



<P>-- Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!



<P>-- We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.



<P>Mr Dedalus sighed.



<P>-- And then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a

laugh. Many a good one he told himself.



<P>-- The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his

fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and

he was in his usual health that I'd be driving after him like this. He's

gone from us.



<P>-- As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went

very suddenly.



<P>-- Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.



<P>He tapped his chest sadly.



<P>Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose.

Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent colouring

it.



<P>Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.



<P>-- He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.



<P>-- The best death, Mr Bloom said.



<P>Their wide open eyes looked at him.



<P>-- No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.



<P>No-one spoke.



<P>Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents, temperance

hotel, Falconer's railway guide, civil service college, Gill's, catholic

club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or wind. At night too.

Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew. Foundation

stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.



<P>White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner,

galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning coach.

Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for a nun.



<P>-- Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.



<P>A dwarf's face mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. Dwarf's body,

weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society pays.

Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant nothing.

Mistake of nature. If it's healthy it's from the mother. If not the man.

Better luck next time.



<P>-- Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It's well out of it.



<P>The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle

his bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.



<P>-- In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.



<P>-- But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own

life.



<P>Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.



<P>-- The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.



<P>-- Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.

We must take a charitable view of it.



<P>-- They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.



<P>-- It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.



<P>Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham's

large eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent.

Like Shakespeare's face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy

on that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to drive

a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn't broken

already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the riverbed clutching

rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a wife of his. Setting

up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him

every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the damned. Wear the heart

out of a stone, that. Monday morning start afresh. Shoulder to the wheel.

Lord, she must have looked a sight that night, Dedalus told me he was in

there. Drunk about the place and capering with Martin's umbrella:

<BLOCKQUOTE>And they call me the jewel of Asia,

<BR>Of Asia,

<BR>The geisha.</BLOCKQUOTE>

He looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.



<P>That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table.

The room in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through

the slats of the Venetian blinds. The coroner's ears, big and hairy. Boots

giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like yellow streaks

on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. Verdict: overdose.

Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son Leopold.



<P>No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.



<P>The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.



<P>-- We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.



<P>-- God grant he doesn't upset us on the road, Mr Power said.



<P>-- I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow

in Germany. The Gordon Bennett.



<P>-- Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.



<P>As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent

over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody

here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead march from <I>Saul</I>. He's

as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The <I>Mater

Misericordiae</I>. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward

for incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady's Hospice for the dying.

Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They look terrible

the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon. Then the

screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student that was dressed

that bite the bee gave me. He's gone over to the lying-in hospital they

told me. From one extreme to the other.



<P>The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.



<P>-- What's wrong now?



<P>A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching

by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups.

Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.



<P>-- Emigrants, Mr Power said.



<P>-- Huuuh! the drover's voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.

Huuuh! Out of that!



<P>Thursday of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold them

about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roast beef for old

England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter is

lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a

year. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,

soap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off

the train at Clonsilla.



<P>The carriage moved on through the drove.



<P>-- I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from

the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken

in trucks down to the boats.



<P>-- Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.

Quite right. They ought to.



<P>-- Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought is to have

municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line

out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and

all. Don't you see what I mean?



<P>-- O that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon

diningroom.



<P>-- A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.



<P>-- Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn't it be more decent

than galloping two abreast?



<P>-- Well, there's something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.



<P>-- And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn't have scenes like that when

the hearse capsized round Dunphy's and upset the coffin on to the road.



<P>-- That was terrible, Mr Power's shocked face said, and the corpse fell

about the road. Terrible!



<P>-- First round Dunphy's, Mr Dedalus aid, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.



<P>-- Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.



<P>Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam

shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large

for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what's up now. Quite

right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose quickly.

Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax. The sphincter

loose. Seal up all.



<P>-- Dunphy's, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.



<P>Dunphy's corner. Mourning coaches drawn up drowning their grief. A pause

by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we'll pull up here on

the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation. Elixir of

life.



<P>But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him

in the knocking about? He would and he wouldn't, I suppose. Depends on

where. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It

would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.



<P>In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted

by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.



<P>Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.



<P>Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping

barge between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered

horse. Aboard of the <I>Bugabu</I>.



<P>Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on

his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds,

over slime, mud-choked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley,

I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or cycle down. Hire

some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at the auction but a

lady's. Developing waterways. James M'Cann's hobby to row me o'er the ferry.

Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats. Camping out. Also hearses.

To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without writing. Come as a surprise,

Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down, lock by lock to Dublin. With turf from

the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his brown strawhat, saluting Paddy

Dignam.



<P>They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.



<P>-- I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.



<P>-- Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.



<P>-- How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping I suppose.



<P>-- Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.



<P>The carriage steered left for Finglas road.



<P>The stonecutter's yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of

land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,

knelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence:

appealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder and

sculptor.



<P>Passed.



<P>On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary the sexton's an old tramp sat, grumbling,

emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot. After

life's journey.



<P>Gloomy gardens then went by, one by one: gloomy houses.



<P>Mr Power pointed.



<P>-- That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.



<P>-- So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him

off. Murdered his brother. Or so they said.



<P>-- The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.



<P>-- Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham said. That's the maxim of

the law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person

to be wrongfully condemned.



<P>They looked. Murderer's ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered, tenantless,

unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned. Murder.

The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered. They love reading about

it. Man's head found in a garden. Her clothing consisted of. How she met

her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used. Murderer is still at large.

Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed. Murder will out.



<P>Cramped in this carriage. She mightn't like me to come that way without

letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with their

pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.



<P>The high railings of Prospects rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars,

rare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees,

white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures

on the air.



<P>The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham

put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with

his knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.



<P>Change that soap now. Mr Bloom's hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly

and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket. He

stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still

held.



<P>Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It's all the same. Pallbearers,

gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death. Beyond the hind

carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit. Simnel cakes

those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead. Dogbiscuits. Who ate them?

Mourners coming out.



<P>He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes

walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took

out the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.



<P>Where is that child's funeral disappeared to?



<P>A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging

through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block.

The waggoner marching at their head saluted.



<P>Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at

it with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing

on a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here every

day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount Jerome for

the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute. Shovelling

them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands every hour. Too many

in the world.



<P>Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy,

hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl's face stained with dirt

and tears, holding the woman's arm looking up at her for a sign to cry.

Fish's face, bloodless and livid.



<P>The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So

much dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First

the stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy followed

with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the brother-in-law.



<P>All walked after.



<P>Martin Cunningham whispered:



<P>-- I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.



<P>-- What? Mr Power whispered. How so?



<P>-- His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the

Queen's hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare. Anniversary.



<P>-- O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself!



<P>He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed

towards the cardinal's mausoleum. Speaking.



<P>-- Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.



<P>-- I believe so, Mr Kernan answered, but the policy was heavily mortgaged.

Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.



<P>-- How many children did he leave?



<P>-- Five. Ned Lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into Todd's.



<P>-- A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.



<P>-- A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.



<P>-- Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.



<P>Has the laugh at him now.



<P>He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had outlived

him, lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must outlive

the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the world. Condole

with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you'll soon follow him. For Hindu

widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who knows after? Widowhood

not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on a guncarriage. Victoria

and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But in the end she put a few violets

in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of hearts. All for a shadow. Consort not

even a king. Her son was the substance. Something new to hope for not like

the past she wanted back, waiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone

under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.



<P>-- How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven't

seen you for a month of Sundays.



<P>-- Never better. How are all in Cork's own town?



<P>-- I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert

said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.



<P>-- And how is Dick, the solid man?



<P>-- Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.



<P>-- By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?



<P>-- Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert

said, pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the

insurance is cleared up.



<P>-- Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?



<P>-- Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife's brother. John Henry Menton

is behind. He put down his name for a quid.



<P>-- I'll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought

to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.



<P>-- How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?



<P>-- Many a good man's fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.



<P>They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind

the boy with the wreath, looking down at his sleek combed hair and the

slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there

when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last moment and recognise

for the last time. All he might have done. I owe three shillings to O'Grady.

Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel. Which end

is his head.



<P>After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.

The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles

at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath

at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners knelt here

and there in praying desks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when

all had knelt dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket

and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black hat gently on his

left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.



<P>A server, bearing a brass bucket with something in it, came out through

a door. The whitesmocked priest came after him tidying his stole with one

hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad's belly.

Who'll read the book? I, said the rook.



<P>They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book

with a fluent croak.



<P>Father Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. <I>Dominenamine</I>.

Bully about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe

betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst

sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on him

like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn: burst

sideways.



<P>-- <I>Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine</I>.



<P>Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem mass.

Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist. Chilly

place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the

gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toad too.

What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air of the

place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an infernal lot of baa gas

round the place. Butchers for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks. Who

was telling me? Mervyn Brown. Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh's lovely

old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes

to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it rushes: blue. One whiff of that

and you're a goner.



<P>My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That's better.



<P>The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's

bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and

shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you

were before you rested. It's all written down: he has to do it.



<P>-- <I>Et ne nos inducas in tentationem</I>.



<P>The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would

be better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that of course.



<P>Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed

up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.

What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day

a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth,

men with beards, baldheaded business men, consumptive girls with little

sparrow's breasts. All the year round he prayed the same thing over them

all ad shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam now.



<P>-- <I>In paradisum</I>.



<P>Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over everybody.

Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.



<P>The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny

Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the

coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher

gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All followed

them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last, folding

his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground till the

coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal wheels ground the gravel

with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the barrow

along a lane of sepulchres.



<P>The ree the ra the Fee the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn't lilt here.



<P>-- The O'Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.



<P>Mr Power's soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.



<P>-- He's at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O'. But

his heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!



<P>-- Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I'Il soon be stretched

beside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.



<P>Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little

in his walk. Mr Power took his arm.



<P>-- She's better where she is, he said kindly.



<P>-- I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is

in heaven if there is a heaven.



<P>Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners

to plod by.



<P>-- Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.



<P>Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.



<P>-- The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we

can do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.



<P>They covered their heads.



<P>-- The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don't you think?

Mr Kernan said with reproof.



<P>Mr Bloom nodded gravely, looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret

eyes, secret searching eyes. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again.

We are the last. In the same boat. Hope he'll say something else.



<P>Mr Kernan added:



<P>-- The service of the Irish church, used in Mount Jerome, is simpler,

more impressive, I must say.



<P>Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.



<P>Mr Kernan said with solemnity:



<P>-- <I>I am the resurrection and the life</I>. That touches a man's inmost

heart.



<P>-- It does, Mr Bloom said.



<P>Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two

with his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections.

Broken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every

day. One fine day it gets bunged up and there you are. Lots of them lying

around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.

The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you are dead. That last

day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come forth, Lazarus!

And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last day! Then every fellow

mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps.

Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of powder in a skull.

Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.



<P>Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.



<P>-- Everything went off A 1, he said. What?



<P>He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman's shoulders. With

your tooraloom tooraloom.



<P>-- As it should be, Mr Kernan said.



<P>-- What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.



<P>Mr Kernan assured him.



<P>-- Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked.

I know his face.



<P>Ned Lambert glanced back.



<P>-- Bloom, he said, Madam Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.

She's his wife.



<P>-- O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven't seen her for some

time. She was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen

golden years ago, at Mat Dillon's, in Roundtown. And a good armful she

was.



<P>He looked behind through the others.



<P>-- What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn't he in the stationery

line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.



<P>Ned Lambert smiled.



<P>-- Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely's. A traveller for blottingpaper.



<P>-- In God's name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon

like that for? She had plenty of game in her then.



<P>-- Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.



<P>John Henry Menton's large eyes stared ahead.



<P>The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the

grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.



<P>-- John O'Connell, Mr Power said, pleased. He never forgets a friend.



<P>Mr O'Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:



<P>-- I am come to pay you another visit.



<P>-- My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don't want

your custom at all.



<P>Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham's

side, puzzling two keys at his back.



<P>-- Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?



<P>-- I did not, Martin Cunningham said.



<P>They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The

caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watch chain and spoke

in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.



<P>-- They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy

evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for Mulcahy

from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After traipsing about

in the fog they found the grave, sure enough. One of the drunks spelt out

the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking up at a statue

of our Saviour the widow had got put up.



<P>The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He resumed:



<P>-- And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, <I>Not a bloody bit

like the man</I>, says he. <I>That's not Mulcahy</I>, says he, <I>whoever

done it</I>.



<P>Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting

the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.



<P>-- That's all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.



<P>-- I know, Hynes said, I know that.



<P>-- To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It's pure goodheartedness:

damn the thing else.



<P>Mr Bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk. All want to be on

good terms with him. Decent fellow, John O'Connell, real good sort. Keys:

like Keyes's ad: no fear of anyone getting out, no passout checks. <I>Habeat

corpus</I>. I must see about that ad after the funeral. Did I write Ballsbridge

on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha?

Hope it's not chucked in the dead letter office. Be the better of a shave.

Grey sprouting beard. That's the first sign when the hairs come out grey

and temper getting cross. Silver threads among the grey. Fancy being his

wife. Wonder how he had the gumption to propose to any girl. Come out and

live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her. It might thrill her first.

Courting death... Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched

about. The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O'Connell

must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy

man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark. Will o'the

wisp. Gas of graves. Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all. Women

especially are so touchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep.

Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a pitchdark night. The

clock was on the stroke of twelve. Still they'd kiss all right if properly

keyed up. Whores in Turkish graveyards. Learn anything if taken young.

You might pick up a young widow here. Men like that. Love among the tombstones.

Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In the midst of death we are in life. Both ends

meet. Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell of frilled beefsteaks to the

starving gnawing their vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting to

do it at the window. Eight children he has anyway.



<P>He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field

after field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing. Sitting

or kneeling you couldn't. Standing? His head might come up some day above

ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed the ground

must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too, trim grass and edgings.

His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well so it is. Ought to be

flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce

the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic Gardens are just over there.

It's the blood sinking in the earth gives new life. Same idea those jews

they said killed the christian boy. Every man his price. Well preserved

fat corpse gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden. A bargain.

By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased,

three pounds thirteen and six. With thanks.



<P>I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpse manure, bones, flesh,

nails, charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink, decomposing. Rot

quick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a tallowy

kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, treacle oozing out of them.

Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever they are go

on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically. Nothing to feed on

feed on themselves.



<P>But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply

swirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little seaside

gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of power seeing

all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at life. Cracking his

jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one about the bulletin.

Spurgeon went to heaven 4 A.M. this morning. 11 P.M. (closing time). Not

arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear

an odd joke or the women to know what's in fashion. A juicy pear or ladies'

punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep out the damp. You must laugh sometimes

so better do it that way. Gravediggers in <I>Hamlet</I>. Shows the profound

knowledge of the human heart. Daren't joke about the dead for two years

at least. <I>De mortuis nil nisi prius</I>. Go out of mourning first. Hard

to imagine his funeral. Seems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary

notice they say you live longer. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.



<P>-- How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.



<P>-- Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.



<P>The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to

trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping

with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its

nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.



<P>Burying him. We come to bury Caesar. His ides of March or June. He doesn't

know who is here nor care.



<P>Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? Now

who is he I'd like to know? Now, I'd give a trifle to know who he is. Always

someone turns up you never dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome

all his life. Yes, he could. Still he'd have to get someone to sod him

after he died though he could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries.

No ants too. First thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe

was true to life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a Thursday

if you come to look at it.

<BLOCKQUOTE>O, poor Robinson Crusoe,

<BR>How could you possibly do so?</BLOCKQUOTE>

Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of them

all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could invent

a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding let it down that way. Ay but

they might object to be buried out of another fellow's. They're so particular.

Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from the holy land. Only a mother

and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin. I see what it means.

I see. To protect him as long as possible even in the earth. The Irishman's

house is his coffin. Enbalming in catacombs, mummies, the same idea.



<P>Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.

Twelve. I'm thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death's

number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn't in the chapel, that

I'll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.



<P>Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had

one like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he was

once. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey suit of

mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It's dyed. His wife I forgot he's not married

or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.



<P>The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the

gravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.



<P>Pause.



<P>If we were all suddenly somebody else.



<P>Far away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they

say. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.



<P>Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The

boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in

the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.

Well cut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.

Well it is a long rest. Feel no more. It's the moment you feel. Must be

damned unpleasant. Can't believe it at first. Mistake must be: someone

else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I haven't yet. Then darkened

deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Would you like to

see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all you hid all your

life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press his lower eyelid.

Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet

yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he's

doomed. Devil in that picture of sinner's death showing him a woman. Dying

to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of <I>Lucia. Shall I nevermore behold

thee?</I> Bam! expires. Gone at last. People talk about you a bit: forget

you. Don't forget to pray for him. Remember him in your prayers. Even Parnell.

Ivy day dying out. Then they follow: dropping into a hole one after the

other.



<P>We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you're well and

not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the

fire of purgatory.



<P>Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do

when you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy's warning.

Near you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma poor

mamma, and little Rudy.



<P>The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay

in on the coffin. Mr Bloom turned his face. And if he was alive all the

time? Whew! By Jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course.

Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have some law to pierce

the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin

and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of distress. Three days. Rather

long to keep them in summer. Just as well to get shut of them as soon as

you are sure there's no.



<P>The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.



<P>The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough

of it. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves

without show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its

way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground, he

traversed the dismal fields.



<P>Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he

knows them all. No: coming to me.



<P>-- I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is

your christian name? I'm not sure.



<P>-- L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M'Coy's name too.

He asked me to.



<P>Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the <I>Freeman</I> once.



<P>So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good

idea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know. He

died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads. Charley,

you're my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does no harm. I

saw to that, M'Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave him under an

obligation: costs nothing.



<P>-- And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was

over there in the.



<P>He looked around.



<P>-- Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?



<P>-- M'Intosh, Hynes said, scribbling, I don't know who he is. Is that

his name?



<P>He moved away, looking about him.



<P>-- No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!



<P>Didn't hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of

all the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good

Lord, what became of him?



<P>A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.



<P>-- O, excuse me!



<P>He stepped aside nimbly.



<P>Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.

A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their

spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped his wreath

against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The gravediggers put

on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. Then

knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One bent to pluck from the

haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with

shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing. Silently at the gravehead another

coiled the coffinband. His navelcord. The brother-in-law, turning away,

placed something in his free hand. Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble.

Headshake. I know that. For yourselves just.



<P>The mourners moved away slowly, without aim, by devious paths, staying

awhile to read a name on a tomb.



<P>-- Let us go round by the chief's grave, Hynes said. We have time.



<P>-- Let us, Mr Power said.



<P>They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr

Power's blank voice spoke:



<P>-- Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled

with stones. That one day he will come again.



<P>Hynes shook his head.



<P>-- Parnell will never come again, he said. He's there, all that was

mortal of him. Peace to his ashes.



<P>Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,

broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old

Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity

for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really?

Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot. Then lump them

together to save time. All souls' day. Twentyseventh I'll be at his grave.

Ten shillings for the gardener. He keeps it free of weeds. Old man himself.

Bent down double with his shears clipping. Near death's door. Who passed

away. Who departed this life. As if they did it of their own accord. Got

the shove, all of them. Who kicked the bucket. More interesting if they

told you what they were. So and so, wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino.

I paid five shillings in the pound. Or a woman's with her saucepan. I cooked

good Irish stew. Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem

of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest the protestants

put it. Old Dr Murren's. The great physician called him home. Well it's

God's acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly plastered and painted.

Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the <I>Church Times</I>. Marriage

ads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of

bronzefoil. Better value that for the money. Still, the flowers are more

poetical. The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses nothing.

Immortelles.



<P>A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the

wedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hu! Not a budge out of him. Knows

there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder. Silly-Milly

burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and

bits of broken chainies on the grave.



<P>The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve.



<P>Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.

Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased.

Why this infliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the

basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of

the boy. Apollo that was.



<P>How many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed.

As you are now so once were we.



<P>Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the

voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in

the house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather Kraahraark!

Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeragain hellohello amarawf

kopthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the

face. Otherwise you couldn't remember the face after fifteen years, say.

For instance who? For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom

Hely's.



<P>Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop.



<P>He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There

he goes.



<P>An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles.

An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey alive crushed

itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it. Good hidingplace

for treasure.



<P>Who lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet

was buried here by torchlight, wasn't he? Making his rounds.



<P>Tail gone now.



<P>One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones

clean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat gone

bad. Well and what's cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that <I>Voyages

in China</I> that the Chinese say a while man smells like a corpse. Cremation

better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the other firm. Wholesale

burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the plague. Quicklime fever pits

to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to ashes. Or bury at sea. Where is that

Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by birds. Earth, fire, water. Drowning they

say is the pleasantest. See your whole life in a flash. But being brought

back to life no. Can't bury in the air however. Out of a flying machine.

Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground

communication. We learned that from them. Wouldn't be surprised. Regular

square feed for them. Flies come before he's well dead. Got wind of Dignam.

They wouldn't care about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse:

smell, taste like raw white turnips.



<P>The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again. Enough

of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I was here

was Mrs Sinico's funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills. And even

scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of

to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores.

Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after death. You

will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after death. There

is another world after death named hell. I do not like that other world

she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel yet. Feel live

warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. They are not

going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.



<P>Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.



<P>Solicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton. John Henry, solicitor,

commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be In his office.

Mat Dillon's long ago. Jolly Mat convivial evenings. Cold fowl, cigars,

the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out

that evening on the bowling green because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke

of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate at first

sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing. Fellow

always like that, mortified if women are by.



<P>Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.



<P>-- Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.



<P>They stopped.



<P>-- Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said, pointing.



<P>John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.



<P>-- There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.



<P>John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed

the nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head again.



<P>-- It's all right now, Martin Cunningham said.



<P>John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.



<P>-- Thank you, he said shortly.



<P>They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind

a few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin could

wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger without his seeing it.



<P>Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.

Get the pull over him that way.



<P>Thank you. How grand we are this morning.

Nestor</H1></CENTER>

YOU, COCHRANE, WHAT CITY SENT FOR HIM?



<P>-- Tarentum, sir.



<P>-- Very good. Well?



<P>-- There was a battle, sir.



<P>-- Very good. Where?



<P>The boy's blank face asked the blank window.



<P>Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not

as memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake's wings

of excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry,

and time one livid final flame. What's left us then?



<P>-- I forgot the place, sir. 279 B.C.



<P>-- Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred

book.



<P>-- Yes, sir. And he said: <I>Another victory like that and we are done

for</I>.



<P>That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From

a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned

upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.



<P>-- You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?



<P>-- End of Pyrrhus, sir?



<P>-- I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.



<P>-- Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?



<P>A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong's satchel. He curled them

between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to

the tissues of his lips. A sweetened boy's breath. Welloff people, proud

that their eldest son was in the navy. Vico Road, Dalkey.



<P>-- Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.



<P>All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round

at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh more

loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.



<P>-- Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy's shoulder with the book,

what is a pier.



<P>-- A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the waves. A kind of

bridge. Kingstown pier, sir.



<P>Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench

whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. All.

With envy he watched their faces. Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their likes:

their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering

in the struggle.



<P>-- Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge. The words

troubled their gaze.



<P>-- How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.



<P>For Haines's chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild

drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A jester

at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement

master's praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly for the

smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other too often

heard, their land a pawnshop.



<P>Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam's hand in Argos or Julius Caesar

not been knifed to death? They are not to be thought away. Time has branded

them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities

they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing that they never

were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? Weave, weaver of the

wind.



<P>-- Tell us a story, sir.



<P>-- Oh, do, sir, a ghoststory.



<P>-- Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.



<P>-- <I>Weep no more</I>, Comyn said.



<P>-- Go on then, Talbot.



<P>-- And the history, sir?



<P>-- After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.



<P>A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork

of his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:

<BLOCKQUOTE>-- Weep no more, woful shepherd, weep no more

<BR>For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,

<BR>Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor...</BLOCKQUOTE>

It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible. Aristotle's

phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the

studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered

from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow a delicate Siamese

conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps,

impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind's darkness a sloth

of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly

folds. Thought is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul

is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquillity

sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.



<P>Talbot repeated:

<BLOCKQUOTE>-- Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,

<BR>Through the dear might...</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don't see anything.



<P>-- What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.



<P>His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again having

just remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these craven

hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer's heart and lips and on mine.

It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute. To

Caesar what is Caesar's, to God what is God's. A long look from dark eyes,

a riddling sentence to be woven on the church's looms. Ay.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.

<BR>My father gave me seeds to sow.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.



<P>-- Have I heard all? Stephen asked.



<P>-- Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.



<P>-- Half day, sir. Thursday.



<P>-- Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.



<P>They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling. Crowding

together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily:



<P>-- A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.



<P>-- O, ask me, sir.



<P>-- A hard one, sir.



<P>-- This is the riddle, Stephen said.

<BLOCKQUOTE>The cock crew

<BR>The sky was blue:

<BR>The bells in heaven

<BR>Were striking eleven.

<BR>Tis time for this poor soul

<BR>To go to heaven.</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- What is that?



<P>-- What, sir?



<P>-- Again, sir. We didn't hear.



<P>Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence Cochrane

said:



<P>-- What is it, sir? We give it up.



<P>Stephen, his throat itching, answered:



<P>-- The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.



<P>He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries

echoed dismay.



<P>A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:



<P>-- Hockey!



<P>They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly

they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour

of their boots and tongues.



<P>Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open

copybook. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness

and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his cheek,

dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp

as a snail's bed.



<P>He held out his copybook. The word Sums was written on the headline.

Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind

loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.



<P>-- Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them

to you, sir.



<P>Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.



<P>-- Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.



<P>-- Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was

to copy them off the board, sir.



<P>-- Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.



<P>-- No, sir.



<P>Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail's

bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.

But for her the race of the world would have trampled him under foot, a

squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery blood drained from

her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in life? His mother's

prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode. She was no more:

the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood

and wetted ashes. She had saved him from being trampled under foot and

had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath

beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless

bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened,

scraped and scraped.



<P>Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by algebra

that Shakespeare's ghost is Hamlet's grandfather. Sargent peered askance

through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the

hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.



<P>Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of

their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands, traverse,

bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from the world,

Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing

in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining

in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.



<P>-- Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?



<P>-- Yes, sir.



<P>In long shady strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a

word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue

of shame flickering behind his dull skin. <I>Amor matris</I>: subjective

and objective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed

him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.



<P>Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My childhood

bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly. Mine

is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark

palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants willing

to be dethroned.



<P>The sum was done.



<P>-- It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.



<P>-- Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.



<P>He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his

copybook back to his desk.



<P>-- You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said

as he followed towards the door the boy's graceless form.



<P>-- Yes, sir.



<P>In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.



<P>-- Sargent!



<P>-- Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.



<P>He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy

field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and

Mr Deasy came stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When he

had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He turned

his angry white moustache.



<P>-- What is it now? he cried continually without listening.



<P>-- Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen cried.



<P>-- Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore

order here.



<P>And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man's voice

cried sternly:



<P>-- What is the matter? What is it now?



<P>Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed

round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.



<P>Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather

of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. As it was

in the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base

treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their spooncase of purple

plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles:

world without end.



<P>A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his

rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.



<P>-- First, our little financial settlement, he said.



<P>He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It

slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid

them carefully on the table.



<P>-- Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.



<P>And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen's embarrassed hand moved

over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money, cowries

and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir's turban, and this, the

scallop of Saint James. An old pilgrim's hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.



<P>A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.



<P>-- Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his

hand. These are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This

is for shillings, sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.



<P>He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.



<P>-- Three twelve, he said. I think you'll find that's right.



<P>-- Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy

haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.



<P>-- No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.



<P>Stephen's hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols

too of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket. Symbols soiled by greed

and misery.



<P>-- Don't carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You'll pull it out somewhere

and lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You'll find them very

handy.



<P>Answer something.



<P>-- Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.



<P>The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times

now. Three nooses round me here. Well. I can break them in this instant

if I will.



<P>-- Because you don't save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don't

know yet what money is. Money is power, when you have lived as long as

I have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say?

<I>Put but money in thy purse</I>.



<P>-- Iago, Stephen murmured.



<P>He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man's stare.



<P>-- He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet but

an Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you

know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman's

mouth?



<P>The seas' ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: history is

to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.



<P>-- That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.



<P>-- Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That's not English. A French Celt said that.

He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.



<P>-- I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. <I>I

paid my way</I>.



<P>Good man, good man.



<P>-- <I>I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life</I>. Can

you feel that? <I>I owe nothing</I>. Can you?



<P>Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.

Curran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings. Temple,

two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds,

half a guinea, Kohler, three guineas, Mrs McKernan, five weeks' board.

The lump I have is useless.



<P>-- For the moment, no, Stephen answered.



<P>Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.



<P>-- I knew you couldn't, he said joyously. But one day you must feel

it. We are a generous people but we must also be just.



<P>-- I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.



<P>Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the

shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, Prince of Wales.



<P>-- You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.

I saw three generations since O'Connell's time. I remember the famine.

Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty

years before O'Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced

him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.



<P>Glorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh

the splendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed,

the planters' covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie

down.



<P>Stephen sketched a brief gesture.



<P>-- I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side.

But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We

are all Irish, all kings' sons.



<P>-- Alas, Stephen said.



<P>-- <I>Per vias rectas</I>, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted

for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down

to do so.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Lal the ral the ra

<BR>The rocky road to Dublin.</BLOCKQUOTE>

A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John. Soft

day, your honour... Day... Day... Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin.

Lal the ral the ra, lal the ral the raddy.



<P>-- That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,

with some of your literary friends: I have a letter here for the press.

Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.



<P>He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read

off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.



<P>-- Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, <I>the dictates of

common sense</I>. Just a moment.



<P>He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow

and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,

some times blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.



<P>Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed

around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek

heads poised in air: lord Hastings' Repulse, the duke of Westminster's

Shotover, the duke of Beaufort's Ceylon, <I>prix de Paris</I>, 1866. Elfin

riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their speeds, backing King's

colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.



<P>-- Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. But prompt ventilation of this

important question...



<P>Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the

mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek

of the canteen, over the motley slush. Even money Fair Rebel: ten to one

the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the

vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher's dame,

nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.



<P>Shouts rang shrill from the boys' playfield and a whirring whistle.



<P>Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley,

the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother's darling who seems

to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.

Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain,

a shout of spear spikes baited with men's bloodied guts.



<P>-- Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.



<P>He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.



<P>-- I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It's about

the foot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two opinions

on the matter.



<P>May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of <I>laissez faire</I>

which so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old

industries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme. European

conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel.

The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of agriculture. Pardoned

a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who was no better than she

should be. To come to the point at issue.



<P>-- I don't mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.



<P>Foot and mouth disease. Known as Koch's preparation. Serum and virus.

Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor's horses at M&uuml;rzsteg,

lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price. Courteous

offer a fair trial, Dictates of common sense. Allimportant question. In

every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thanking you for the

hospitality of your columns.



<P>-- I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at

the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can

be cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly

treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They offer to come

over here. I am trying to work up influence with the department. Now I'm

going to try publicity. I am surrounded by difficulties, by... intrigues,

by... backstairs influence, by...



<P>He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.



<P>-- Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the

jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are the

signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nation's

vital strength. I have seen it Coming these years. As sure as we are standing

here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction. Old England

is dying.



<P>He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed

a broad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.



<P>-- Dying, he said, if not dead by now.

<BLOCKQUOTE>The harlot's cry from street to street

<BR>Shall weave old England's winding sheet.</BLOCKQUOTE>

His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which

he halted.



<P>-- A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew

or gentile, is he not?



<P>-- They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can

see the darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the

earth to this day.



<P>On the steps of the Paris Stock Exchange the goldskinned men quoting

prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabbles of geese. They swarmed loud, uncouth

about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats.

Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full slow

eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the

rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain patience

to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard heaped by the

roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew the years of wandering

and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.



<P>-- Who has not? Stephen said.



<P>-- What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.



<P>He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell sideways

open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.



<P>-- History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.



<P>From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.

What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?



<P>-- The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All history

moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.



<P>Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:



<P>-- That is God.



<P>Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!



<P>-- What? Mr Deasy asked.



<P>-- A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.



<P>Mr Deasy looked down and held for a while the wings of his nose tweaked

between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.



<P>-- I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors

and many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was

no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten

years the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the strangers

to our shore here, MacMurrough's wife and her leman O'Rourke, prince of

Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many failures but

not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the end of my days. But I will

fight for the right till the end.

<BLOCKQUOTE>For Ulster will fight

<BR>And Ulster will be right.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.



<P>-- Well, sir, he began.



<P>-- I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long

at this work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am

wrong.



<P>-- A learner rather, Stephen said.



<P>And here what will you learn more?



<P>Mr Deasy shook his head.



<P>-- Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the

great teacher.



<P>Stephen rustled the sheets again.



<P>-- As regards these, he began.



<P>-- Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them

published at once.



<P><I>Telegraph. Irish Homestead</I>.



<P>-- I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two editors

slightly.



<P>That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,

M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at the

City Arms Hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You see

if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?



<P>-- <I>The Evening Telegraph</I>...



<P>-- That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have

to answer that letter from my cousin.



<P>-- Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.

Thank you.



<P>-- Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.

I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.



<P>-- Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.



<P>He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,

hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. The

lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate; toothless

terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will dub me a new

name: the bullockbefriending bard.



<P>-- Mr Dedalus!



<P>Running after me. No more letters, I hope.



<P>-- Just one moment.



<P>-- Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.



<P>Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.



<P>-- I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour

of being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know

that? No. And do you know why?



<P>He frowned sternly on the bright air.



<P>-- Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.



<P>-- Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.



<P>A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling

chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted

arms waving to the air.



<P>-- She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he

stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That's why.



<P>On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung

spangles, dancing coins.

Telemachus</H1></CENTER>

STATELY, PLUMP BUCK MULLIGAN CAME FROM THE STAIRHEAD, bearing a bowl of

lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressing gown,

ungirdled, was sustained gently-behind him by the mild morning air. He

held the bowl aloft and intoned:



<P>-- <I>Introibo ad altare Dei</I>.



<P>Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called up coarsely:



<P>-- Come up, Kinch. Come up, you fearful jesuit.



<P>Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about

and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding country and the awaking

mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him

and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his

head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top

of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed

him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and

hued like pale oak.



<P>Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the

bowl smartly.



<P>-- Back to barracks, he said sternly.



<P>He added in a preacher's tone:



<P>-- For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul

and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment.

A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.



<P>He peered sideways up and gave a long low whistle of call, then paused

awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there

with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered through

the calm.



<P>-- Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off

the current, will you?



<P>He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering

about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and

sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.

A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.



<P>-- The mockery of it, he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek.



<P>He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,

laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily half

way and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped

his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks

and neck.



<P>Buck Mulligan's gay voice went on.



<P>-- My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has

a Hellenic ring, hasn't it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We

must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty

quid?



<P>He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:



<P>-- Will he come? The jejune jesuit.



<P>Ceasing, he began to shave with care.



<P>-- Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.



<P>-- Yes, my love?



<P>-- How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?



<P>Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.



<P>-- God, isn't he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks

you're not a gentleman. God, these bloody English. Bursting with money

and indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus; you have

the real Oxford manner. He can't make you out. O, my name for you is the

best: Kinch, the knife-blade.



<P>He shaved warily over his chin.



<P>-- He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where

is his guncase?



<P>-- A woful lunatic, Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?



<P>-- I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the

dark with a man I don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting

a black panther. You saved men from drowning. I'm not a hero, however.

If he stays on here I am off.



<P>Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down

from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.



<P>-- Scutter, he cried thickly.



<P>He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen's upper

pocket, said:



<P>-- Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.



<P>Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a

dirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.

Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:



<P>-- The bard's noserag. A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.

You can almost taste it, can't you?



<P>He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair

oakpale hair stirring slightly.



<P>-- God, he said quietly. Isn't the sea what Algy calls it: a grey sweet

mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. <I>Epi oinopa ponton</I>.

Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks. I must teach you. You must read them in the original.

<I>Thalatta! Thalatta!</I> She is our great sweet mother. Come and look.



<P>Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked

down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbour mouth of Kingstown.



<P>-- Our mighty mother, Buck Mulligan said.



<P>He turned abruptly his great searching eyes from the sea to Stephen's

face.



<P>-- The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That's why she won't

let me have anything to do with you.



<P>-- Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.



<P>-- You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother

asked you, Buck Mulligan said. I'm hyperborean as much as you. But to think

of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray

for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you.



<P>He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant

smile curled his lips.



<P>-- But a lovely mummer, he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest

mummer of them all.



<P>He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.



<P>Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against

his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.

Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently, in

a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its

loose brown grave-clothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her

breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted

ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great

sweet mother by the well-fed voice beside him. The ring of bay and skyline

held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had stood beside

her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from

her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.



<P>Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.



<P>-- Ah, poor dogsbody, he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt

and few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?



<P>-- They fit well enough, Stephen answered.



<P>Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.



<P>-- The mockery of it, he said contentedly, secondleg they should be.

God knows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair

stripe, grey. You'll look spiffing in them. I'm not joking, Kinch. You

look damn well when you're dressed.



<P>-- Thanks, Stephen said. I can't wear them if they are grey.



<P>-- He can't wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror. Etiquette

is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can't wear grey trousers.



<P>He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the

smooth skin.



<P>Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its

smokeblue mobile eyes.



<P>-- That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,

says you have g.p.i. He's up in Dottyville with Conolly Norman. General

paralysis of the insane.



<P>He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad

in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and

the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong

wellknit trunk.



<P>-- Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard.



<P>Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft

by a crooked crack, hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this

face for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.



<P>-- I pinched it out of the skivvy's room, Buck Mulligan said. It does

her all right. The aunt always keeps plain-looking servants for Malachi.

Lead him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.



<P>Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen's peering eyes.



<P>-- The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.

If Wilde were only alive to see you.



<P>Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:



<P>-- It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a Buck Mulligan

suddenly linked his arm in Stephen's and walked with him round the tower,

his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.



<P>-- It's not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly.

God knows you have more spirit than any of them.



<P>Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.

The cold steelpen.



<P>-- Cracked lookingglass of a servant. Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs

and touch him for a guinea. He's stinking with money and thinks you're

not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus

or some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I could only work

together we might do something for the island. Hellenise it.



<P>Cranly's arm. His arm.



<P>-- And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I'm the only

one that knows what you are. Why don't you trust me more? What have you

up your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I'll

bring down Seymour and we'll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive

Kempthorpe.



<P>Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe's rooms. Palefaces:

they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another, O, I shall expire!

Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of

his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers

down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor's shears. A scared

calf's face gilded with marmalade. I don't want to be debagged! Don't you

play the giddy ox with me!



<P>Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf

gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold's face, pushes his mower

on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.



<P>To ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.



<P>-- Let him stay, Stephen said. There's nothing wrong with him except

at night.



<P>-- Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I'm

quite frank with you. What have you against me now?



<P>They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on

the water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly.



<P>-- Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.



<P>-- Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don't remember anything.



<P>He looked in Stephen's face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,

fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety

in his eyes.



<P>Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:



<P>-- Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother's

death?



<P>Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:



<P>-- What? Where? I can't remember anything. I remember only ideas and

sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?



<P>-- You were making tea, Stephen said, and I went across the landing

to get more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom.

She asked you who was in your room.



<P>-- Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.



<P>-- You said, Stephen answered, <I>O, it's only Dedalus whose mother

is beastly dead</I>.



<P>A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan's

cheek.



<P>-- Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?



<P>He shook his constraint from him nervously.



<P>-- And what is death, he asked, your mother's or yours or my own? You

saw only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and

Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissecting room. It's a beastly

thing and nothing else. It simply doesn't matter. You wouldn't kneel down

to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why? Because

you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it's injected the wrong

way. To me it's all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes are not functioning.

She calls the doctor Sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt.

Humour her till it's over. You crossed her last wish in death and yet you

sulk with me because I don't whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette's.

Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I didn't mean to offend the memory of your

mother.



<P>He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds

which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:



<P>-- I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.



<P>-- Of what, then? Buck Mulligan asked.



<P>-- Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.



<P>Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.



<P>-- O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.



<P>He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,

gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now grew

dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt

the fever of his cheeks.



<P>A voice within the tower called loudly:



<P>-- Are you up there, Mulligan?



<P>-- I'm coming, Buck Mulligan answered.



<P>He turned towards Stephen and said:



<P>-- Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola,

Kinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.



<P>His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level

with the roof.



<P>-- Don't mope over it all day, he said. I'm inconsequent. Give up the

moody brooding.



<P>His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of

the stairhead:

<BLOCKQUOTE>And no more turn aside and brood

<BR>Upon love's bitter mystery

<BR>For Fergus rules the brazen cars.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead

seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened,

spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the dim sea. The twining

stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the harpstrings merging their twining

chords. Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.



<P>A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, shadowing the bay in deeper green.

It lay behind him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus' song: I sang it alone

in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her door was open: she

wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside.

She was crying in her wretched bed. For those words, Stephen: love's bitter

mystery.



<P>Where now?



<P>Her secrets: old feather fans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,

a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny

window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing in the

pantomime of Turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang:

<BLOCKQUOTE>I am the boy

<BR>That can enjoy

<BR>Invisibility.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>And no more turn aside and brood</BLOCKQUOTE>

Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his brooding

brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached

the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her

at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely fingernails reddened by

the blood of squashed lice from the children's shirts.



<P>In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its

loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath

bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.



<P>Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On

me alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured

face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their

knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. <I>Liliata rutilantium te confessorum

turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat</I>.



<P>Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!



<P>No mother. Let me be and let me live.



<P>-- Kinch ahoy!



<P>Buck Mulligan's voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up

the staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul's cry,

heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.



<P>-- Dedalus, comedown, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines

is apologizing for waking us last night. It's all right.



<P>-- I'm coming, Stephen said, turning.



<P>-- Do, for Jesus' sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all

our sakes.



<P>His head disappeared and reappeared.



<P>-- I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it's very clever. Touch

him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.



<P>-- I get paid this morning, Stephen said.



<P>-- The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us

one.



<P>-- If you want it, Stephen said.



<P>-- Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We'll

have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent sovereigns.



<P>He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out

of tune with a Cockney accent:

<BLOCKQUOTE>O, won't we have a merry time

<BR>Drinking whisky, beer and wine,

<BR>On coronation,

<BR>Coronation day?

<BR>O, won't we have a merry time

<BR>On coronation day?</BLOCKQUOTE>

Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shaving-bowl shone, forgotten,

on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there all day,

forgotten friendship?



<P>He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,

smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.

So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and

yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.



<P>In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan's gowned form

moved briskly about the hearth to and fro, hiding and revealing its yellow

glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the

high barbicans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and

fumes of fried grease floated, turning.



<P>-- We'll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will

you?



<P>Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from

the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open

the inner doors.



<P>-- Have you the key? a voice asked.



<P>-- Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I'm choked. He howled

without looking up from the fire:



<P>-- Kinch!



<P>-- It's in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.



<P>The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been

set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the doorway,

looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down

to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. Then he

carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily

and sighed with relief.



<P>-- I'm melting, he said, as the candle remarked when .



<P>But hush. Not a word more on that subject. Kinch, wake up. Bread, butter,

honey. Haines, come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these

thy gifts. Where's the sugar? O, jay, there's no milk.



<P>Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from

the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.



<P>-- What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.



<P>-- We can drink it black, Stephen said. There's a lemon in the locker.



<P>-- O, damn you and your Paris fads, Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove

milk.



<P>Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:



<P>-- That woman is coming up with the milk.



<P>-- The blessings of God on you, Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from

his chair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here,

I can't go fumbling at the damned eggs. He hacked through the fry on the

dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying:



<P>-- <I>In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti</I>.



<P>Haines sat down to pour out the tea.



<P>-- I'm giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you

do make strong tea, don't you?



<P>Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman's

wheedling voice:



<P>-- When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when

I makes water I makes water.



<P>-- By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.



<P>Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:



<P>-- <I>So I do, Mrs Cahill</I>, says she. <I>Begob, ma'am</I>, says Mrs

Cahill, <I>God send you don't make them in the one pot</I>.



<P>He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled

on his knife.



<P>-- That's folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five

lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of

Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.



<P>He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his

brows:



<P>-- Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan's tea and water pot spoken

of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?



<P>-- I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.



<P>-- Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?



<P>-- I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the

Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.



<P>Buck Mulligan's face smiled with delight.



<P>-- Charming, he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth

and blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming.



<P>Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened

rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:

<BLOCKQUOTE>-- For old Mary Ann

<BR>She doesn't care a damn,

<BR>But, hising up her petticoats...</BLOCKQUOTE>

He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.



<P>The doorway was darkened by an entering form.



<P>-- The milk, sir.



<P>-- Come in, ma'am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.



<P>An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen's elbow.



<P>-- That's a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.



<P>-- To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure. Stephen

reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.



<P>-- The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently

of the collector of prepuces.



<P>-- How much, sir? asked the old woman.



<P>-- A quart, Stephen said.



<P>He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white

milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a

tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger.

She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. Crouching by a patient

cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled

fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed about her whom they knew,

dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in

old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror

and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret

morning. To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned

to beg her favour.



<P>-- It is indeed, ma'am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their

cups.



<P>-- Taste it, sir, she said.



<P>He drank at her bidding.



<P>-- If we could only live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat

loudly, we wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.

Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust,

horsedung and consumptives' spits.



<P>-- Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.



<P>-- I am, ma'am, Buck Mulligan answered.



<P>Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice

that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman; me she slights.

To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her

but her woman's unclean loins, of man's flesh made not in God's likeness,

the serpent's prey. And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with

wondering unsteady eyes.



<P>-- Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.



<P>-- Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.



<P>Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.



<P>-- Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?



<P>-- I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from

west, sir?



<P>-- I am an Englishman, Haines answered.



<P>-- He's English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak

Irish in Ireland.



<P>-- Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I'm ashamed I don't speak

the language myself. I'm told it's a grand language by them that knows.



<P>-- Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely.

Fill us out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma'am?



<P>-- No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the

milkcan on her forearm and about to go.



<P>Haines said to her:



<P>-- Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn't we?



<P>Stephen filled the three cups.



<P>-- Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it's seven mornings a pint at

twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three

mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling and one and

two is two and two, sir.



<P>Buck Mulligan sighed and having filled his mouth with a crust thickly

buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his

trouser pockets.



<P>-- Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him smiling.



<P>Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the

thick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in

his fingers and cried:



<P>-- A miracle!



<P>He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:



<P>-- Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give. Stephen

laid the coin in her uneager hand.



<P>-- We'll owe twopence, he said.



<P>-- Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning,

sir.



<P>She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan's tender chant:

<BLOCKQUOTE>-- Heart of my heart, were it more,

<BR>More would be laid at your feet.</BLOCKQUOTE>

He turned to Stephen and said:



<P>-- Seriously, Dedalus. I'm stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring

us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland expects

that every man this day will do his duty.



<P>-- That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national

library today.



<P>-- Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.



<P>He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:



<P>-- Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?



<P>Then he said to Haines:



<P>-- The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.



<P>-- All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey

trickle over a slice of the loaf.



<P>Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the

loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:



<P>-- I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.



<P>Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit. Conscience.

Yet here's a spot.



<P>-- That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol

of Irish art is deuced good.



<P>Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen's foot under the table and said with warmth

of tone:



<P>-- Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.



<P>-- Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just

thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.



<P>-- Would I make money by it? Stephen asked.



<P>Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of

the hammock, said:



<P>-- I don't know, I'm sure.



<P>He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen

and said with coarse vigour:



<P>-- You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?



<P>-- Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From

the milkwoman or from him. It's a toss up, I think.



<P>I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along

with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.



<P>-- I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.



<P>Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen's arm.



<P>-- From me, Kinch, he said.



<P>In a suddenly changed tone he added:



<P>-- To tell you the God's truth I think you're right. Damn all else they

are good for. Why don't you play them as I do? To hell with them all. Let

us get out of the kip.



<P>He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying

resignedly:



<P>-- Mulligan is stripped of his garments.



<P>He emptied his pockets on to the table.



<P>-- There's your snotrag, he said.



<P>And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie, he spoke to them,

chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and rummaged

in his trunk while he called for - a clean handkerchief. Agenbite of inwit.

God, we'll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green

boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict

myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of his talking

hands.



<P>-- And there's your Latin quarter hat, he said.



<P>Stephen picked it up and put it on: Haines called to them from the doorway:



<P>-- Are you coming, you fellows?



<P>-- I'm ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,

Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out with

grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:



<P>-- And going forth he met Butterly.



<P>Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out

and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked

it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.



<P>At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:



<P>-- Did you bring the key?



<P>-- I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.



<P>He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy

bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.



<P>-- Down, sir. How dare you, sir? Haines asked:



<P>-- Do you pay rent for this tower?



<P>-- Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.



<P>-- To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.



<P>They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:



<P>-- Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?



<P>-- Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were

on the sea. But ours is the <I>omphalos</I>.



<P>-- What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.



<P>-- No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I'm not equal to Thomas Aquinas

and the fiftyfive reasons he has made to prop it up. Wait till I have a

few pints in me first.



<P>He turned to Stephen, saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his

primrose waistcoat:



<P>-- You couldn't manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?



<P>-- It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.



<P>-- You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?



<P>-- Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.

It's quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet's grandson is Shakespeare's

grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.



<P>-- What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?



<P>Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending

in loose laughter, said to Stephen's ear:



<P>-- O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!



<P>-- We're always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it

is rather long to tell.



<P>Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.



<P>-- The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.



<P>-- I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this

tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. <I>That beetles

o'er his base into the sea</I>, isn't it?



<P>Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did

not speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap

dusty mourning between their gay attires.



<P>-- It's a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.



<P>Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.

The seas' ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume

of the mailboat, vague on the bright skyline, and a sail tacking by the

Muglins.



<P>-- I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.

The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.



<P>Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked

at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had

suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved

a doll's head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began

to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:

<BLOCKQUOTE>-- I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.

<BR>My mother's a jew, my father's a bird.

<BR>With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree,

<BR>So here's to disciples and Calvary.</BLOCKQUOTE>

He held up a forefinger of warning.

<BLOCKQUOTE>-- If anyone thinks that I amn't divine

<BR>He'll get no free drinks when I'm making the wine

<BR>But have to drink water and wish it were plain

<BR>That I make when the wine becomes water again.</BLOCKQUOTE>

He tugged swiftly at Stephen's ashplant in farewell and, running forward

to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings

of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:

<BLOCKQUOTE>-- Goodbye, now, goodbye. Write down all I said

<BR>And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.

<BR>What's bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly

<BR>And Olivet's breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye.</BLOCKQUOTE>

He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his

winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury's hat quivering in the fresh wind

that bore back to them his brief birdlike cries.



<P>Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and

said:



<P>-- We oughtn't to laugh, I suppose. He's rather blasphemous. I'm not

a believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out

of it somehow, doesn't it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?



<P>-- The ballad of Joking Jesus, Stephen answered.



<P>-- O, Haines said, you have heard it before?



<P>-- Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.



<P>-- You're not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer

in the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and

a personal God.



<P>-- There's only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.



<P>Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a

green stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.



<P>-- Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.



<P>Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his

sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang

it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards

Stephen in the shell of his hands.



<P>-- Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe

or you don't, isn't it? Personally I couldn't stomach that idea of a personal

God. You don't stand for that, I suppose?



<P>-- You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible

example of free thought.



<P>He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his

side. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.

My familiar, after me, calling Steeeeeeeeeephen. A wavering line along

the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. He wants

that key. It is mine, I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt bread. Give him

the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his eyes.



<P>-- After all, Haines began...



<P>Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was

not all unkind.



<P>-- After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are

your own master, it seems to me.



<P>-- I am the servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an

Italian.



<P>-- Italian? Haines said.



<P>A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.



<P>-- And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.



<P>-- Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?



<P>-- The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising,

and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.



<P>Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.



<P>-- I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think

like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather

unfairly. It seems history is to blame.



<P>The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen's memory the triumph of

their brazen bells: <I>et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam</I>:

the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts,

a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus,

the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their

chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her

heresiarchs. A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and

the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life

long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine,

spurning Christ's terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius

who held that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken

a moment since in mockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The void awaits

surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting

from those embattled angels of the church, Michael's host, who defend her

ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.



<P>Hear, hear. Prolonged applause. <I>Zut! Nom de Dieu!</I>



<P>-- Of course I'm a Britisher, Haines' voice said, and I feel as one.

I don't want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.

That's our national problem, I'm afraid, just now.



<P>Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.



<P>-- She's making for Bullock harbour.



<P>The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.



<P>-- There's five fathoms out there, he said. It'll be swept up that way

when the tide comes in about one. It's nine days today.



<P>The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting

for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, salt

white. Here I am.



<P>They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood

on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.

A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him moved slowly frogwise his

green legs in the deep jelly of the water.



<P>-- Is the brother with you, Malachi?



<P>-- Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.



<P>-- Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young

thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.



<P>-- Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.



<P>Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near

the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones, water

glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over

his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.



<P>Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines

and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips

and breastbone.



<P>-- Seymour's back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur

of rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.



<P>-- Ah, go to God, Buck Mulligan said.



<P>-- Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?



<P>-- Yes.



<P>-- Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with

money.



<P>-- Is she up the pole?



<P>-- Better ask Seymour that.



<P>-- Seymour a bleeding officer, Buck Mulligan said.



<P>He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying

tritely:



<P>-- Redheaded women buck like goats.



<P>He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.



<P>-- My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I'm the <I>Uebermensch</I>. Toothless

Kinch and I, the supermen.



<P>He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes

lay.



<P>-- Are you going in here, Malachi?



<P>-- Yes. Make room in !he bed.



<P>The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached

the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a

stone, smoking.



<P>-- Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.



<P>-- Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast. Stephen turned away.



<P>-- I'm going, Mulligan, he said.



<P>-- Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.



<P>Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped

clothes.



<P>-- And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.



<P>Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck

Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:



<P>-- He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake Zarathustra.



<P>His plump body plunged.



<P>-- We'll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the

path and smiling at wild Irish.



<P>Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.



<P>-- The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.



<P>-- Good, Stephen said.



<P>He walked along the upwardcurving path.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Liliata rutilantium.

<BR>Turnia circumdet.

<BR>Iubilantium te virginum</BLOCKQUOTE>

The priest's grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will

not sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.



<P>A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning

the curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a seal's,

far out on the water, round.



<P>Usurper.

<P>Universally that person's acumen is esteemed very little perceptive

concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitable by mortals

with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most

in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind's

ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent

they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour

is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure

of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for

that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent

when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature's

incorrupted benefaction. For who is there who anything of some significance

has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the

surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone

so is there inilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature's boon can

contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen

to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble

lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might

be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund

habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted

customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively

who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence

can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously

command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or

with diminution's menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function

ever irrevocably enjoined?



<P>It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate,

among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired,

the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured. Not to speak of hostels,

leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the

O'Shiels, the O'Hickeys, the O'Lees, have sedulously set down the divers

methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the

malady had been trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux. Certainly

in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation

should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them

adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience

it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent

inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby

maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever

care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and

not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently

moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and

for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.



<P>To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be

molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers

prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods

mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so having

itself, parturient in vehicle the reward carrying desire immense among

all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile.

O thing of prudent nation not merely in being seen but also even in being

related worthy of being praised that they her by anticipation went seeing

mother, that she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been

begun she felt!



<P>Before born babe bliss had. Within womb won he worship. Whatever in

that one case done commodiously done was. A couch by midwives attended

with wholesome food reposeful cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing

were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs

there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case

not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes

by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human,

the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or

eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when,

ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie

in, her term up.



<P>Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night's oncoming.

Of Israel's folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark

ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.



<P>Of that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming

mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale

so God's angel to Mary quoth. Watchers they there walk, white sisters in

ward sleepless. Smarts they still sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice

an hundred. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest

ward.



<P>In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mild-hearted eft rising

with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping lightens

in eyeblink Ireland's westward welkin! Full she dread that God the Wreaker

all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins. Christ's rood made

she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch.

That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne's house.



<P>Loth to irk in Horne's hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow

he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land

and seafloor nine year had long outwandered. Once her in townhithe meeting

he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he craved with good ground

of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had

looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.



<P>As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad

after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O'Hare Doctor tidings

sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O'Hare

Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied

in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young,

algate sore unwilling God's rightwiseness to withsay. She said that he

had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven,

holy housel and sick men's oil to his limbs. The man then right earnest

asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered

him and said that he was died in Mona island through bellycrab three year

agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his

dear soul in his undeathliness. He heard her sad words, in held hat sad

staring. So stood they there both awhile in wanhope, sorrowing one with

other.



<P>Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the

dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked

forth from his mother's womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for

to go as he came.



<P>The man that was come into the house then spoke to the nursingwoman

and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.

The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now

full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that

now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she had seen many births

of women but never was none so hard as was that woman's birth. Then she

set it forth all to him that time was had lived nigh that house. The man

hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women's woe in the travail

that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was

a young face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a

handmaid. Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.



<P>And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed

them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there came against

the place as they stood a young learning knight yclept Dixon. And the traveller

Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each

with other in the house of misericord where this learning knight lay by

cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded

in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten

him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much

as he might suffice. And he said now that he should go into that castle

for to make merry with them that were there. And the traveller Leopold

said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtle.

Also the lady was of his avis and reproved the learning knight though she

trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.

But the learning knight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne

have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous

castle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him

for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers

lands and sometimes venery.



<P>And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy

and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move

for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and knives that

are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that

they fix in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously.

And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand

and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blares into them like

to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight

could devise a fuller ne richer. And there was a vat of silver that was

moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads

though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see

it natheless they are so. And these fishes lie in an oily water brought

there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to

the juices of the olive press. And also it was marvel to see in that castle

how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheat kidneys out of Chaldee

that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do into it swells up wondrously

like to a vast mountain. And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves

up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents

they brew out a brewage like to mead.



<P>And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp

thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe

Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat

in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and

anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his

neighbour wist not of his wile. And he sat down in that castle with them

for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.



<P>This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at

the reverence of Jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for

there was above one quick with child a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.

Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that

it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not

come or now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware and saw a franklin

that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the

tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise

and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently. But, said

he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy

of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long. And the franklin that

had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next. Also he took the

cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring

of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed

as far as he might to their both's health for he was a passing good man

of his lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever

sat in scholars' hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that

ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight

of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him

courtly in the cup. Woman's woe with wonder pondering.



<P>Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to

be drunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side

the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable's

with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the

franklin that high! Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and

young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and

Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile

gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken

that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold. But

on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such

as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow. And sir Leopold

sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his

son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest

wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest

manner. Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.



<P>For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each

gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining

that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out

a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne's house that

now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her

death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). And they

said farther she should live because in the beginning they said the woman

should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination

affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her

die. And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world

was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people

believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy.

A redress God grant. This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim

nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die. In

colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what

for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour

them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack. Then young Madden

showed all the whole affair and when he said how that she was dead and

how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow

he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let

her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen

had these words following, Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both

babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other

in purge fire. But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we

nightly unpossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God,

Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. We are means

to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we. Then

said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends. But he had overmuch

drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest

a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to

be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa

sang young Malachi's praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium

he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their

jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint

Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay

in man to do. Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen

and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange

humour which he would not bewray and also ford that he rued for her that

bare whoso she might be or wheresoever. Then spoke young Stephen orgulous

of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons,

of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of

brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith,

by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she

lie with a woman which her man has but lain with <I>effectu secuto</I>,

or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses

Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul

was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God's

greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bring

forth beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman's

seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages

founded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like

case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A wariness of mind

he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling,

as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art

of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so

seldom seen an accident it was good for that Mother Church belike at one

blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their

questions. That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant

word. Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred

that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a

wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared

eftsoons.



<P>But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still

had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour

and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only

manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could

save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that

evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb's wool,

the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for

it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had

of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend's son and

was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was

that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of

real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for

that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with

whores.



<P>About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty

so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their

approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the

intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar

of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink we, quod he,

of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body

but my soul's bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by

bread alone. Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more

than the other will dismay. See ye here. And he showed them glistering

coins of the tribute and goldsmiths' notes the worth of two pound nineteen

shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ. They all admired

to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore. His

words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time's ruins

build eternity's mansions. What means this? Desire's wind blasts the thorntree

but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time.

Mark me now. In woman's womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the

maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.

This is the postcreation. <I>Omnis cam ad te veniet</I>. No question but

her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer

and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith

aptly that she hath an <I>omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem</I>, that is

to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she

won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we

are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all,

seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin. But here is the matter

now. Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature,

<I>vergine madre figlia di tuo figlio</I> or she knew him not and then

stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives

in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the Joiner patron of the happy

demise of all unhappy marriages <I>parce que M. L&eacute;o Taxil nous a

dit que qui l'avait mise dans cette fichue position c'&eacute;tait le sacr&eacute;

pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder</I> transsubstantiality <I>oder</I> consubstantiality

but in no case subsubstantiality. And all cried out upon It for a very

scurvy word. A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a

body without blemish, a belly without bigness. Let the lewd with faith

and fervour worship. With will will we withstand, withsay.



<P>Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would

sing a bawdy catch <I>Staboo Stabella</I> about a wench that was put in

pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did now attack: <I>The first

three months she was not well, Staboo</I>, when here nurse Quigley from

the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet

as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord

Andrew came for because she was jealous that not gasteful turmoil might

shorten the honour of her guard. It was an ancient and a sad matron of

a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims

and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently

Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with

civil rudeness some and with menace of blandishments others whiles all

chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at,

thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in the peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling,

thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his

drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold

that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising

also the time's occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred.

In Horne's house rest should reign.



<P>To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in

Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he

had not cided to take friar's vows and he answered him obedience in the

womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master

Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds

and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue

of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed

it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he said very entirely

it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever

virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his

curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as

the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron,

her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed

while clerks sung kyries and the anthem <I>Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis

mysterium</I> till she was there unmaided. He gave them then a much admirable

hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis

Beaumont that is in their <I>Maid's Tragedy</I> that was writ for a like

twining of lovers: <I>To bed, to bed</I>, was the burden of it to be played

with accompanable concent upon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet epithalame

of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous

flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium

of connubial communion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but,

harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by

my truth, of such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen said indeed

to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she

of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high

in those days and the custom of the country approved with it. Greater love

than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.

Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words to that effect, said Zarathustra,

sometime regius professor of French letters to the university of Oxtail

nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden. Bring

a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest

bed. <I>Orate, fratres, pro memetipso</I>. And all the people shall say,

Amen. Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst

little by me and by my word and broughtest in a stranger to my gates to

commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Therefore

hast thou sinned against the light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the

slave of servants. Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian.

Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me

for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and the Indian

of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth

now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo

and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk

and money. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my

sun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast left me alone for ever in

the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed

my mouth. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not

been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for

the Orient from on high which brake hell's gates visited a darkness that

was foraneous. Assuefaction minorates atrocities (as Tully saith of his

darling Stoics) and Hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of

combustion. The adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt's plague which

in the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper <I>ubi</I>

and <I>quomodo</I>. And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord

in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same

multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing

by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the

final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being.

The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp,

sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend. First saved from water of

old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity

of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat

and the ossifrage. And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to

what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to

Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from

what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his

whenceness.



<P>Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly <I>Etienne chanson</I> but

he loudly bid them lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic

longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator all in applepie

order, a penny for him who finds the pea.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack,

<BR>See the malt stored in many a refluent sack,

<BR>In the proud cirque of Jackjohn's bivouac.</BLOCKQUOTE>

A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled, back. Loud on

left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the storm

that hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and

witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. And

he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed pale as they might all

mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift

was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage

of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some mock

and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master

Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow

on any the least colour. But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy

was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind

his lead. But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched

in Horne's hall. He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of

any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that

Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon

that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart's side spoke to him

calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other

thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the

thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural

phenomenon.



<P>But was young Boasthard's fear vanquished by Calmer's words? No, for

he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be

done away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the

other? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But

could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle

Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed not for Grace was not there

to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth

or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard? Why, he could not

but hear unless he had plugged up the tube Understanding (which he had

not done). For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon

where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing

show. And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away? By no

means would he and make more shows according as men do with wives which

Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law. Then wotted he nought

of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise

which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there

is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall

come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and

Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he

fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she

said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true

path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn

aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly

that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some

learned, Carnal Concupiscence.



<P>This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse

of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in-the-Hand

(which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would

strain the last but they would make at her and know her. For regarding

Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive

no thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was

the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four

tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and

Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and

the monsters they cared not for them, for Preservative had given them a

stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither

from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield

which was named Killchild. So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil

and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon,

Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretched company, were

ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous

rage that he would presently lift his arm and spill their souls for their

abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which

forth to bring brenningly biddeth.



<P>So Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy

and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water

a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won't sprout, fields

athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.

Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle

this long while back as no man remembered to be without. The rosy buds

all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flags

and faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world saying, for aught

they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land

so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness. But by and by, as said,

this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen

clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up

at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock,

one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper

pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for

their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles

catched up soon as the pour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke's lawn,

thence through Merrion green up to Holles street, a swash of water running

that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about

but no more crack after that first. Over against the Rt. Hon. Mr Justice

Fitzgibbon's door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the college

lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman's gentleman that had but come from Mr

Moore's the writer's (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite)

chanced against Alec. Bannon in a cut bob (which are now In with dance

cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the

stage where his coz and Mal M's brother will stay a month yet till Saint

Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he

to Andrew Horne's being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said,

but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the

heel and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne's.

There Leop. Bloom of Crawford's journal sitting snug with a covey of wags,

likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy, Vin.

Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will. Madden, T. Lenehan, very sad for a racinghorse

he fancied and Stephen D. Leop. Bloom there for a languor he had but was

now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll

with red slippers on in pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those

in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through

pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her

term, the midwives sore put to it and can't deliver, she queasy for a bowl

of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very

heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks they say,

but God give her soon issue. 'Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and

Lady day bit off her last chick's nails that was then a twelvemonth and

with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in

the king's bible. Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the Sacrament

and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock

harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has

trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear. In sum

an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase

the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for

a prognostication of Malachi's almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has

done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his

farmer's gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without

bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found

in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.



<P>With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter

was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for

he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen's

persuasion he gave over to search and was bidden to sit near by which he

did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew

or honest pickle and what belonged of woman, horseflesh, or hot scandal

he had it pat. To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most

part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers,

bookies, Paul's men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio

and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff

often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets

much loose gossip. He took his ordinary at a boiling-cook's and if he had

but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with

a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue,

some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother's son of

them would burst their sides. The other, Costello, that is, hearing this

talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was

his name), 'tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of

the plague. But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their

bully beef, a pox on it. There's as good fish in this tin as ever came

out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that

stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which

was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset. <I>Mort

aux vaches</I>, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured

to a brandy shipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French

like a gentleman too. From a child this Frank had been a donought that

his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his

letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study

the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and

was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his

volumes. One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher,

then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then

he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the Romany folk,

kidnapping a squire's heir by favour or moonlight or fecking maid's linen

or choking chickens behind a hedge. He had been off as many times as a

cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father

the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. What,

says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift

of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but this day morning

going to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce believe 'tis so bad,

says he. And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers,

greasy hoggets and wether wools, having been some years before actuary

for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live

stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low's yard in Prussia street.

I question with you there, says he. More like 'tis the hoose of the timber

tongue. Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely, told him no such

matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler

thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest,

the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic

to take the bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.

He'll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull

that's Irish, says he. Irish by name and Irish by nature, says Mr Stephen,

and he sent the ale purling about. An Irish bull in an English chinashop.

I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was sent to our

island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattle breeder of them all, with

an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table,

and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier

bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a coat of gold

and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of

our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging

his bulliness in daisychains. What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before

he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded

by a college of doctors, who were no better off than himself. So be off

now, says he, and do all my cousin german the Lord Harry tells you and

take a farmer's blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very

soundly. But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent,

for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid,

wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time

of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick

on the nape from his long holy tongue then lie with the finest strapping

young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his

word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with

a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock

and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him

at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay

in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart's content. By

this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown

so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our cozening

dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon

as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their

ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bull's language and

they all after him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would

suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for

that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a

hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the

lord Harry green is the grass that grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon,

if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara

or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard

or a bag of rapeseed out he run amok over half the countryside rooting

up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry's orders.

There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord

Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old

whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I'll meddle in his

matters, says he. I'll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help

of that good pizzle my father left me. But one evening, says Mr Dixon,

when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning

a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course

was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself

a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook

that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded

descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, <I>Bos Bovum</I>,

which is good bog Latin for boss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent,

the lord Harry put his head into a cow's drinking trough in the presence

of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name.

Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt

that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bull's

language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first

personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever

he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it up

on what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale

of cotton or a corkfloat. In short he and the bull of Ireland were soon

as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and

the end was that the men of the island, seeing no help was toward as the

ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves

and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned

the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind,

put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran

up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed

off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America. Which

was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that

rollicking chanty:

<BLOCKQUOTE>-- Pope Peter's but a pissabed.

<BR>A man's a man for a' that.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Our worthy acquaintance, Mr Malachi Mulligan, now appeared in the doorway

as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend

whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,

who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a

cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil

enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project

of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on. Whereat

he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had

printed that day at Mr Quinnell's bearing a legend printed in fair italics:

<I>Mr Malachi Mulligan, Fertiliser and Incubator, Lambay Island</I>. His

project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle

pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir

Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for

which our bodily organism has been framed. Well, let us hear of it, good

my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it smacks of wenching. Come,

be seated, both. 'Tis as cheap sitting as standing. Mr Mulligan accepted

of the invitation and, expatiating on his design, told his hearers that

he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility,

both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its

turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as

well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from

proclivities acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial

couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable

females with rich jointures, a prey for the vilest bonzes, who hide their

flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly

bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply

the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex

when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured

them, made his heart weep. To curb this inconvenience (which he concluded

due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors

of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in

fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord

Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of not much in favour with our ascendancy

party. He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named

<I>Omphalos</I> with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt

and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female

of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire

of fulfilling the functions of her natural. Money was no object, he said,

nor would he take a penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less

than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions, and their

tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their

man. For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively

upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of

these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose,

both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum

chillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration

Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had

shielded it. The both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for

all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr

Mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.

His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and

won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary's excepted to it,

asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.

Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from

the classics which as it dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and

tasteful support of his contention: <I>Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus

seculi, O quirites, ut matres familiarum nostro<oe> lascivas cujuslibet

semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus

centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt:</I> while for those of ruder

wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable

to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake

and duck.



<P>Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper

man of his person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with

animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics

while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced.

The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that

had befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour. Mr

Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and

fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray,

sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give? Who,

upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper

distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate

of Horne's house, that was in an interesting condition, poor lady, from

woman's woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness

had yet taken place. Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask Mr Mulligan

himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him,

betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb

or was due as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in

the stomach. For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls,

smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable

droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though

'tis pity she's a trollop): There's a belly that never bore a bastard.

This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storms of mirth and threw

the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. The spry rattle

had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.



<P>Here the listener, who was none other than the Scotch student, a little

fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion

with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point,

having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness

to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning

pose of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so

nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance

of the head, asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if

he might treat him with a cup of it. <I>Mais bien s&ucirc;r</I>, noble

stranger, said he cheerily, <I>et mille compliments</I>. That you may and

very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.

But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful

of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my

heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above

for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things. With these

words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of

the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket

that hung from a silk riband that very picture which he had cherished ever

since her hand had wrote therein. Gazing upon those features with a world

of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with

these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new

coquette cap (a gift for her feast day as she told me) in such an artless

disorder, of so melting a tenderness, 'pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur,

had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the

hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was

never so touched in all my life. God I thank thee as the Author of my days!

Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her

favours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having

replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. Beneficent

Disseminator of blessing to all Thy creatures, how great and universal

must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free

and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the

heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years. But indeed,

sir, I wander from the point. How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary

joys! Maledicity! Would to God that foresight had remembered me to take

my cloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured

seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me,

he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and,

thousand thunders, I know of a <I>marchand de capotes</I>, Monsieur Poyntz,

from whom I can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the French fashion

as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, Tut! cries le F&eacute;condateur,

tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller

(I have just cracked a half bottle <I>avec lui</I> in a circle of the best

wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, <I>ventre biche</I>,

they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. A

drenching of that violence, he tells me, <I>sans blague</I>, has sent more

than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world. Pooh!

A <I>livre!</I> cries Monsieur Lynch. The clumsy things are dear at a sou.

One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such

stopgaps. No woman of any wit would wear one. My dear Kitty told me today

that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an

ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering

in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies),

dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our heart and

it has become a household word that <I>il y a deux choses</I> for which

the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of

the proprieties, is the fittest nay, the only, garment. The first, said

she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to

fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my

ear), the first is a bath... but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall

cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our

store of knowledge.



<P>Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and while

all were conjecturing what might be the cause Miss Callan entered and,

having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with

a profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a party

of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less

severe than beautiful refrained the humorous sallies even of the most licentious

but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry. Strike me

silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. A monstrous fine bit

of cow-flesh! I'll be sworn she has rendezvoused you. What, you dog? Have

you a way with them? Gad's bud. Immensely so, said Mr Lynch. The bedside

manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice. Demme, does not Doctor

O'Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin? As I look to be saved I had

it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months.

Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning

a womanish simper and immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease

a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I'm all of a wibblywobbly. Why, you're

as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem that you are! May this pot of

four half choke me, cried Costello, if she ain't in the family way. I knows

a lady what's got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young

surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as

the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful

providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady

who was <I>enceinte</I> which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and

she had given birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience, said he, with those

who without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling

profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest

power for happiness upon the earth. I am positive when I say that if need

were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble

exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive

in the human breast. I cannot away with them. What? Malign such an one,

the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment

of ours and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child

of clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race

where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence

is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne. Having delivered himself

of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door.

A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low

soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would

he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression

by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that

he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals,

said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which

I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that

had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what

I always looks back on with a loving heart.



<P>To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious

of some impudent mocks which he, however, had borne with being the fruits

of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. The

young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children:

the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and

not often nice: their testiness and outrageous <I>mots</I> were such that

his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the

proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.

But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated

the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity

born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback teethed and feet first

into the world, which the dint of the surgeon's pliers in his skull lent

indeed a colour to, so as it put him in thought of that missing link of

creation's chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was now

for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed

through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy

and self a man of a rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress

all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest

precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which

base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable.

To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a

habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither

to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while

for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained

the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate

and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth

which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe,

is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer express it) for eating

of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon

any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful

occasions. To conclude, while from the sister's words he had reckoned upon

a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated

by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such

duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of

the Supreme Being.



<P>Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express

his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express

one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not

to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement

since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy young

blade said it was her husband's that put her in that expectation or at

least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. I must acquaint

you, said Mr Crothers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant

comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujerum was round again to-day, an elderly

man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word

of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. I bade him hold himself in readiness

for that the event would burst anon. 'Slife, I'll be round with you. I

cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock

another child out of her. All fell to praising of it, each after his own

fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another

than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy

(virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household.

Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty

of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the

dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the

mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch

of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art

which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. But, he further

added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress

them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.



<P>But with what fitness, let it be asked, of the noble lord, his patron,

has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to

civil rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity?

Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? During

the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados

did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece

against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for

the security of his four per cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets

all benefits received? Or is it that from being a deluder of others he

has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not his own

and his only enjoyer? Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber

of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the

most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention

there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it

so. Unhappy woman she has been too long and too persistently denied her

legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling

than the derision of the desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a

very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of

nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from

the lowest strata of society. Nay, had the hussy's scouringbrush not been

her tutelary angel it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian!

In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious

and in Mr Cuffe's hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a

scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic.

It ill becomes him to preach that gospel. Has he not nearer home a seed-field

that lies fallow for the want of a ploughshare? A habit reprehensible at

puberty is second nature and an opprobium in middlelife. If he must dispense

his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore

to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist

better with the doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is the

repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. The lewd suggestions

of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched

but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic

tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and

was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots

have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it

is stagnant, acid and inoperative.



<P>The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial

usages of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior

medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation

that an heir had been born. When he had betaken himself to the women's

apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the

presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members

of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation, the

delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping

that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous

absence of abigail and officer rendered the easier, broke out at once into

a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard

endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to restrain. The moment was too propitious

for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union

among tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively

eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean

section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with

respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs murder

and endered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which

secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture

and king's bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides,

simulated and dissimulated, acardiac <I>f<oe>tus in f<oe>tu</I>, aprosopia

due to a congestion, the agnatia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by

Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary

knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what

the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation

of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein,

the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual

case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination

by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause,

the problem of the perpetuation of the species in the case of females impregnated

by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers

<I>Sturzgeburt</I>, the recorded instances of multigeminal, twikindled

and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous

parents - in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has

classified in his master-piece with chromolithographic illustrations. The

gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with

as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy

such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a country stile lest,

by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction

upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained,

to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has

consecrated as the seat of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole,

supernumerary digits, negro's inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain

were alleged by one as a <I>primafacie</I> and natural hypothetical explanation

of swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten)

or doghaired infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory,

advanced by the taledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions

of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic

development at some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate

sustained against both these views with such heat as almost carried conviction

the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority

being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur

which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the

pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his words was immediate

but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution

from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better

than he knew know to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire

a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen

between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical

and theological dilemma in the even of one Siamese twin predeceasing the

other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom

for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent,

whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity

of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice,

he delivered briefly, and as some thought perfunctorily, the ecclesiastical

ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.



<P>But Malachias' tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up

the scene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and

in the recess appeared... Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep?

He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other

a phial marked <I>Poison</I>. Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted

on all faces while he eyed them with a ghastly grin. I anticipated some

such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history

is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the murderer of Samuel Childs. And how

I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me. This is the appearance

is on me. Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered

thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and

himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? My hell, and Ireland's,

is in this life. It is what I tried to obliterate my crime. Distractions,

rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised

the phial to his lips), camping out. In vain! His spectre stalks me. Dope

is my only hope... Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly

vanished and the panel slid back. An instant later his head appeared in

the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland row station at ten past

eleven. He was gone! Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host.

The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaan!

The sage repeated <I>Lex talionis</I>. The sentimentalist is he who would

enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Malachias,

overcome by emotion, ceased. The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the third

brother. His real name was Childs. The black panther was himself the ghost

of his own father. He drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks.

The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there.

The spider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from

his hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderer's ground.



<P>What is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the chameleon

to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful

with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood. No longer

is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence,

that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds.

He is young Leopold, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within

a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure of then

is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old

house in Clambrassil street to the high school, his book satchel on him

bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother's thought.

Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat

(ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for

the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not

for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas, a thing now of the

past!), and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife

reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin shyly acknowledging

(but the heart? tell me!) his studied baisemoins. The scent, the smile

but more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address brought home

at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm seated with Jacob's

pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may

be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some paper

from the Europe of a month before. But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed

on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, to a tiny speck within

the mist. Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons.

Who can say? The wise father knows his own child. He thinks of a drizzling

night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first. Together

(she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a

bare shilling and her luck-penny), together they hear the heavy tread of

the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university. Bridie!

Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night, first

night, the bridenight. They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer

with the willed, and in an instant (<I>fiat!</I>) light shall flood the

world. Did heart leap to heart? Nay, fair reader. In a breath 'twas done

but - hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through

the murk. She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night. She dare not

bear the sunnygolden babe of day. No, Leopold! Name and memory solace thee

not. That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee and in

vain. No son of thy loins is by thee. There is none now to be for Leopold,

what Leopold was for Rudolph.



<P>The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite

of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles

of cycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey twilight

ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her

dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. She follows her mother with

ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight phantoms are they

yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple

tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. They fade, sad phantoms: all

is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind

upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more. And on the highway of the clouds

they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. Huuh!

Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings

of whose brow are scorpions. Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon,

mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, <I>Lacus Mortis</I>.

Ominous, revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds,

horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned the

giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all

their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.



<P>Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible

gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine portent

grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven's own magnitude,

till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And, lo, wonder of metempsychosis,

it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride,

ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the

dear, the radiant. How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades,

in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed

with a veil of what do you call it gossamer! It floats, it flows about

her starborn flesh and loose it streams emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope,

sustained on currents of cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply

swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till after a myriad

metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon

the forehead of Taurus.



<P>Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at

school together in Conmee's time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.

Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the past and its

phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them into life across

the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call? Who supposes

it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver

of their life. He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves,

smiling at Vincent. That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him,

will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a

capful of light odes can call your genius father. All who wish you well

hope this for you. All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate.

I heartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent, Lenehan said, laying

a hand on the shoulder near him, have no fear. He could not leave his mother

an orphan. The young mans face grew dark. All could see how hard it was

for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He would

have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart.

Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider's name:

Lenehan as much more. He told them of the race. The flag fell and, huuh,

off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with O. Madden up. She was leading

the field: all hearts were beating. Even Phyllis could not contain herself.

She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight

on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew

level, reached, outstripped her. All was lost now. Phyllis was silent:

her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she cried, I am undone. But her lover

consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some

oval sugarplums which she partook. A tear fell: one only. A whacking fine

whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and three today.

What rider is like him? Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo

the victory in a hack canter is still his. But let us bear it as was the

ancient wont. Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light

sigh. She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this hand, shall we

behold such another. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do you remember her,

Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said, how young

she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow

shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it. The chestnuts

that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour

and with pollen floating by us. In the sunny patches one might easily have

cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that

Periplepomenos sells in his booth near the bridge. But she had nought for

her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously

when I pressed too dose. A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch,

but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. She is more taking then.

Her posies too! Mad romp that it is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined

together. And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as

we left the field. Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading,

I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera

or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet creature turned all colours in her

confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of

underwood clung there for the very trees adore her. When conmee had passed

she glanced at her lovely echo in the little mirror she carries. But he

had been kind. In going by he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind,

Lenehan said. If I had poor luck with Bass's mare perhaps this draught

of his may serve me more propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar:

Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the

scarlet label. Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His

soul is far away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision

as to be born. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access

to the incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos

told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests

initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the moon, Theosophos

told me, an orange-fiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain,

would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated

by the ruby-coloured egos from the second constellation.



<P>However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about

him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised, which

was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not

the case at all. The individual whose visual organs, while the above was

going on, were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation,

was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured

the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop.

During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at

a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent

which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to

where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone's remark

on account of its scarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently

transpired for reasons best known to himself which put quite an altogether

different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before's observations

about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions

of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe

unborn. Eventually, however, both their eyes met and, as soon as it began

to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing,

he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took

hold of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought

after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with,

also at the same time however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in

order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.



<P>The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of

the course of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The

debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the

loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne's house had never beheld

an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of

that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic. A gallant

scene in truth it made. Crothers was there at the foot of the table in

his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the

Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to him was Lynch, whose countenance

bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom. Next

the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while

at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden. The chair

of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank

of it the figure of Bannon in explorer's kit of tweed shorts and salted

cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred

manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board

was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and

metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion,

while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator,

fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust

of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour,

but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat

or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness

which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.



<P>It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted

transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) contentions would

appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted

scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with

tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the street has to

face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he

can. There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer

- at present - such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb.

Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. Must we accept the view

of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period,

assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long

neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it,

as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani,

Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This

would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature's favourite devices)

between the <I>nisus formativus</I> of the nemasperm on the one hand and

on the other a happily chosen position, <I>succubitus felix</I>, of the

passive element. The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely

less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently

remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways.

Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which

our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by

inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These facts, he alleges, and

the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters,

religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors,

exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic

bachelors and unfructified duennas - these, he said, were accountable for

any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied,

would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good

music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast

reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic

coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would

enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening

months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes

some of these demises to abnormal trauma in the case of women workers subjected

to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home

but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating

in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or

in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former (we are thinking

of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting

to count the sponges In the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative.

In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies

and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in

spite of our human shortcomings which often balk nature in her intentions.

An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.)

that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution,

tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general,

everything, in fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of some

remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify

our public parks, is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.

Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy

parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs

unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage

do not) must certainly, in the poet's words, give us pause. Nature, we

may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she

does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation

by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence

(modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance

can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier

stage of development, an arrangement, which, though productive of pain

to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of

us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing

thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) remark

(or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which

can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary

channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments

as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional

gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might

possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob,

reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency

above alluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately

acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded

esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness

in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides

himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the

vile parlance of our lower class licensed victuallers signifies the cookable

and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In a recent

public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the

commons' hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles

street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Mdw., F. K. Q.

C. P. I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses

as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthetic

allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of

all nature's processes, the act of sexual congress) she must let it out

again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk of

her own was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor none the less effective

for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.



<P>Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about

a happy <I>accouchement</I>. It had been a weary weary while both for patient

and doctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman

had manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and now she

was very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are

happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. Reverently

look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that

longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first

bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving

to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her

babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with

her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God's clay, the fruit

of their lawful embraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and

a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave

dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank,

College Green branch. O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now,

it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake

of her pretty head she recalls those days. God, how beautiful now across

the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about

the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he

had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa,

darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African

war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their

union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Young

hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third

cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer's office, Dublin Castle.

And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No, let

no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the ashes

from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings

for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read

in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low and so with a tranquil heart

to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His own good time. You too have

fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. Sir, to you my

hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant!



<P>There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories

which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they

abide there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them

be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were

not or at least were otherwise. Yet a chance word will call them forth

suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances,

a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid

the cool silver tranquillity of the evening or at the feast at midnight

when he is now filled with wine. Not to insult over him will the vision

come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut off

from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent,

remote, reproachful.



<P>The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession

of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied

trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness,

a <I>flair</I>, for the cruder things of life. A scene disengages itself

in the observer's memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural

a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought)

with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening,

the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant

slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets

as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its

fellow, with a brief alert shock. And yonder about that grey urn where

the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant

sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what

of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace

of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin

so daintily against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey

(blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long

the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that

circle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little just as this young man

does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of danger but must needs

glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the <I>piazzetta</I>

giving upon the flower-close with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach

(<I>alles Verg&auml;nghche</I>) in her glad look.



<P>Mark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that antechamber

of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces. Nothing,

as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of custody rather, befitting

their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels

about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago. But as before the lightning

the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in

swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber,

impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub

and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the

reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not

otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance

of the Word.



<P>Burke's! Outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail

of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor, punctual

Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants, bilbos,

Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and what not. A dedale of

lusty youth, noble every student there. Nurse Callan taken aback in the

hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon coming downstairs with news

of placentation ended, a full pound if a milligramme. They hark him on.

The door! It is open? Ha? They are out tumultuously, off for a minute's

race, all bravely legging it, Burke's of Denzille and Holles their ulterior

goal. Dixon follows, giving them sharp language but raps out an oath, he

too, and on. Bloom stays with nurse a thought to send a kind word to happy

mother and nurseling up there. Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet. Looks she

too not other now? Ward of watching in Horne's house has told its tale

in that washedout pallor. Them all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping

he whispers close in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?



<P>The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence celestial,

glistering on Dublin stone there under starshiny <I>coelum</I>. God's air,

the Allfather's air, scintillant circumambient cessile air. Breathe it

deep into thee. By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done a doughty deed

and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest progenitor barring none

in this chaffering allincluding most farraginous chronicle. Astounding!

In her lay a Godframed Godgiven preformed possibility which thou hast fructified

with thy modicum of man's work. Cleave to her! Serve! Toil on, labour like

a very bandog and let scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang. Thou art

all their daddies, Theodore. Art drooping under thy load, bemoiled with

butcher's bills at home and ingots (not thine!) in the countinghouse? Head

up? For every newbegotten thou shalt gather thy homer of ripe wheat. See,

thy fleece is drenched. Dost envy Darby Dullman there with his Joan? A

canting jay and a rheumeyed curdog is all their progeny. Pshaw, I tell

thee! He is a mule, a dead gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not worth

a cracked kreutzer. Copulation without population! No, say I! Herod's slaughter

of the innocents were the truer name. Vegetables, forsooth, and sterile

cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw, bleeding! She is a hoary pandemonium

of ills, enlarged glands, mumps, quinsy, bunions, hayfever, bedsores, ringworm,

floating kidney, Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious attacks, gallstones, cold

feet, varicose veins. A truce to threnes and trentals and jeremies and

all such congenital defunctive music. Twenty years of it, regret them not.

With thee it was not as with many that will and would and wait and never

do. Thou sawest thy America, thy lifetask, and didst charge to cover like

the transpontine bison. How saith Zarathusthra? <I>Deine kuh Tr&uuml;bsal

melkest Du. Nun trinkst Du die s&uuml;sse Milch des Euters</I>. See! It

displodes for thee in abundance. Drink, man, an udderful! Mother's milk,

Purefoy, the milk of human kin, milk too of those burgeoning stars overhead,

rutilant in thin rainvapour, punch milk, such as those rioters will quaff

in their guzzlingden, milk of madness, the honeymilk of Canaan's land.

Thy cow's dug was tough, what? Ay, but her milk is hot and sweet and fattening.

No dollop this but thick rich bonnyclaber. To her, old patriarch! Pap!

<I>Per deam Partulam et Pertundam nunc est bibendum!</I>

Circe</H1></CENTER>

<I>The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled

transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and

danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with

faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and

women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal

and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of

the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under

a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer</I>.



<P>THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.



<P>THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.



<P>(<I>A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling,

jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons

him</I>.)



<P>THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.



<P>THE IDIOT (<I>Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.</I>) Grhahute!



<P>THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?



<P>THE IDIOT (<I>Gobbing.</I>) Ghaghahest.



<P>(<I>They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung

between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled

by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again.

On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack

of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last

bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked

cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her

lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls

sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken

navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At

a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters,

loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a

man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a

room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from

the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings

shrill from a lane</I>.)

the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends

him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face</I>.)



<P>STEPHEN <I>Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.</I>



<P>(<I>The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway</I>.)

<P>STEPHEN (<I>Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista</I>.



<P>THE BAWD (<I>Spits in their trail her jet of venom.</I>) Trinity medicals.

<P>EDY BOARDMAN (<I>Bickering.</I>) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful

Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows

the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Triumphaliter</I>.) <I>Salvi facti i sunt</I>.



<P>(<I>He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering

light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after

him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.</I>)



<P>LYNCH So that?



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Looks behind</I>.) So that gesture, not music, not odours,

would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not

the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.



<P>LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!



<P>STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even

the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.



<P>LYNCH Ba!



<P>STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug?

This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold

my stick.



<P>LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?



<P>STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to <I>la belle dame sans merci</I>, Georgina

Johnson, <I>ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam</I>.



<P>(<I>Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands,

his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned

in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher</I>.)



<P>LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse.

Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.



<P>(<I>They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs

in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb.

The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark.

The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and

ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering

the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.</I>



<P><I>Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools,

middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond

the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves

the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under

the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate

into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait

shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents

to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level

Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of</I> <I>truculent Wellington

but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops

of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.</I>



<P><I>At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright

arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!



<P>(<I>He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming

rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing

Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing

a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with

wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses

a parcel against his rib and groans</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?



<P>(<I>He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset

siding. The glow leaps again</I>.)



<P>BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.



<P>(<I>He stands at Cormack's corner watching</I>.)



<P>BLOOM <I>Aurora borealis</I> or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of

course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush.

We're safe. (<I>He hums cheerfully</I>.) London's burning, London's burning!

On fire, on fire! (<I>He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the

crowd at the farther side of Talbot street</I>.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick.

Better cross here.



<P>(<I>He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout</I>.)



<P>THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (<I>Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns

aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling</I>.)



<P>THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Halts erect stung by a spasm</I>.) Ow.



<P>(<I>He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog</I> <I>a

dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him,

its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman

bangs his footgong</I>.)



<P>THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.



<P>(<I>The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved

hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward,

pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys</I>.)



<P>THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes

a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand</I>.) No thoroughfare.

Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises

again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential.

(<I>He feels his trouser pocket</I>.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily

catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria

peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick.

Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might

be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style

of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken

in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem

of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (<I>He closes his

eyes an instant</I>.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other.

Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!



<P>(<I>A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall,

a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero

the figure regards him with evil eye</I>.)



<P>BLOOM <I>Buenos noches, se&ntilde;orita Blanca, que calle es esta?</I>



<P>THE FIGURE (<I>Impassive, raises a signal arm</I>.) Password. <I>Sraid

Mabbot</I>.



<P>BLOOM Haha. <I>Merci</I>. Esperanto. <I>Slan leath. (He mutters</I>.)

Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.



<P>(<I>He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps

left, ragsackman left</I>.)



<P>BLOOM I beg. (<I>He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted

by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost

my way and contributed to the columns of the <I>Irish Cyclist</I> the letter

headed, In <I>darkest Stepaside</I>. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags

and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes

for. Wash off his sins of the world.



<P>(<I>Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom</I>.)



<P>BLOOM O!



<P>(<I>Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there.

Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket,

sweets of sin, potato soap</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch

your purse.



<P>(<I>The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled

form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan

of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles

hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn

face</I>.)



<P>RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken

goy ever. So. You catch no money.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen,

feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi</I>.



<P>RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (<I>With

feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face</I> <I>of Bloom</I>) Are

you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son

Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers

Abraham and Jacob?



<P>BLOOM (<I>With precaution</I>.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All

that's left of him.



<P>RUDOLPH (<I>Severely</I>.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog

after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?



<P>BLOOM (<I>In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered,

in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch

and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with

stiffening mud</I>.) Harriers, father. Only that once.



<P>RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make

you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Weakly</I>.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy.

I slipped.



<P>RUDOLPH (<I>With contempt) Ooim nachez</I>. Nice spectacles for your

poor mother!



<P>BLOOM Mamma!



<P>ELLEN BLOOM (<I>In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle,

widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens

and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase

banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm</I>.)

O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (<I>She

hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat.

A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out</I>.)

Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?



<P>(<I>Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels

in his filled pockets but desists, muttering</I>.)



<P>A VOICE (<I>Sharply</I>.) Poldy!



<P>BLOOM Who? (<I>He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily</I>.) At your

service.



<P>(<I>He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in

Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet

trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles

her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free

only her lace dark eyes and raven hair</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Molly!



<P>MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak

to me. (<I>Satirically</I>.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so

long?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Shifts from foot to foot</I>.) No, no. Not the least little

bit.



<P>(<I>He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions,

hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound.

A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles

are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a

turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his

bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely

she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him

in Moorish</I>.)



<P>MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.



<P>(<I>The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit,

offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his

head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops

his back for leapfrog</I>.)



<P>BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion...

if you...



<P>MARION So you notice some change? (<I>Her hands passing slowly over

her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes</I>.) O Poldy,

Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide

world.



<P>BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water.

Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (<I>He

pats divers pockets</I>.) This moving kidney. Ah!



<P>(<I>He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon

soap arises, diffusing light and perfume</I>.)



<P>THE SOAP

<BLOCKQUOTE>We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;

<BR>He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(<I>The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appeals in the disc of the

soapsun</I>.)



<P>SWENY Three and a penny, please.



<P>BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.



<P>MARION (<I>Softly</I>.) Poldy!



<P>BLOOM Yes, ma'am?



<P>MARION <I>Ti trema un poco il cuore?</I>



<P>(<I>In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon,

humming the duet from Don Giovanni</I>)



<P>BLOOM Are you sure about that <I>Voglio?</I> I mean the pronunciati...



<P>(<I>He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes

his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering</I>.)



<P>THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched.

Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.



<P>(<I>She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie

Kelly stands</I>.)



<P>BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?



<P>(<I>With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues

with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom.

Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker</I>.)



<P>THE BAWD (<I>Her wolfeyes shining</I>.) He's getting his pleasure. You

won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night

before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.



<P>(<I>Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling,

and shows coyly her bloodied clout</I>.)



<P>GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (<I>She murmurs</I>.)

You did that. I hate you.



<P>BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.



<P>THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman

false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take

the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.



<P>GERTY (<I>To Bloom</I>.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer.

(<I>She paws his sleeve, slobbering</I>.) Dirty married man! I love you

for doing that to me.



<P>(<I>She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with

loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen,

smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth</I>.)



<P>MRS BREEN Mr.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Coughs gravely</I>.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure

by letter dated the sixteenth instant .



<P>MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you

nicely! Scamp!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Hurriedly</I>.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think

me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since

I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having

this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting

quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Holds up a finger</I>.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know

somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (<I>Slily</I>.)

Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Looks behind</I>.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming.

The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello

black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore

christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.



<P>(<I>Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks,

upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap

out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle

the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle

through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe

heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips</I>.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>There's someone in the house with Dina

<BR>There's someone in the house, I know,

<BR>There's someone in the house with Dina

<BR>Playing on the old banjo.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(<I>They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling,

trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>With a sour tenderish smile</I>.) A little frivol, shall we,

if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for

a fraction of a second?



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Screams gaily</I>.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!



<P>BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage

mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner

for you. (<I>Gloomily</I>.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear

gazelle.



<P>MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (<I>She

puts out her hand inquisitively</I>.) What are you hiding behind your back?

Tell us, there's a dear.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Seizes her wrist with his free hand</I>.) Josie Powell that

was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking

back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's

housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the

pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?



<P>MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation

and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings,

blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs,

a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand</I>.) Ladies and gentlemen,

I give you Ireland, home and beauty.



<P>MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Meaningfully dropping his voice</I>.) I confess I'm teapot

with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little

teapot at present.



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Gushingly</I>.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot

and I'm simply teapot all over me. (<I>She rubs sides with him</I>.) After

the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the

staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his

fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which

she surrenders gently</I>.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter

out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (<I>Tenderly, as he slips on her finger

a ruby ring.) L&agrave; ci darem la mano</I>.



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue,

a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her

moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio

e non</I>. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.



<P>BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and

the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (<I>His clenched fist at his

brow</I>.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (<I>Hoarsely</I>.)

Woman, it's breaking me! (<I>Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom

Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard

thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in

the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter</I>.)



<P>ALF BERGAN (<I>Points jeering at the sandwich boards</I>.) U.p.: Up.



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>To Bloom</I>.) High jinks below stairs. (<I>She gives

him the glad eye</I>.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You

wanted to.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Shocked</I>.) Molly's best friend! Could you?



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss</I>.)

Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Off handedly</I>.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without

potted meat is incomplete. I was at <I>Leah</I>. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant

exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling

good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.



<P>(<I>Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears

weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which

a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows

it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked

pills</I>.)



<P>RICHIE Best value in Dub.



<P>(<I>Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his

napkin, waiting to wait</I>.)



<P>PAT (<I>Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy</I>.) Steak

and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.



<P>RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...



<P>(<I>With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching

by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn</I>.)



<P>RICHIE (<I>With a cry of pain, his hand to his back</I>) Ah! Bright's!

Lights!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Points to the navvy</I>.) A spy. Don't attract attention.

I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.



<P>MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and

bull story.



<P>BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here.

But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>All agog</I>.) O, not for worlds.



<P>BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?



<P>MRS BREEN Let's.



<P>(<I>The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen.

The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail</I>.)



<P>THE BAWD Jewman's melt!



<P>BLOOM (<I>In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel,

tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white

spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier

and a grey billycock hat</I>.) Do you remember a long long time, years

and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when

we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider

veil</I>.) Leopardstown.



<P>BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three

year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater

shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on

that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes

advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a

bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like

she did it on purpose...



<P>MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!



<P>BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky

little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired

on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a

pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart

the size of a fullstop.



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Squeezes his arm, simpers</I>.) Naughty cruel I was.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Low, secretly, ever more rapidly</I>.) And Molly was eating

a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly,

though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style.

She was .



<P>MRS BREEN Too.



<P>BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly

were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses,

the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses

was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if

I ever heard or read or knew or came across .



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Eagerly</I>.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.



<P>(<I>She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on

towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet

apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen

to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour.

An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight</I>.)



<P>THE GAFFER (<I>Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout</I>.) And when

Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after

doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on

the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.



<P>THE LOITERERS (<I>Guffaw with cleft palates</I>.) O jays!



<P>(<I>Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their

lodges they frisk limblessly about him</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad

daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.



<P>THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the

men's porter.



<P>(<I>Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled,

call from lanes, doors, corners</I>.)



<P>THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got

a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.



<P>(<I>He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond.

From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk.

In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats</I>.)



<P>THE NAVVY (<I>Belching</I>.) Where's the bloody house?



<P>THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable

woman.



<P>THE NAVVY (<I>Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them</I>.)

Come on, you British army!



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Behind his back</I>.) He aint half balmy.



<P>PRIVATE COMPTON (<I>LAughs</I>.) What ho!



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>To the navvy</I>.) Portobello barracks canteen. You

ask for Carr. Just Carr.



<P>THE NAVVY (<I>Shouts</I>.)



<P>We are the boys. Of Wexford.



<P>PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?



<P>PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.



<P>THENAVVY (<I>Shouts</I>.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>The galling chain.

<BR>And free our native land.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(<I>He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault.

The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they

are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland

row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with

engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night

or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following

him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs

Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll

lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs.

What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with

that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind.

Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day

two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet

only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What

was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.



<P>(<I>He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend</I> Wet

Dream and <I>a phallic design</I>.)



<P>Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's

that like? (<I>Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window

embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed

floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths</I>.)



<P>THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.



<P>BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get

all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much.

(<I>The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging

his tail</I>.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better

speak to him first. Like women they like <I>rencontres</I>. Stinks like

a polecat. <I>Chacun son go&ucirc;t</I>. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain

in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (<I>The wolfdog sprawls on his

back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling

out</I>.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided

nobody. (<I>Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's

tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one

parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the

trotter</I>.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand.

Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide.

Two and six.



<P>(<I>With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff

mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching

the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur

together</I>.)



<P>THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.



<P>(<I>Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder</I>.)



<P>FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Stammers</I>.) I am doing good to others.



<P>(<I>A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime

with Banbury cakes in their beaks</I>.)



<P>THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.



<P>BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.



<P>(<I>He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over

the munching spaniel</I>.)



<P>BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.



<P>(<I>The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle

between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran

falls silently into an area</I>.)



<P>SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Enthusiastically</I>.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver

on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab.

Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram.

All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.



<P>(<I>Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond

studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a

curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound</I>.)



<P>SIGNOR MAFFEI (<I>With a sinister smile</I>.) Ladies and gentlemen,

my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with

my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted

thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel,

no matter how fractious, even <I>Leo ferox</I> there, the Libyan maneater.

A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced

Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (<I>He glares</I>.) I possess the

Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (<I>With

a bewitching smile</I>.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of

the ring.



<P>FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.



<P>BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (<I>He takes off his

high grade hat, saluting</I>.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have

heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. <I>Donnerwetter</I>! Owns

half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.



<P>FIRST WATCH Proof.



<P>(<I>A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing

a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers

it</I>.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs

John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.



<P>FIRST WATCH (<I>Reads</I>.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully

watching and besetting.



<P>SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower</I>.)

This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his

name. (<I>Plausibly</I>.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom.

The change of name Virag. (<I>He murmurs privately and confidentially</I>.)

We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement.

(He <I>shoulders the second watch gently</I>.) Dash it all. It's a way

we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (<I>He turns gravely

to the first watch</I>.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes.

Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (<I>To the second

watch gaily</I>.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake

of a lamb's tail.



<P>(<I>A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure</I>.)



<P>THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of

the army.



<P>MARTHA (<I>Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the

Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing</I>.) Henry! Leopold!

Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.



<P>FIRST WATCH (<I>Sternly</I>.) Come to the station.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart

and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard

of fellowcraft</I>.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken

identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs

fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I

am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully

condemned.



<P>MARTHA (<I>Sobbing behind her veil</I>.) Breach of promise. My real

name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell

my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Behind his hand</I>.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated.

(<I>He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim</I>.) Shitbroleeth.



<P>SECOND WATCH (<I>Tears in his eyes, to Bloom</I>.) You ought to be thoroughly

well ashamed of yourself.



<P>BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am

a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable

married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street.

My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant

upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one

of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority

for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.



<P>FIRST WATCH Regiment.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Turns to the gallery</I>.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt

of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in

arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police,

guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men,

as physique, in the service of our sovereign.



<P>A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?



<P>BLOOM (<I>His hand on the shoulder of the first watch</I>.) My old dad

too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with

the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General

Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned

in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (<I>With quiet feeling</I>.)

Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.



<P>FIRST WATCH Profession or trade.



<P>BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact

we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the

inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with

the British and Irish press. If you ring up...



<P>(<I>Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His

scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat</I>.<I> He dangles

a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone

receiver nozzle to his ear</I>.)



<P>MYLES CRAWFORD (<I>His cock's wattles</I> wagging.) Hello, seventyseven

eightfour. Hello. <I>Freeman's Urinal</I> and <I>Weekly Arse wiper</I>

here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?



<P>(<I>Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate

morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased

lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled</I>

Matcham's Masterstrokes.)



<P>BEAUFOY (<I>Drawls</I>.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know

it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most

rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly

loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading

as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness

he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect

gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books

of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar,

are a household word throughout the kingdom.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Murmurs with hangdog meekness</I>.) That bit about the laughing

witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?



<P>BEAUFOY (<I>His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court</I>.)

You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't

think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard.

My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord,

we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably

out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims,

who has not even been to a university.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Indistinctly</I>.) University of life. Bad art.



<P>BEAUFOY (<I>Shouts</I>.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral

rottenness of the man! (He <I>extends his portfolio</I>.) We have here

damning evidence, the <I>corpus delicti</I>, my lord, a specimen of my

maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.



<P>A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY

<BLOCKQUOTE>Moses, Moses, king of the jews,

<BR>Wiped his arse in the Daily News.</BLOCKQUOTE>

BLOOM (<I>Bravely</I>.) Overdrawn.



<P>BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter!

(<I>To the court</I>.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple

existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed

society. The arch conspirator of the age.



<P>BLOOM (<I>To the court</I>.) And he, a bachelor, how.



<P>FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.



<P>THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!



<P>(<I>Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket

on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand</I>.)



<P>SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?



<P>MARY DRISCOLL (<I>Indignantly</I>.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable

character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six

pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing

to his carryings on.



<P>FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?



<P>MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself

as poor as I am.



<P>BLOOM (<I>In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless

slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly</I>.) I treated you white.

I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously

I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in

all things. Play cricket.



<P>MARY DRISCOLL (<I>Excitedly</I>.) As God is looking down on me this

night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!



<P>FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?



<P>MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour,

when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety

pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he

interfered twice with my clothing.



<P>BLOOM She counterassaulted.



<P>MARY DRISCOLL (<I>Scornfully</I>.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush,

so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it

quiet!



<P>(<I>General laughter</I>.)



<P>GEORGES FOTTRELL (<I>Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly</I>.)

Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.



<P>(<I>Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins

a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in

his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though

branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve

the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as

a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully

brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been

lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now,

when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life

in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings

of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen

that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway

company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through

the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of

scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper

at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers

to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model

young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting

the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and

green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains

of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops

and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... </I>)



<P>(<I>Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that

they cannot hear</I>.)



<P>LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (<I>Without looking up from their notebooks</I>.)

Loosen his boots.



<P>PROFESSOR MACHUGH (<I>From the presstable, coughs and calls</I>.) Cough

it up, man. Get it out in bits.



<P>(<I>The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket.

Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A

plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly

agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment.

He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A</I>

Titbits <I>back number</I>.)



<P>(<I>Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash,

dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across

his nose, talks inaudibly</I>.)



<P>J. J. O'MOLLOY (<I>In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with

a voice of pained protest</I>.) This is no place for indecent levity at

the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden

nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an

infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and

is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was

due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination,

such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted

in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. <I>Prima facie</I>,

I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy

did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue

was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism.

There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family.

If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest

that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself,

my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission

is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions.

Not all there, in fact.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic

toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly,

passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor

fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing

one thumb heavenward</I>.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (<I>He begins

to lilt simply</I>.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>Li li poo lil chile,

<BR>Payee two shilly...</BLOCKQUOTE>

(<I>He is howled down</I>.)



<P>J. J. O'MOLLOY (<I>Hotly to the populace</I>.) This is a lonehand fight.

By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this

fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded

the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing

for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory

before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person

was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (<I>Bloom

takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips</I>.) I shall call

rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again

at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately

bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly

which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took

the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had

worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him

as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the

mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia

Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (<I>To Bloom</I>.) I suggest

that you will do the handsome thing.



<P>BLOOM A penny in the pound.



<P>(<I>The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping

in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino,

citron and a pork kidney</I>.)



<P>DLUGACZ (<I>Hoarsely</I>.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.



<P>(<I>J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his

coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken

eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor.

He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping

tide of rosepink blood</I>.)



<P>J. J. O'MOLLOY (<I>Almost voicelessly</I>.) Excuse me, I am suffering

from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen

words. (<I>He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence

of Seymour Bushe</I>.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught

that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring

deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit

of the doubt. (<I>A paper with something written on it is handed into court</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>In court dress</I>.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan,

Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon,

ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest

. Queens of Dublin Society. (<I>Carelessly</I>.) I was just chatting this

afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball,

astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...



<P>MRS YELVERTON BARRY (<I>In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength

ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants

and panache of osprey in her hair</I>.) Arrest him constable. He wrote

me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the

North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch.

He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a

box of the <I>Theatre Royal</I> at a command performance of <I>La Cigale</I>.

I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct

myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time.

He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul

de Kock, entitled <I>The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays</I>.



<P>MRS BELLINGHAM (<I>In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose,

steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses

which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff</I>.) Also to me. Yes,

I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage

door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap

of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop

in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss

culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a

botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of

the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.



<P>MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!



<P>(<I>A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward</I>.)



<P>THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (<I>Screaming</I>.) Stop thief! Hurrah there,

Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!



<P>SECOND WATCH (<I>Produces handcuffs</I>.) Here are the darbies.



<P>MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome

compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound

coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious

of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to

my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial

bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped

or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves

in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden

treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged

me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the

marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.



<P>THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (<I>In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots

cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea

drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt

constantly</I>.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Ph<oe>nix

park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know,

shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings

win the final chukkar on his darling cob <I>Centaur</I>. This plebeian

Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes

an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards,

insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude

senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by

him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero,

evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin

with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an

unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride

and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.



<P>MRS BELLINGHAM Me too.



<P>MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.



<P>(<I>Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters

received from Bloom</I>.)



<P>THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (<I>Stamps her jingling spurs in a

sudden paroxysm of sudden fury</I>.) I will, by the God above me. I'll

scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay

him alive.



<P>BLOOM (<I>His eyes closing, quails expectantly</I>.) Here? (<I>He squirms</I>.)

Again! (<I>He pants cringing</I>.) I love the danger.



<P>THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for

you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.



<P>MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and

stripes on it!



<P>MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married

man!



<P>BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling

glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.



<P>THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (<I>Laughs derisively</I>.) O, did

you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of

your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained

for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.



<P>MRS BELLINGHAM (<I>Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively</I>.)

Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within

an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien</I>.)

O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet.

Let me off this once. (<I>He offers the other cheek</I>.)



<P>MRS YELVERTON BARRY (<I>Severely</I>.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs

Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!



<P>THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (<I>Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently</I>.)

I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped!

To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets.

I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (<I>She

swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air</I>.) Take down his trousers

without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?



<P>BLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.



<P>(<I>Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys</I>.)

<P>BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?



<P>ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse.

Mother Slipperslapper. (<I>Familiarly</I>.) She's on the job herself tonight

with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for

her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (<I>Suspiciously</I>.)

You're not his father, are you?



<P>BLOOM Not I!



<P>ZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?



<P>(<I>His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over

his left thigh</I>.)



<P>ZOE How's the nuts?



<P>BLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose.

One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.



<P>ZOE (<I>In sudden alarm</I>.) You've a hard chancre.



<P>BLOOM Not likely.



<P>ZOE I feel it.



<P>(<I>Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a</I>

<I>hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist

lips</I>.)



<P>BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.



<P>ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?



<P>(<I>She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm,

cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note,

oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed

with kohol. His smile softens</I>.)



<P>ZOE You'll know me the next time.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Forlornly</I>.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure

to.



<P>(<I>Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes.

Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong

hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by

the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white,

still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth

roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes,

strangely murmuring</I>.)



<P>ZOE (<I>Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously

smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith

Hierushaloim</I>.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Fascinated</I>.) I thought you were of good stock by your

accent.



<P>ZOE And you know what thought did?



<P>(<I>She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on

him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a

sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat

awkward hand</I>.) Are you a Dublin girl?



<P>ZOE (<I>Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil</I>.)

No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?



<P>BLOOM (<I>As before</I>.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish

device. (<I>Lewdly</I>.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder

of rank weed.



<P>ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.



<P>BLOOM (<I>In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating

tie and apache cap</I>.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought

from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence

by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will,

understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years

before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies.

All our habits. Why, look at our public life!



<P>(<I>Midnight chimes from distant steeples</I>.)



<P>THE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!



<P>BLOOM (<I>In alderman's gown and chain</I>.) Electors of Arran Quay,

Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say,

from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's

my programme. <I>Cui Bono?</I> But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their

phantom ship of finance...



<P>AN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!



<P>(<I>The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps</I>.)



<P>THE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!



<P>(<I>Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city

shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice

Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white

silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod

vigorously in agreement</I>.)



<P>LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (<I>In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral

chain and lace white silk scarf</I>) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech

be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he

was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare

hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated

Boulevard Bloom.



<P>COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Impassionedly</I>.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen

as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they?

Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses,

supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous

hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted

labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain

stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf

and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...



<P>(<I>Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring

up. A streamer bearing the legends</I> Cead Mille Failte <I>and</I> Mah

Ttob Melek Israel <I>spans the street. All the windows are thronged with

sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal

Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders

and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys

from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills,

cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering.

The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance

playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted,

trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal

standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of

the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in

a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They

are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin,

the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway,

Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees

and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire

Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order

of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal

Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most

reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland,

the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist,

anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of

the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands

with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers,

law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners,

tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators,

bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters,

corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers,

fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands,

bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato

factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen

of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone,

the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying

the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible.

Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of

welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson

velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb

and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone

with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall.

Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals.

The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid

the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes</I>.)



<P>BLOOM'S BOYS

<BLOCKQUOTE>The wren, the wren,

<BR>The king of all birds,

<BR>Saint Stephen's his day,

<BR>Was caught in the furze.</BLOCKQUOTE>

A BLACKSMITH (<I>Murmurs</I>.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom?

He scarcely looks thirtyone.



<P>A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest

reformer. Hats off!



<P>(<I>All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly</I>.)



<P>A MILLIONAIRESS (<I>Richly</I>.) Isn't he simply wonderful?



<P>A NOBLEWOMAN (<I>Nobly</I>.) All that man has seen!



<P>A FEMINIST (<I>Masculinely</I>.) And done!



<P>A BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.



<P>(<I>Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest</I>.)



<P>THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor

president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant

ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!



<P>ALL God save Leopold the First!



<P>BLOOM (<I>In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor

with dignity</I>.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.



<P>WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (<I>In purple stock and shovel hat</I>.)

Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments

in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears</I>.) So may

the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.



<P>MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (<I>Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's

head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem</I>. Leopold,

Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!



<P>(<I>Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring.

He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers

put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ

church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks

go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers

do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting</I>.)



<P>THE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.



<P>(<I>Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond.

His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary

transmitters are set for reception of message</I>.)



<P>BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix

hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our

former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene,

the splendour of night.



<P>(<I>The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the

Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent

on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst

of cheering</I>.)



<P><I>JOHN HOWARD PARNELL</I> (<I>Raises the royal standard</I>.) Illustrious

Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Embraces John Howard Parnell</I>.) We thank you from our heart,

John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of

our common ancestors.



<P>(<I>The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter.

The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He

shows all that he is wearing green socks</I>.)



<P>TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.



<P>BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy

at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with

telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do

we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left

our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their

warcry, <I>Bonafide Sabaoth</I>, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.



<P>THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!



<P>JOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.



<P>A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!



<P>AN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you

are.



<P>AN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.



<P>BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell

you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall

ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem

in the Nova Hibernia of the future.



<P>(<I>Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland,

under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem.

It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge

pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension

several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are

temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to

the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked

in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part

of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses</I>.)



<P>THE SIGHTSEERS (<I>Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die</I>.)



<P>(<I>A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points

an elongated finger at Bloom</I>.)



<P>THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man

is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.



<P>BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!



<P>(<I>A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his

sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful

enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees,

are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration

medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars,

free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied

with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock</I>, billets doux <I>in

the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole,

bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40</I> <I>days' indulgences,

spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets

available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian

lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst

Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals

for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth? (historic), Expel that Pain (medic),

Infant's Compendium of the Universe (cosmic), Let's All Chortle (hilaric),

Canvasser's Vade Mecum (journalic), love-letters of Mother Assistant (erotic),

Who's Who in Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's

Way to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward

to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through

the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great

acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings

are held up</I>.)



<P>THE WOMEN Little father! Little father!



<P>THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS

<BLOCKQUOTE>Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,

<BR>Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Hajajaja.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Shaking hands with a blind stripling</I>.) My more than Brother!

younger. (<I>He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics</I>.) Leg

Ah, naughty, naughty! (<I>He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly,

farmer</I>.) Fine! Splendid! (<I>He refuses to accept three shillings offered

him by Joseph Hynes, journalist</I>.) My dear fellow, not at all! (<I>He

gives his coat to a beggar</I>.) Please accept. (<I>He takes part in a

Wriggle it, girls!



<P>THE CITIZEN (<I>Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald

<P>(<I>The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper

<P>JIMMY HENRY The Court of Conscience is now open. His Most Catholic Majesty

will now administer open air justice. Free medical and legal advice, solution

of doubles and other problems. All cordially invited. Given at this our

<P>PADDY LEONARD What am I to do about my rates and taxes?



<P>BLOOM Pay them, my friend.



<P>PADDY LEONARD Thank you.



<P>NOSEY FLYNN Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Obdurately</I>.) Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts

you are bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum

of five pounds.

<P>LARRY O'ROURKE An eight day licence for my new premises. You remember

<P>BLOOM (<I>Coldly</I>.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts

no presents.



<P>CROFTON This is indeed a festivity.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Solemnly</I>.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.



<P>ALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?



<P>BLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments.

New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres

and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory

manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric

dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease.

General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all,

esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers

and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in

a free lay state.



<P>O'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.



<P>DAVY BYRNE (<I>Yawning</I>.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!



<P>BLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.

<P>(<I>Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration.

All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging

Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also

<P>THE VEILED SIBYL (<I>Enthusiastically</I>.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory

funniest man on earth.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Winks at the bystanders</I>.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.



<P>THEODORE PUREFOY (<I>In fishing cap and oilskin jacket</I>.) He employs

a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.



<P>THE VEILED SIBYL (<I>Stabs herself</I>.) My hero god! (<I>She dies</I>.)



<P>(<I>Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide

by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening

their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from

the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating

themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish

garters, leaping from windows of different storeys</I>.)



<P>ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (<I>Violently</I>.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites,

the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian

men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of

Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities

of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with

infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of

the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake

faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!



<P>THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!



<P>(<I>Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from

upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial

value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread,

sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Excitedly</I>.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke

again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother

Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the

viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, <I>sgenl inn ban bata

coisde gan capall</I>. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex

specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.



<P>DR MULLIGAN (<I>In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow</I>.)

Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's

private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy

is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis

have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of

chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely

bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake,

and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily

lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning.

I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid

test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to

be <I>virgo intacta.</I>



<P><I>(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs</I>.)



<P>DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations

I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine

in the national teratological museum.



<P>DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid.

Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.



<P>DR PUNCH COSTELLO The <I>fetor judaicus</I> is most perceptible.



<P>DR DIXON (<I>Reads a bill of health</I>.) Professor Bloom is a finished

example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable.

Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow

on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has

written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary

of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything.

He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on

a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas.

He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday.

He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree

reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child.

I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs

have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.



<P>(<I>General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American

makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques,

banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s,

wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly

collected</I>.)



<P>BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.



<P>MRS THORNTON (<I>In nursetender's gown</I>.) Embrace me tight, dear.

You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.



<P>(<I>Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white

children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive

plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably

dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and

interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible

letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor&eacute;e,

Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed

to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing

directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability

companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates</I>.)



<P>A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Darkly</I>.) You have said it.



<P>BROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.



<P>BANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.



<P>(<I>Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes

through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge

by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several

sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical

personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses

Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean

Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes,

all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.



<P>(<I>All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide

travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky

beards at Bloom</I>.)

<P>(<I>A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien,

<P>ZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.



<P>BLOOM (<I>In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues,

an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak

pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye</I>.) Let me be going now, woman

of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father

and mother of a bating. (<I>With a tear in his eye</I>.) All insanity.

Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not

to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (<I>He

gazes far away mournfully</I>.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite.

No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.



<P>ZOE (<I>Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet</I>.) Honest? Till the

next time. (<I>She sneers</I>.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the

bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Bitterly</I>.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and

bottle.



<P>ZOE (<I>In sudden sulks</I>.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give

a bleeding whore a chance.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Repentantly</I>.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary

evil. Where are you from? London?



<P>ZOE (<I>Glibly</I>.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm

Yorkshire born. (<I>She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple</I>.)

I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for

a short time? Ten shillings?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Smiles, nods slowly</I>.) More, houri, more.



<P>ZOE And more's mother? (<I>She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws</I>.)

Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll

peel off.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment

of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears</I>.) Somebody

would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (<I>Earnestly</I>.)

You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.



<P>ZOE (<I>Flattered</I>.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve

for. (<I>She pats him</I>.) Come.



<P>BLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.



<P>ZOE Babby!



<P>BLOOM (<I>In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair,

fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby

finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping</I>.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo

tlone.



<P>THE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.



<P>ZOE Silent means consent. (<I>With little parted talons she captures

his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor,

luring him to doom</I>.) Hot hands cold gizzard.



<P>(<I>He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards

the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted

eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek

of all the male brutes that have possessed her</I>.)



<P>THE MALE BRUTES (<I>Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in

their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro</I>.)

Good!



<P>(<I>Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated.

They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to

his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly</I>.)



<P>ZOE (<I>Her lucky hand instantly saving him</I>.) Hoopsa! Don't fall

upstairs.



<P>BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (<I>He stands aside at the threshold</I>.)

After you is good manners.



<P>ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.



<P>(<I>She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding

out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall

hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them,

frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown

open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with

an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar

his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly

Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox:

then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade

of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round

a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth

mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped

over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked,

a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy.

The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In

the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged

on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand

he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume,

doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her

hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing

at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset

lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple

at the piano</I>.)



<P>KITTY (<I>Coughs behind her hand</I>.) She's a bit imbecilic. (<I>She

signs with a waggling forefinger</I>.) Blemblem. (<I>Lynch lifts up her

skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly</I>.)

Respect yourself. (<I>She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under

which her hair glows, red with henna</I>.) O, excuse!



<P>ZOE More limelight, Charley. (<I>She goes to the chandelier and turns

the gas full cock</I>.)



<P>KITTY (<I>Peers at the gasjet</I>.) What ails it tonight?



<P>LYNCH (<I>Deeply</I>.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.



<P>ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.



<P>(<I>The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands

at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he

repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble

goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle

in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening.

A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid</I>.)



<P>KITTY (<I>Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot</I>.) O, excuse!



<P>ZOE (<I>Promptly</I>.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your

shift.



<P>(<I>Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over

her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar

on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the

squatted figure with its cap back to the front</I>.)



<P>STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto

Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an

old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate <I>C<oe>la enarrant gloriam Domini</I>.

It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian

and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's

or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his

chief bassoonist about his almightiness. <I>Mais, nom de nom, that is another

pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops,

points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs</I>.) Which side is your knowledge

bump?



<P>THE CAP (<I>With saturnine spleen</I>.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's

reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form

of life. Bah!



<P>STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes.

How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!



<P>THE CAP Bah!



<P>STEPHEN Here's another for you. (<I>He frowns</I>.) The reason is because

the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible

interval which .



<P>THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>With on effort</I>.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible

ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.



<P>THE CAP Which? (<I>Outside the gramophone begins to blare</I> The Holy

City.)



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Abruptly</I>.) What went forth to the ends of the world

to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller,

having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment.

Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself

was ineluctably preconditioned to become. <I>Ecco!</I>



<P>LYNCH (<I>With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins</I>.)

What a learned speech, eh?



<P>ZOE (<I>Briskly</I>.) God help your head, he knows more than you have

forgotten.



<P>(<I>With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen</I>.)



<P>FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.



<P>KITTY No!



<P>ZOE (<I>Explodes in laughter</I>.) Great unjust God!



<P>FLORRY (<I>Offended.)</I> Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ.

O, my foot's tickling.



<P>(<I>Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling</I>.)



<P>THE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea

serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.



<P>(<I>Stephen turns and sees Bloom</I>.)



<P>STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.



<P>(<I>Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his

spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from

which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder

he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass

of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its

breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked,

hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose,

tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness</I>.)



<P>ALL What?



<P>THE HOBGOBLIN (<I>His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his

eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then

all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il

vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round

and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches

juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits!

(The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus.

(The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off

into vacuum</I>.)



<P>FLORRY (<I>Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly</I>.) The end

of the world!



<P>(<I>A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity

occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares

over coughs and feetshuffling</I>.)



<P>THE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...



<P>(<I>A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it,

proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah.

Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End

of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs,

whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs

of Man</I>.)



<P>THE END OF THE WORLD (<I>With a Scotch accent</I>.) Wha'll dance the

keel row, the keel row, the keel row?



<P>(<I>Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice,

harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice

with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which

the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.</I>)



<P>ELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole

Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut.

Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is

12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick

ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop

run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second

advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ,

Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to

sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on

the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the

higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll.

Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation,

and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a

lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with

jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous.

It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and

getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy,

have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's

it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps.

(<I>He shouts</I>.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing.

Encore! (<I>He sings.) Jeru</I>...



<P>THE GRAMOPHONE (<I>Drowning his voice</I>.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.



<P>(<I>The disc rasps gratingly against the needle</I>.)



<P>THE THREE' WHORES (<I>Covering their ears, squawk</I>.) Ahhkkk!



<P>ELIJAH (<I>In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the

top of his voice, his arms uplifted</I>.) Big Brother up there, Mr President,

you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe

strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and

Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't

never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just

now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our

sisters dear. (<I>He winks at his audience</I>.) Our Mr President, he twig

the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.



<P>KITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I

did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister

married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I

was pure.



<P>ZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.



<P>FLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of

Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the

bed.



<P>STEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without

end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.



<P>(<I>The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon,

Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping,

tramp fast past in noisy marching</I>.)



<P>THE BEATITUDES (<I>Incoherently</I>.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum

barnum buggerum bishop.



<P>LYSTER (<I>In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly</I>.)

He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.



<P>(<I>He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered,

his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's

kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat</I>.)



<P>BEST (<I>Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the

crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot</I>.)

I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you

know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (<I>Produces a greencapped dark

lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent</I>.) Esthetics

and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for

a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.



<P>(<I>In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave,

holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees.

He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his

head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His

right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by

its two talons</I>.)



<P>MANANAAN MACLIR (<I>With a voice of waves</I>.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub!

Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos.

(<I>With a voice of whistling seawind</I>.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I

won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the

cult of Shakti. (<I>With a cry of stormbirds</I>.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark

hidden Father! (<I>He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his

left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac.

He wails with the vehemence of the ocean</I>.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am

the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.



<P>(<I>A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes

to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling</I>.)



<P>THE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!



<P>(<I>Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle</I>.)



<P>ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?



<P>LYNCH (<I>Tossing a cigarette on to the table</I>.) Here.



<P>ZOE (<I>Her head perched aside in mock pride</I>.) Is that the way to

hand the <I>pot</I> to a lady? (<I>She stretches up to light the cigarette

over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits.

Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters

up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly

at her cigarette</I>.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?



<P>LYNCH I'm not looking.



<P>ZOE (<I>Makes sheep's eyes</I>.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would

you suck a lemon?



<P>(<I>Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom,

then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue

fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling

his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and

gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate,

chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the

left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears

a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left

eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell.

On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his

ears</I>.)



<P>VIRAG (<I>Heels together bows</I>.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely.

(<I>He coughs thoughtfully, drily</I>.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in

evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that

she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular

devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.



<P>BLOOM Granpapachi. But...



<P>VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse

white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood,

is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone

in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so

performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you

in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?



<P>BLOOM She is rather lean.



<P>VIRAG (<I>Not unpleasantly</I>.) Absolutely! Well observed and those

pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to

suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which

a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe

the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what

you can wear today. Parallax! (<I>With a nervous twitch of his head</I>.)

Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!



<P>BLOOM (<I>An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek</I>.)

She seems sad.



<P>VIRAG (<I>Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left

eye with a finger and barks hoarsely</I>.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper

and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered

by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (<I>More genially</I>.)

Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There

is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated

vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of

the party, longcasted and deep in keel.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Regretfully</I>.) When you come out without your gun.



<P>VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money,

take your choice. How happy could you be with either...



<P>BLOOM With?...



<P>VIRAG (<I>His tongue upcurling</I>.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad.

She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal

in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two

protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday

soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances,

suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing

to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful

nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets

of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of

green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions

of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt

to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (<I>His throat twitches</I>.)

Slapbang! There he goes again.



<P>BLOOM The stye I dislike.



<P>VIRAG (<I>Arches his eyebrows</I>.) Contact with a goldring, they say.

<I>Argumentum ad feminam</I>, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece

in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's

sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (<I>He twitches</I>.)

It is a funny sound.



<P>(<I>He coughs encouragingly</I>.) But possibly it is only a wart. I

presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head?

Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Reflecting</I>.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax.

This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter

<P>VIRAG (<I>Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking</I>.)

Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten.

Exercise your mnemotechnic. <I>La causa &egrave; santa</I>. Tara. Tara.

(<I>Aside</I>.) He will surely remember.



<P>BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic

tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures.

Mnemo?



<P>VIRAG (<I>Excitedly</I>.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (<I>He

taps his parchmentroll energetically.)</I> This book tells you how to act

with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite,

melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about

amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with

horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar

and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike

women in male habiliments? (<I>With a dry snigger</I>.) You intended to

devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer

months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate!

From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say?

Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated

combinations, camiknickers? (<I>He crows derisively</I>.) Keekeereekee!



<P>(<I>Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled

mauve light, hearing the everflying moth</I>.)



<P>BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence

this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is

will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.



<P>VIRAG (<I>Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper</I>.) Insects of the

day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell

of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal

verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (<I>His yellow parrotbeak gabbles

nasally</I>.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year

five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey

will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice

malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time

we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (<I>He coughs and, bending

his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand</I>.) You shall

find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember

their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth

book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L.

B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are

again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate

sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!



<P>BLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self

then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...



<P>VIRAG (<I>His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key</I>.) Splendid!

Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (<I>He gobbles

gluttonously with turkey wattles</I>.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where

are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (<I>He unrolls his parchment rapidly

and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which

he claws</I>.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters

will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves

may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister

omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis.

Though they stink yet they sting. (<I>He wags head with cackling raillery</I>.)

Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Absently</I>.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always

open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet

Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy

to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way

through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like

those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.



<P>VIRAG (<I>His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly

closed, psalms in outlandish monotone</I>.) That the cows with their those

distended udders that they have been the known...



<P>BLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (<I>He repeats</I>.)

Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their

teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (<I>Profoundly</I>.) Instinct

rules the world. In life. In death.



<P>VIRAG (<I>Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers

at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries</I>.)

Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly

burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit

<P>(<I>From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes

forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed

sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed

bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears

dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's

face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and

sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles

down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous

tongue</I>.)

<P>FLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.



<P>STEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you

the letter about the lute?



<P>FLORRY (<I>Smirking</I>.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.

<P>PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with

the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you

Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.



<P>PHILIP DRUNK (<I>Impatiently</I>.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid

my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality.

Who was it told me his name?



<P>(<I>His lawnmower begins to purr</I>.) Aha, yes. <I>Zoe mou sas agapo</I>.

<P>ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business

with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know

you've a Roman collar.



<P>VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (<I>Harshly,

his pupils waxing</I>.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun.

I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why

I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional.

Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (<I>He wriggles</I>.) Woman, undoing with sweet

pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short

time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy

and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with

big lingam, the stiff one. (<I>He cries.) Coactus volui</I>. Then giddy

woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites,

spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (<I>He chases

<P>BLOOM Poor man!



<P>ZOE (<I>Lightly</I>.) Only for what happened him.



<P>BLOOM How?



<P>VIRAG (<I>A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage,

cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.)

Verfluchte Goim!</I> He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed.

Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch,

the pope's bastard. (<I>He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent

rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute

world</I>.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.



<P>KITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from

<P>LYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.



<P>STEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.



<P>(<I>His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland,

appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven

dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping

under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs

are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs

a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing

his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims

with bloated pomp</I>.)



<P>THE CARDINAL

<BLOCKQUOTE>Conservio lies captured.

<BR>He lies in the lowest dungeon

<BR>With manacles and chains around his limbs

<BR>Weighing upwards of three tons.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(<I>He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left

cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and

fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour</I>.) O, the poor

little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and

heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage

He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.



<P>(<I>A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself

with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims</I>.) I'm suffering

the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny

little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face

of the bloody globe.



<P>(<I>His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers,

imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat

from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers.

The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing,

zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male,

melodious</I>.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee,

And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.



<P>(<I>The trick doorhandle turns</I>.)



<P>THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.



<P>ZOE The devil is in that door.



<P>(<I>A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking

the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily

and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket

and offers it nervously to Zoe</I>.)



<P>ZOE (<I>Sniffs his hair briskly</I>.) Hum. Thank your mother for the

rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep,

pricks his ears</I>.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double

event?



<P>ZOE (<I>Tears open the silverfoil</I>.) Fingers was made before forks.

(<I>She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts

and then turns kittenishly to Lynch</I>.) No objection to French lozenges?

(<I>He nods. She taunts him</I>.) Have it now or wait till you get it?

(<I>He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle.

His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her</I>.)

Catch.



<P>(<I>She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites

it through with a crack</I>.)



<P>KITTY (<I>Chewing</I>.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have

lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with

his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.



<P>BLOOM (<I>In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic

forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards

the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with

impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right

arm downwards from his left shoulder</I>.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever

you are.



<P>(<I>A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside.

Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly.

Zoe offers him chocolate</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Solemnly</I>.) Thanks.



<P>ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.



<P>(<I>A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Takes the chocolate</I>.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla

calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus.

Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad.

Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (<I>He eats</I>.) Influence taste too, mauve.

But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better

late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.



<P>(<I>The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She

is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled

selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck

in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are

deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy,

slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace

pendant beryl eardrops</I>.)



<P>BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.



<P>(<I>She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom

with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face,

neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter</I>.)



<P>THE FAN (<I>Flirting quickly, then slowly</I>.) Married, I see.



<P>BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .



<P>THE FAN (<I>Half opening, then closing</I>.) And the missus is master.

Petticoat government.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Looks down with a sheepish grin</I>.) That is so.



<P>THE FAN (<I>Folding together, rests against her eardrop</I>.) Have you

forgotten me?



<P>BLOOM Yes. No.



<P>THE FAN (<I>Folded akimbo against her waist</I>.) Is me her was you

dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the

same now we? (<I>Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Wincing</I>.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber

which women love.



<P>THE FAN (<I>Tapping</I>.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Cowed</I>.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your

domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak,

with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too

late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open

at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according

to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica

in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower,

was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of

tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David

and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A

dog's spittle, as you probably... (<I>He winces</I>.) Ah!



<P>RICHIE GOULDING (<I>Bagweighted, passes the door</I>.) Mocking is catch.

Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.



<P>THE FAN (<I>Tapping</I>.) All things end. Be mine. Now.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Undecided</I>.) All now? I should not have parted with my

talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my

time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.



<P>THE FAN (<I>Points downwards slowly</I>.) You may.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace</I>.

) We are observed.



<P>THE FAN (<I>Points downwards quickly</I>.) You must.



<P>BLOOM (<I>With desire, with reluctance</I>.) I can make a true black

knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for

Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy.

I knelt once before today. Ah!



<P>(<I>Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to

the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked.

Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers

draws out and in her laces</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Murmurs lovingly</I>.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was

my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace

up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly

small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily

to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.



<P>THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Crosslacing</I>.) Too tight?



<P>THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.



<P>BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar

dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That

night she met... Now!



<P>(<I>He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises

his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow

dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.



<P>BELLO (<I>With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice</I>.) Hound

of dishonour!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Infatuated</I>.) Empress!



<P>BELLO (<I>His heavy cheekchops sagging</I>.) Adorer of the adulterous

rump!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Plaintively</I>.) Hugeness!



<P>BELLO Dungdevourer!



<P>BLOOM (<I>With sinews semiflexed</I>.) Magnificence.



<P>BELLO Down! (<I>He taps her on the shoulder with his fan</I>.) Incline

feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling.

On the hands down!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing</I>.)

Truffles!



<P>(<I>With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting,

snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut

tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most

excellent master</I>.)



<P>BELLO (<I>With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his

shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport

skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in

his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in</I>.)

Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's

glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Enthralled, bleats</I>.) I promise never to disobey.



<P>BELLO (<I>Laughs loudly</I>.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in

store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in!

I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek

me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to

be inflicted in gym costume.



<P>(<I>Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe</I>.



<P>ZOE (<I>Widening her slip to screen her</I>.) She's not here.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Closing her eyes</I>.) She's not here.



<P>FLORRY (<I>Hiding her with her gown</I>.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello.

She'll be good, sir.



<P>KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.



<P>BELLO (<I>Coaxingly</I>.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you,

darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk,

sweety. (<I>Bloom puts out her timid head</I>.) There's a good girly now.

(<I>Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward</I>.) I only want

to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender

behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Fainting</I>.) Don't tear my.



<P>BELLO (<I>Savagely</I>.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the

hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the

Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember

me for the balance of your natural life. (<I>His forehead veins swollen,

his face congested</I>.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning

after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle

of Guinness's porter. (<I>He belches</I>.) And suck my thumping good Stock

Exchange cigar while I read the <I>Licensed Victualler's</I> Gazette. Very

possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy

a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked

like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.



<P>(<I>He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!



<P>BELLO (<I>Twisting</I>.) Another!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Screams</I>.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body

aches like mad!



<P>BELLO (<I>Shouts</I>.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's

the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting,

damn you. (<I>He slaps her face</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...



<P>BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.



<P>ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.



<P>FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.



<P>KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.



<P>(<I>The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy

bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin

stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door</I>.)



<P>MRS KEOCH (<I>Ferociously</I>.) Can I help? (<I>They hold and pinion

Bloom</I>.)



<P>BELLO (<I>Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke,

nursing a fat leg</I>.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond

Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters.

Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me

about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider <I>Throwaway</I>

at twenty to one. (<I>He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear</I>.)

Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Goaded, buttocksmothered</I>.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!



<P>BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never

prayed before. (<I>He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar</I>.) Here,

kiss that. Both. Kiss. (<I>He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's

knees, calls in a hard voice</I>.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross.

I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (<I>He bends sideways and squeezes

his mount's testicles roughly, shouting</I>.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse

you in proper fashion. (<I>He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle</I>.)

The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the

gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.



<P>FLORRY (<I>Pulls at Bello</I>.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I

asked before you.



<P>ZOE (<I>Pulling at Florry</I>.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him

yet, suckeress?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Stifling</I>.) Can't.



<P>BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (<I>He holds in his breath</I>.) Curse it.

Here. This bung's about burst. (<I>He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting

his features, farts loudly</I>.) Take that! (<I>He recorks himself</I>)

Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.



<P>BLOOM (<I>A sweat breaking out over him</I>.) Not man. (<I>He sniffs</I>.)

Woman.



<P>BELLO (<I>Stands up</I>.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed

for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest,

a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your

male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously

rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Shrinks</I>.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must

I tip-touch it with my nails?



<P>BELLO (<I>Points to his whores</I>.) As they are now, so will you be,

wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits.

Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with

cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone

busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your

figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks,

pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course,

with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent

for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little

chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness

of lace round your bare knees will remind you...



<P>BLOOM (<I>A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace

male hands and nose, leering mouth</I>.) I tried her things on only once,

a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save

the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.



<P>BELLO (<I>Jeers</I>.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and

showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn

blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender,

eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short

trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs

Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?



<P>BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.



<P>BELLO (<I>Guffaws</I>.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You

were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and

lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated

by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor

Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury

of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&amp;Aelig;sus, the varsity

wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs,

dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (<I>He guffaws again</I>.) Christ, wouldn't

it make a Siamese cat laugh?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Her hands and features working</I>.) It was Gerald converted

me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High

School play <I>Vice Versa</I>. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated

by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds

his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.



<P>BELLO (<I>With wicked glee</I>.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When

you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on

the smoothworn throne.



<P>BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (<I>Earnestly</I>.)

And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.



<P>BELLO (<I>Sternly</I>.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in

the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing,

sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your

swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The

sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.



<P>THE SINS OF THE PAST (<I>In a medley of voices</I>.) He went through

a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of

the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn

at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to

the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal

strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached

to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages

offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively

smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting

couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in

bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet

paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and

a postal order?



<P>BELLO (<I>Whistles loudly</I>.) Say! What was the most revolting piece

of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out.

Be candid for once.



<P>(<I>Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering,

Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling,

Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the</I>...

)



<P>BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought

the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...



<P>BELLO (<I>Peremptorily</I>.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing.

Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line

of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I

give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !



<P>BLOOM (<I>Docile, gurgles</I>.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...



<P>BELLO (<I>Imperiously</I>.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue!

Speak when you're spoken to.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Bows</I>.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!



<P>(<I>He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall</I>.)



<P>BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes,

also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned

up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (<I>He places

a ruby ring on her finger</I>.) And there now! With this ring I thee own.

Say, thank you, mistress.



<P>BLOOM Thank you, mistress.



<P>BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in

the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one.

Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne.

Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you

on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss,

with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your

wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered

with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights

of old laid down their lives. (<I>He chuckles</I>.) My boys will be no

end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come

here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded

heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named

Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman

out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of

all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What

offers? (<I>He points</I>.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and

carry, basket in mouth. (<I>He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in

Bloom's vulva</I>.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you

a hardon? (<I>He shoves his arm in a bidder's face</I>.) Here, wet the

deck and wipe it round!



<P>A BIDDER A florin!



<P>(<I>Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell</I>.)



<P>A VOICE One and eightpence too much.



<P>THE LACQUEY Barang!



<P>CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.



<P>BELLO (<I>Gives a rap with his gavel</I>.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure

and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points.

Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If

I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid

gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's

milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa,

my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (<I>He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup</I>.)

So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?



<P>A DARKVISAGED MAN (<I>In disguised accent</I>.) Hoondert punt sterlink.



<P>VOICES (<I>Subdued</I>.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.



<P>BELLO (<I>Gaily</I>.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly

short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette,

is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the

long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts

of the <I>blas&eacute;</I> man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk

on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the

thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination

to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger

in mouth</I>.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.



<P>BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (<I>He

stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds

of Bloom's haunches</I>.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's

your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy,

sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy

a bucket or sell your pump. (<I>Loudly</I>.) Can you do a man's job?



<P>BLOOM Eccles Street.



<P>BELLO (<I>Sarcastically</I>.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the

world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned,

my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well

for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts

all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee,

belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he

has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months,

my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts

already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (<I>He spits

in contempt</I>.) Spittoon!



<P>BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds.

Unmentionable. I.



<P>BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.



<P>BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...



<P>BELLO (<I>Ruthlessly</I>.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's

will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years.

Return and see.



<P>(<I>Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold</I>.)



<P><I>SLEEPY HOLLOW</I> Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!



<P>BLOOM (<I>In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing,

fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond

panes, cries out</I>.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's!

But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.



<P>BELLO (<I>Laughs mockingly</I>.) That's your daughter, you owl, with

a Mullingar student.



<P>(<I>Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab

in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls,

her young eyes wonderwide</I>.)



<P>MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!



<P>BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote,

Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and

his men friends are living there in clover. <I>The Cuckoos' Rest!</I> Why

not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot,

exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless

dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander,

O.



<P>BLOOM They... I



<P>BELLO (<I>Cuttingly</I>.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette

carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp

to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue

you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate

the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook

of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling

brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.



<P>BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return.

I will prove...



<P>A VOICE Swear!



<P>(<I>Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between

his teeth</I>.)



<P>BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your

secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You

are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.



<P>BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?



<P>(<I>He bites his thumb</I>.)



<P>BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace

about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to

hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have

none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our

shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my

stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with

a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the

buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (<I>He explodes in

a loud phlegmy laugh</I>.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (<I>He pipes scoffingly</I>.)

Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Clasps his head</I>.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned!

I have suff... (<I>He weeps tearlessly</I>.)



<P>BELLO (<I>Sneers</I>.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!



<P>(<I>Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face

to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised,

in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph

Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie

Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With

swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom</I>.)



<P>THE CIRCUMCISED (<I>In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit

upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad</I>.



<P>VOICES (<I>Sighing</I>.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom?

Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so?

Ah, yes.



<P>(<I>From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall

of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with

hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto

and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom</I>.)



<P>THE YEWS (<I>Their leaves whispering</I>.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.



<P>THE NYMPH (<I>Softly</I>.) Mortal! (<I>Kindly</I>.) Nay, dost not weepest!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight,

with dignity</I>.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of

habit.



<P>THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster

picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh

tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act,

the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of

rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb

callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary

articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman.

Useful hints to the married.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Lifts a turtle head towards her lap</I>.) We have met before.

On another star.



<P>THE NYMPH (<I>Sadly</I>.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied

to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited

testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed

four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.



<P>BLOOM You mean <I>Photo Bits?</I>



<P>THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me

above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four

places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Humbly kisses her long hair</I>.) Your classic curves, beautiful

immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty,

almost to pray.



<P>THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Quickly</I>.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the

worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of

my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the

rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some

days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive

vent. (<I>He sighs</I>.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.



<P>THE NYMPH (<I>Her fingers in her ears</I>.) And words. They are not

in my dictionary.



<P>BLOOM You understood them?



<P>THE YEWS Ssh.



<P>THE NYMPH (<I>Covers her face with her hand</I>.) What have I not seen

in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Apologetically</I>.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong

side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long

ago.



<P>THE NYMPH (<I>Bends her head</I>.) Worse! Worse!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Reflects precautiously</I>.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't

her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after

weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed

utensil which has only one handle.



<P>(<I>The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade</I>.)



<P>THE WATERFALL

<BLOCKQUOTE>Poulaphouca Poulaphouca

<BR>Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.</BLOCKQUOTE>

THE YEWS (<I>Mingling their boughs</I>.) Listen. Whisper. She is right,

our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous

summer days.



<P>JOHN WYSE NOLAN (<I>In the background, in Irish National For ester's

uniform, doffs his plumed hat</I>.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days,

trees of Ireland!



<P>THE YEWS (<I>Murmuring</I>.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school

excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile

grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered

stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge</I>.) I was

in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the

mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned

tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the

herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist

of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End

of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.



<P>(<I>Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys

and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen

Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing

of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom</I>.)

<P>(<I>They cheer</I>.)

Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (<I>He cheers feebly</I>.)

Hurray for the High School!

kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the

boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom</I>.) Who profaned

our silent shade?

THE NYMPH (<I>With wide fingers</I>.) O! Infamy!



<P>BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of

the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time.

Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired,

I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's

operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto

Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked

tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides,

who saw?



<P>(<I>Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with

humid nostrils through the foliage</I>.)



<P>STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.

on the water</I>.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare.

Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (<I>Through

silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly

from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters</I>.)

<P>COUNCILLOR NANNETI (<I>Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced,

such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat

electric light. (<I>She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing

her forefinger in her mouth</I>.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then

could you... ?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Pacing the heather abjectly</I>.) O, I have been a perfect

pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to

which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton

Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.

her head, sighing</I>.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves

o'er the waters dull.



<P>(<I>Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps</I>.)



<P>THE BUTTON Bip!



<P>(<I>Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly</I>.)



<P>THE SLUTS

<BLOCKQUOTE>O Leopold lost the pin of his drawers

<BR>He didn't know what to do,

<BR>To keep it up,

<BR>To keep it up.</BLOCKQUOTE>

BLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were

only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing,

like an ass pissing.



<P>THE YEWS (<I>Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny

arms ageing and swaying</I>.) Deciduously!



<P>THE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (<I>A large moist stain appears

on her robe</I>.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment

of a pure woman. (<I>She clutches in her robe</I>.) Wait, Satan. You'll

sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (<I>She draws a poniard

and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his

loins</I>.) Nekum!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Starts up, seizes her hand</I>.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine

lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it?

What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (<I>He

clutches her veil</I>.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener,

or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh

Reynard?



<P>THE NYMPH (<I>With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast

cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks</I>.) Poli... !



<P>BLOOM (<I>Calls after her</I>.) As if you didn't get it on the double

yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it.

Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the

nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (<I>The fleeing nymph

raises a keen</I>.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind

me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool

someone else, not me. (<I>He sniffs</I>.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur.

Grease.



<P>(<I>The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him</I>.)



<P>BELLA You'll know me the next time.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Composed, regards her.) Pass&eacute;e</I>. Mutton dressed

as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last

thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin

drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They

have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple

screw propeller.



<P>BELLA (<I>Contemptuously</I>.) You're not game, in fact. (<I>Her sowcunt

barks</I>.) Fohracht!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Contemptuously</I>.) Clean your nailless middle finger first,

the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful

of hay and wipe yourself.



<P>BELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!



<P>BLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!



<P>BELLA (<I>Turns to the piano</I>.) Which of you was playing the dead

march from <I>Saul?</I>



<P>ZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (<I>She darts to the piano and bangs

chords on it with crossed arms</I>.) The cat's ramble through the slag.

(<I>She glances back</I>.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (<I>She

darts back to the table</I>.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my

own.



<P>(<I>Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom

approaches Zoe</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Gently</I>.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits,

a fine thing and a superfine thing.



<P>BLOOM (<I>With feeling</I>.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor

mamma.



<P>ZOE

<BLOCKQUOTE>Give a thing and take it back

<BR>God'll ask you where is that

<BR>You'll say you don't know

<BR>God'll send you down below.</BLOCKQUOTE>

BLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.



<P>STEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.



<P>ZOE Here. (<I>She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh

and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking</I>.) Those that hides

knows where to find.



<P>BELLA (<I>Frowns</I>.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't

you smash that piano. Who's paying here?



<P>(<I>She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking

out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her</I>.)



<P>STEPHEN (With <I>exaggerated politeness</I>.) This silken purse I made

out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me.

(<I>He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom</I>.) We are all in the same sweepstake,

Kinch and Lynch. <I>Dans ce bordel o&ugrave; tenons nostre &eacute;tat</I>.



<P>LYNCH (<I>Calls from the hearth</I>.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing

for me.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Hands Bella a coin</I>.) Gold. She has it.



<P>BELLA (<I>Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty</I>.) Do

you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Delightedly</I>.) A hundred thousand apologies. (<I>He fumbles

again and takes out and hands her two crowns</I>.) Permit, <I>brevi manu</I>,

my sight is somewhat troubled.



<P>(<I>Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to

himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over

Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist,

adds his head to the group</I>.)



<P>FLORRY (<I>Strives heavily to rise</I>.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (<I>She

limps over to the table. Bloom approaches</I>.)



<P><I>BELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM</I> (<I>Chattering and squabbling</I>.)

The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment...

this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're

pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're

a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink...

it's long after eleven.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence</I>.) No

bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.



<P>ZOE (<I>Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the

top of her stocking</I>.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.



<P>LYNCH (<I>Lifting Kitty from the table</I>.) Come!



<P>KITTY Wait. (<I>She clutches the two crowns</I>.)



<P>FLORRY And me?



<P>LYNCH Hoopla! (<I>He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the

sofa</I>.)



<P>STEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking

eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and

Florry</I>.) So. Allow me. (<I>He takes up the pound note</I>.) Three times

ten. We're square.



<P>BELLA (<I>Admiringly</I>.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could

kiss you.



<P>ZOE (<I>Points</I>.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (<I>Lynch bends Kitty

back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen</I>.)



<P>BLOOM This is yours.



<P>STEPHEN How is that? <I>Le distrait</I> or absentminded beggar. (<I>He

fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object

falls</I>.) That fell.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches</I>.) This.



<P>STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Quietly</I>.) You had better hand over that cash to me to

take care of. Why pay more?



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Hands him all his coins</I>.) Be just before you are generous.



<P>BLOOM I will but is it wise? (<I>He counts</I>.) One, seven, eleven,

and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.



<P>STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing

says. Thirsty fox. (<I>He laughs loudly</I>.) Burying his grandmother.

Probably he killed her.



<P>BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.



<P>STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.



<P>BLOOM No, but...



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Comes to the table</I>.) Cigarette, please. (<I>Lynch tosses

a cigarette from the sofa to the table</I>.) And so Georgina Johnson is

dead and married. (<I>A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at

it</I>.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (<I>He strikes a match and

proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy</I>.)



<P>LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it

if you held the match nearer.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Brings the match nearer his eye</I>.) Lynx eye. Must get

glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees

all flat. (<I>He draws the match away. It goes out</I>.) Brain thinks.

Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (<I>He frowns mysteriously</I>.)

Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.



<P>ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with

him.



<P>FLORRY (<I>Nods</I>.) Mr Lambe from London.



<P>STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.



<P>LYNCH (<I>Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem</I>.

(<I>The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws

it into the grate</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (<I>To Zoe</I>.)

You have nothing?



<P>ZOE Is he hungry?



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of

the bloodoath in the</I> Dusk of the Gods.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>Hangende Hunger,

<BR>Fragende Frau,

<BR>Macht uns alle kaput.</BLOCKQUOTE>

ZOE (<I>Tragically</I>.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (<I>She takes

his hand</I>.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (<I>She points to

his forehead</I>.) No wit, no wrinkles. (<I>She counts</I>.) Two, three,

Mars, that's courage. (<I>Stephen shakes his head</I>.) No kid.



<P>LYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake.

(<I>To Zoe</I>.) Who taught you palmistry?



<P>ZOE (<I>Turns</I>.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (<I>To Stephen</I>.)

I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (<I>She frowns with lowered

head</I>.)



<P>LYNCH (<I>Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice</I>.) Like that. Pandy

bat.



<P>(<I>Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies

open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs

up</I>.)



<P>FATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little

schemer. See it in your eye.



<P>(<I>Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee

rises from the pianola coffin</I>.)



<P>DON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very

good little boy.



<P>ZOE (<I>Examining Stephen's palm</I>.) Woman's hand.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Murmurs</I>.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could

read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.



<P>ZOE What day were you born?



<P>STEPHEN Thursday. Today.



<P>ZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (<I>She traces lines on his hand</I>.)

Line of fate. Influential friends.



<P>FLORRY (<I>Pointing</I>.) Imagination.



<P>ZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (<I>She peers at his hands

abruptly</I>.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want

to know?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Detaches her fingers and offers his palm</I>.) More harm than

good. Here. Read mine.



<P>BELLA Show. (<I>She turns up Bloom's hand</I>.) I thought so. Knobby

knuckles, for the women.



<P>ZOE (<I>Peering at Bloom's palm</I>.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea

and marry money.



<P>BLOOM Wrong.



<P>ZOE (<I>Quickly</I>.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband.

That wrong?



<P>(<I>Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches

her wings and clucks</I>.)



<P>BLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.



<P>(<I>She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Points to his hand</I>.) That weal there is an accident. Fell

and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.



<P>ZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.



<P>STEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years

ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse.

(<I>He winces</I>.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?



<P>(<I>Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and

writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves</I>.)



<P>FLORRY What?



<P>(<I>A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked

mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes

Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches

behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy

gaze</I>.)



<P>THE BOOTS (<I>Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.</I>)

Haw, haw, have you the horn?



<P>(<I>Bronze by gold they whisper</I>.)



<P>ZOE (<I>To Florry</I>.) Whisper.



<P>(<I>They whisper again.)</I>



<P><I>(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set

sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and

white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder</I>.)



<P>LENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off

a few quims?



<P>BOYLAN (<I>Seated, smiles</I>.) Plucking a turkey.



<P>LENEHAN A good night's work.



<P>BOYLAN (<I>Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks</I>.)

Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (<I>He holds out a forefinger</I>.)

Smell that.



<P>LENEHAN (<I>Smells gleefully</I>.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!



<P>ZOE AND FLORRY (<I>Laugh together</I>.) Ha ha ha ha.



<P>BOYLAN <I>bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear</I>.

) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?



<P>BLOOM (<I>In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings

and powdered wig</I>.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...



<P>BOYLAN (<I>Tosses him sixpence</I>.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and

splash. (<I>He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head</I>.)

Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?



<P>BLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.



<P>MARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (<I>She plops splashing

out of the water</I>.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt.

Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.



<P>BOYLAN (<I>A merry twinkle in his eye</I>.) Topping!



<P>BELLA What? What is it?



<P>(<I>Zoe whispers to her</I>.)



<P>MARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write

to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals

out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped

receipt.



<P>BELLA (<I>Laughing</I>.) Ho ho ho ho.



<P>BOYLAN (<I>To Bloom, over his shoulder</I>.) You can apply your eye

to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few

times.



<P>BLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness

the deed and take a snapshot? (<I>He holds an ointment jar</I>.) Vaseline,

sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...



<P>KITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.



<P>(<I>Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping

loudly, poppysmic plopslop</I>.)



<P>MINA KENNEDY (<I>Her eyes upturned</I>.) O, it must be like the scent

of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her!

Stuck together! Covered with kisses!



<P>LYDIA DOUCE (<I>Her mouth opening</I>.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her

round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris

and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.



<P>KITTY (<I>Laughing</I>.) Hee hee hee.



<P>BOYLAN'S VOICE (<I>Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach</I>.)

Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!



<P>MARION'S VOICE (<I>Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat</I>.) O! Weeshwashtkissima,

<P>BLOOM (<I>His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself</I>) Show! Hide! Show!

Plough her! More! Shoot!



<P>BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!



<P>LYNCH (<I>Points</I>.) The mirror up to nature. (<I>He laughs</I>.)

Hu hu hu hu hu hu.



<P>(<I>Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare,

beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection

of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall</I>.)



<P>SHAKESPEARE (<I>In dignified ventriloquy</I>.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks

the vacant mind. (<I>To Bloom</I>.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest

invisible. Gaze. (<I>He crows with a black capon's laugh</I>.) Iagogo!

How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Smiles yellowly at the whores</I>.) When will I hear the joke?



<P>ZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.



<P>BLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements

were taken near the skin after his death...



<P>(<I>Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk,

tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry,

rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood

of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers

and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance

policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy

hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling,

Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with

the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft</I>.)



<P>FREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!



<P>SUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!



<P>SHAKESPEARE (<I>With paralytic rage</I>.) Weda seca whokilla farst.



<P>(<I>The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares

beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside.

Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono

gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily</I>.)



<P>MRS CUNNINGHAM (<I>Sings</I>.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.



<P>MARTIN CUNNINGHAM



<P>(<I>Gazes on her impassive</I>.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!



<P>STEPHEN <I>Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti</I>. Queens lay with prize bulls.

Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first

confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of

the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.



<P>BELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.



<P>LYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.



<P>ZOE (<I>Runs to Stephen and links him</I>.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.



<P>(<I>Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where

he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile

on his face</I>.)



<P>LYNCH (<I>Pommelling on the sofa</I>.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.

<P>ZOE Go abroad and love a foreign lady.



<P>LYNCH Across the world for a wife.



<P>FLORRY Dreams go by contraries.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Extending his arms</I>.) It was here. Street of harlots.

In Serpentine Avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the

red carpet spread?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Approaching Stephen</I>.) Look.



<P>STEPHEN No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without

end. (<I>He cries.) Pater!</I> Free!



<P>BLOOM I say, look...



<P>STEPHEN Break my spirit, will he? <I>O merde alors! (He cries, his vulture

talons sharpened</I>.) Hola! Hillyho!



<P>(<I>Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready</I>.)



<P>SIMON That's all right. (<I>He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling,

uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings</I>.) Ho,

boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes.

Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying!

Hai, boy!



<P>(<I>The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country.

A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother,

runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves.

The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry,

beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen

live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile

Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters

with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey

negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players,

thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard

hats clamour deafeningly</I>.)

<P>LYNCH (<I>Handing her coins</I>.) Here.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Cracking his fingers impatiently</I>.) Quick! Quick! Where's

my augur's rod? (<I>He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating

his foot in tripudium</I>.)



<P>ZOE (<I>Turns the drumhandle</I>.) There.



<P>(<I>She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start

forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin,

in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape,

bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering.

He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of

arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing</I>.)



<P>ZOE (<I>Twirls around herself heeltapping</I>.) Dance. Anybody here

for there? Who'll dance?



<P>(<I>The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude

to</I> My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. <I>Stephen throws his ashplant on the

table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table

towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins

to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals

a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains,

Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat.

With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates

in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream

tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight

lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is

a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges

it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows

and fondles his flower and buttons</I>.)



<P>MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with

Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment.

The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (<I>He

minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant!

R&eacute;v&eacute;rence! Tout le monde en place!</I>



<P><I>(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels,

shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz

time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade,

gold, rose, violet</I>.)



<P>THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls,

girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.



<P>(<I>From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish

blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their

skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked,

high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting

their arms</I>.)



<P>MAGINNI (<I>Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr&eacute;! Avant deux!</I>

Breathe evenly! <I>Balance!</I>



<P><I>(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing

to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cawaliers behind

them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising

from their shoulders</I>.)



<P>HOURS You may touch my.



<P>CAVALIERS May I touch your?



<P>HOURS O, but lightly!



<P>CAVALIERS O, so lightly!



<P>THE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.



<P>(<I>Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours

advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their

cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze

with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze</I>.)



<P>MAGINNI <I>Avant! huit! Travers&eacute;! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois&eacute;!</I>



<P><I>(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight

hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets

of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils</I>.)



<P>THE BRACELETS Heigho! Heigho!



<P>ZOE (<I>Twisting, her hand to her brow.)</I> O!



<P>MAGINNI<I> Los tiroirs! Cha&icirc;ne de dames! La corbeille! Dos &agrave;

<P><I>(Arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving,

unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling</I>.)



<P>ZOE I'm giddy.



<P>(<I>She frees herself droops on a chair, Stephen seizes Florry and turns

with her</I>.)



<P>MAGINNI <I>Boulang&egrave;re! Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois!

Escargots!</I>



<P><I>(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link,

each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn

<P>STEPHEN Ho!



<P>(<I>Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper

grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her

face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank.

(<I>From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress

of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at

her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand</I>.)



<P>BUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the

afflicted mother. (<I>He upturns his eyes</I>.) Mercurial Malachi.



<P>THE MOTHER (<I>With the subtle smile of death's madness</I>.) I was

once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Horrorstruck</I>.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's

trick is this?



<P>BUCK MULLIGAN (<I>Shakes his curling capbell</I>.) The mockery of it!

Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (<I>Tears of

<I>Epi oinopa ponton</I>.



<P>THE MOTHER (<I>Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of

wetted ashes</I>.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men

in the world. You too. Time will come.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Choking with fright, remorse and horror</I>.) They said

I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.



<P>THE MOTHER (<I>A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth</I>.)

You sang that song to me. <I>Love's bitter mystery</I>.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Eagerly</I>.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now.

The word known to all men.



<P>THE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey

with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers?

Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline

manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.



<P>STEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!



<P>THE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that

boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved

you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.



<P>ZOE (<I>Fanning herself with the grate fan</I>.) I'm melting!



<P>FLORRY (<I>Points to Stephen</I>) Look! He's white.

<P>THE MOTHER (<I>Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen

breath</I>.) Beware! (<I>She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly

Sacred Heart!



<P>STEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring

you all to heel!



<P>THE MOTHER (<I>In the agony of her deathrattle</I>.) Have mercy on Stephen,

grief and agony on Mount Calvary.

<BR>BELLA (<I>Screams</I>.) After him!



<P>(<I>The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede

from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns</I>.)



<P>THE WHORES (<I>Jammed in the doorway, pointing</I>.) Down there.



<P>ZOE (<I>Pointing</I>.) There. There's something up.



<P>BELLA Who pays for the lamp? (<I>She seizes Bloom's coattail</I>.) There.

You were with him. The lamp's broken.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Rushes to the hall, rushes back</I>.) What lamp, woman?



<P>A WHORE He tore his coat.



<P>BELLA (<I>Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points</I>.) Who's

to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Snatches up Stephen's ashplant</I>.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't

you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...



<P>BELLA (<I>Loudly</I>.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel.

A ten shilling house.



<P>BLOOM (<I>His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet

lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant</I>.) Only

the chimney's broken. Here is all he...



<P>BELLA (<I>Shrinks back and screams</I>.) Jesus! Don't!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Warding off a blow</I>.) To show you how he hit the paper.

There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!



<P>FLORRY (<I>With a glass of water enters</I>.) Where is he?



<P>BELLA Do you want me to call the police?



<P>BLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student.

Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (<I>He makes

a masonic sign</I>.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You

don't want a scandal.



<P>BELLA (<I>Angrily</I>.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the

boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he?

I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (<I>She shouts</I>.) Zoe! Zoe!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Urgently</I>.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (<I>Warningly</I>.)

I know.



<P>BELLA (<I>Almost speechless</I>.) Who are you incog?



<P>ZOE (<I>In the doorway</I>.) There's a row on.



<P>BLOOM What? Where? (He throws <I>a shilling on the table and shouts</I>.)

That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (<I>He hurries out

through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from

her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly,

pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives

a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the

halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car

with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall

uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher

replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey.

Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his

caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face.

Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens

on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him,

torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack

of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho

cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the

scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their

tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags,

gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes,

eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound,

<P>STEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.

<BR>VOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's.

What's up? Soldiers and civilians.



<P>CISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to

do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the

man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.

<P>CISSY CAFFREY (<I>To the crowd</I>.) No, I was with the private.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Amiably</I>.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion

every lady for example...



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>His cap awry, advancing to Stephen</I>.) Say, how would

it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Looks up in the sky</I>.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art

of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (<I>He waves his hand</I>)

<P>(<I>To Cissy Caffrey</I>.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?



<P>DOLLY GRAY (<I>From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign

<P>BLOOM (<I>Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously</I>.)

Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Turns</I>.) Eh? (<I>He disengages himself</I>) Why should

I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate

orange? (<I>He points his finger</I>.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk

to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.



<P>(<I>He staggers a pace back</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Propping him</I>.) Retain your own.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Laughs emptily</I>.) My centre of gravity is displaced.

I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle

for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar

and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (<I>He taps his brow</I>.)

But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.



<P>BIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor

out of the college.



<P>CUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.



<P>BIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.



<P>CUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Pulls himself free and comes forward</I>.) What's that

you're saying about my king?



<P>(<I>Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey

on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of

Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns'

horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company

of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect

and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his

left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed:</I> D&eacute;fense

d'uriner. <I>A roar of welcome greets him</I>.)



<P>EDWARD THE SEVENTH (<I>Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly</I>.) Peace,

perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (<I>He

turns to his subjects</I>.) We have come here to witness a clean straight

fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar

a back.



<P>(<I>He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom

and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously

in acknowledgement</I>.)



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>To Stephen</I>.) Say it again.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up</I>.) I understand your

point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the

age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is

the point. You die for your country, suppose. (<I>He places his arm on

Private Carr's sleeve</I>.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let

my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it

to die. Damn death. Long live life!

<P>BLOOM (<I>To the privates, softly</I>.) He doesn't know what he's saying.

Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster.

I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Nods, smiling and laughing</I>.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar

and judge of impostors.

<P>STEPHEN (<I>Throws up his hands</I>.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing.

He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some

brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (<I>He searches his pockets vaguely</I>.)

Gave it to someone.



<P>PRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Tries to move off</I>.) Will some one tell me where I am

least likely to meet these necessary evils? <I>&ccedil;a se voit aussi

&agrave; Paris</I>. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...



<P>(<I>The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears

seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast</I>.)



<P>STEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that

eats her farrow!



<P>OLD GUMMY GRANNY (<I>Rocking to and fro</I>.) Ireland's sweetheart,

the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners

to them! (<I>She keens with banshee woe</I>.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the

kine! (<I>She wails</I>.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she

stand?



<P>STEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person

of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.



<P>CISSY CAFFREY (<I>Shrill</I>.) Stop them from fighting!



<P>A ROUGH Our men retreated.



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Tugging at his belt</I>.) I'll wring the neck of any

bugger says a word against my fucking king.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Terrified</I>.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.



<P>THE CITIZEN <I>Erin go bragh!</I>



<P>(<I>Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations,

trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility</I>.)



<P>PRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.



<P>STEPHEN Did I? When?



<P>BLOOM (<I>To the redcoats</I>.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish

missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by

our monarch.



<P>THE NAVVY (<I>Staggering past</I>.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the

kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!



<P>(<I>Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted

spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin

cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons

and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives

the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars</I>.)



<P>MAJOR TWEEDY (<I>Growls gruffly</I>.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and

at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.



<P>PRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.



<P>PRIVATE COMPTON (<I>Waves the crowd back</I>.) Fair play, here. Make

a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.



<P>(<I>Massed bands blare</I> Garryowen <I>and</I> God save the king.)



<P>CISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!



<P>CUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.



<P>BIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.



<P>CUNTY KATE (<I>Blushing deeply</I>.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and

merry Saint George for me!



<P>STEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's

windingsheet.



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Loosening his belt, shouts</I>.) I'll wring the neck

of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders</I>.) Speak, you! Are you

struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman,

sacred lifegiver.



<P>CISSY CAFFREY (<I>Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with

you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries</I>.) Police!



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey</I>.)

VOICES Police!



<P>DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!



<P>(<I>Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling

guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse

commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns

hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves

rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands,

swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks,

climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls,

albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles.

The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats

and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with

a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches,

arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the

void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes

they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy

clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts

above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty

sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters.

It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange

in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry

sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel

O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell,

Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny,

lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of

the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre

of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise

from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower

two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone

Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice

resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat

and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates

camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and

mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants

head an open umbrella</I>.)



<P>FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN <I>Introibo ad altare diaboli</I>.



<P>THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young

days.



<P>FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (<I>Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping

host.) Corpus Meum</I>.



<P>THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (<I>Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats,

revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck</I>.)

My body.



<P>THE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!



<P>(<I>From on high the voice of Adonai calls</I>.)



<P>ADONAI Dooooooooooog!



<P>THE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!



<P>(<I>From on high the voice of Adonai calls</I>.)



<P>ADONAI Goooooooooood!



<P>(<I>In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions

sing</I> Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>With ferocious articulation</I>.) I'll do him in, so

help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted

fucking windpipe!



<P>OLD GUMMY GRANNY (<I>Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand</I>.) Remove

him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free.

(<I>She prays</I>.) O good God, take him!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Runs to Lynch</I>.) Can't you get him away?



<P>LYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (<I>To Bloom</I>.)

Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (<I>He drags Kitty away</I>.)



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit</I>.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Runs to Stephen</I>.) Come along with me now before worse

happens. Here's your stick.



<P>STEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.



<P>CISSY CAFFREY (<I>Pulling Private Carr</I>.) Come on, you're boosed.

He insulted me but I forgive him. (<I>Shouting in his ear</I>.) I forgive

him for insulting me.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Over Stephen's shoulder</I>.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Breaks loose.)</I> I'll insult him.



<P>(<I>He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in

the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his

face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it

up</I>.)



<P>MAJOR TWEEDY (<I>Loudly</I>.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!



<P>THE RETRIEVER (<I>Barking furiously</I>.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.



<P>THE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The

soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's

fainted!



<P>(<I>The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily</I>.)



<P>What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence?

Let them go and fight the Boers!



<P>THE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with

his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.



<P>(<I>They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit</I>.)



<P>THE RETRIEVER (<I>Barking</I>.) Wow wow wow.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Shoves them back, loudly</I>.) Get back, stand back!



<P>PRIVATE COMPTON (<I>Tugging his comrade</I>.) Here bugger off, Harry.

There's the cops!



<P>(<I>Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group</I>)



<P>FIRST WATCH What's wrong here?



<P>PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted

my chum. (<I>The retriever barks</I>.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?



<P>CISSY CAFFREY (<I>With expectation</I>.) Is he bleeding?



<P>A MAN (<I>Rising from his knees</I>.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all

right.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Glances sharply at the man</I>.) Leave him to me. I can easily...



<P>SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Lurches towards the watch</I>.) He insulted my lady

friend.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Angrily</I>.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness.

Constable, take his regimental number.



<P>SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty.

PRIVATE COMPTON (<I>Pulling his comrade</I>.) Here, bugger off, Harry.

Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Staggering as he is pulled away</I>.) God fuck old

Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.



<P>FIRST WATCH (<I>Taking out his notebook</I>.) What's his name?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Peering over the crowd</I>.) I just see a car there. If you

give me a hand a second, sergeant.



<P>FIRST WATCH Name and address.



<P>(<I>Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand,

appears among the bystanders</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Quickly</I>.) O, the very man! (<I>He whispers</I>.) Simon

Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.



<P>SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.



<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>To the watch, with drawling eye</I>.) That's all

right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (<I>He

laughs</I>.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?



<P>FIRST WATCH (<I>Turns to the crowd</I>.) Here, what are you all gaping

at? Move on out of that.



<P>(<I>The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane</I>.)



<P>CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (<I>He

laughs, shaking his head</I>.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse.

What? Eh, what?



<P>FIRST WATCH (<I>Laughs</I>.) I suppose so.



<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Nudges the second watch</I>.) Come and wipe your

name off the slate. (<I>He lilts, wagging his head</I>.) With my tooraloom

tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?



<P>SECOND WATCH (<I>Genially</I>.) Ah, sure we were too.



<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Winking</I>.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round

there.



<P>SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.



<P>CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn</I>.) Thank you

very much gentlemen, thank you. (<I>He mumbles confidentially</I>.) We

don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly

respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.



<P>FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.



<P>SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.



<P>FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to

report it at the station.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Nods rapidly</I>.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden

duty.



<P>SECOND WATCH It's our duty.



<P>CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.



<P>THE WATCH (<I>Saluting together</I>.) Night, gentlemen. (<I>They move

off with slow heavy tread</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Blows</I>.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a

car?.



<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder

to the car brought up against the scaffolding</I>.) Two commercials that

were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two

quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly

girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.



<P>BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...



<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Laughs</I>.) Sure they wanted me to join in with

the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself.

(<I>He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye</I>.) Thanks be to God

we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Tries to laugh</I>.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was

just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor

fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and

I was just making my way home...



<P>(<I>The horse neighs</I>.)



<P>THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!



<P>CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after

we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and

got off to see. (<I>He laughs</I>.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will

I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?



<P>BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.



<P>(<I>Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls

at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down</I>.)



<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Scratches his nape</I>.) Sandycove! (<I>He bends

down and calls to Stephen</I>.) Eh! (<I>He calls again</I>.) Eh! He's covered

with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.



<P>BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.



<P>CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll

shove along. (<I>He laughs</I>.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying

the dead. Safe home!



<P>THE HORSE (<I>Neighs</I>.) Hohohohohome.



<P>BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...



<P>(<I>Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse

harness jingles</I>.)



<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>From the car, standing</I>.) Night.



<P>BLOOM Night.



<P>(<I>The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The

car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat

sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey

joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom

shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher

reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what

else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that

is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner

of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand.

Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay.

The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo

lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and

ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the

shoulder</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Eh! Ho! (<I>There is no answer he bends again</I>.) Mr Dedalus!

(<I>There is no answer</I>.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (<I>He

bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate

form</I>.) Stephen! (<I>There is no answer. He calls again</I>.) Stephen!



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Groans</I>.) Who? Black panther vampire. (<I>He sighs and

stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) </I>Who...

drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...



<P>(<I>He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (<I>He bends again and undoes the

buttons of Stephen's waistcoat</I>.) To breathe. (<I>He brushes the wood

shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers</I>.) One

pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (<I>He listens</I>.) What!



<P>(<I>Murmurs</I>.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>... shadows... the woods

<BR>... white breast... dim...</BLOCKQUOTE>

(<I>He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding

his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens

and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and

form</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Communes with the night</I>.) Face reminds me of his poor

mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught.

A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (<I>He murmurs</I>.)...

swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or

parts, art or arts... (<I>He murmurs</I>.) in the rough sands of the sea.

a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...



<P>(<I>Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his

lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears

slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton

suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his

hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly</I>.) Rudy!



<P>RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing,

smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby

buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet

howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)

INELUCTABLE MODALITY OF THE VISIBLE: AT LEAST THAT IF NO MORE, thought

through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and

seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust:

coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then he

was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his

sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, <I>maestro

di color che sanno</I>. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane.

If you can put your five fingers through it, it is a gate, if not a door.

Shut your eyes and see.



<P>Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and

shells. You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a time.

A very short space of time through very short times of space. Five, six:

the <I>nacheinander</I>. Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality

of the audible. Open your eyes. No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that

beetles o'er his base, fell through the <I>nebeneinander</I> ineluctably.

I am getting on nicely in the dark. My ash sword hangs at my side. Tap

with it: they do. My two feet in his boots are at the end of his legs,

<I>nebeneinander</I>. Sounds solid: made by the mallet of <I>Los Demiurgos</I>.

Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand? Crush, crack, crick,

crick. Wild sea money. Dominie Deasy kens them a'.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Won't you come to Sandymount,

<BR>Madeline the mare?</BLOCKQUOTE>

Rhythm begins, you see. I hear. A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.

No, agallop: <I>deline the mare</I>.



<P>Open your eyes now. I will. One moment. Has all vanished since? If I

open and am for ever in the black adiaphane. <I>Basta!</I> I will see if

I can see.



<P>See now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without

end.



<P>They came down the steps from Leahy's terrace prudently, <I>Frauenzimmer</I>:

and down the shelving shore flabbily their splayed feet sinking in the

silted sand. Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother. Number

one swung lourdily her midwife's bag, the other's gamp poked in the beach.

From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the

late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street. One of her sisterhood

lugged me squealing into life. Creation from nothing. What has she in the

bag? A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool. The cords

of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh. That is why mystic

monks. Will you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos. Hello. Kinch here. Put

me on to Edenville. Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.



<P>Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve. She had no navel.

Gaze. Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no,

whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting.

Womb of sin.



<P>Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten. By them, the man

with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath. They

clasped and sundered, did the coupler's will. From before the ages He willed

me and now may not will me away or ever <I>A lex eterna</I> stays about

him. Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial?

Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions? Warring his life long on the

contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality. Illstarred heresiarch. In a Greek

watercloset he breathed his last: euthanasia. With beaded mitre and with

crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed

omophorion, with clotted hinderparts.



<P>Airs romped around him, nipping and eager airs. They are coming, waves.

The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of Mananaan.



<P>I mustn't forget his letter for the press. And after? The Ship, half

twelve. By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.

Yes, I must.



<P>His pace slackened. Here. Am I going to Aunt Sara's or not? My consubstantial

father's voice. Did you see anything of your artist brother Stephen lately?

No? Sure he's not down in Strasburg terrace with his aunt Sally? Couldn't

he fly a bit higher than that, eh? And and and and tell us Stephen, how

is uncle Si? O weeping God, the things I married into. De boys up in de

hayloft. The drunken little costdrawer and his brother, the cornet player.

Highly respectable gondoliers. And skeweyed Walter sirring his father,

no less. Sir. Yes, sir. No, sir. Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ.



<P>I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait. They take

me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.



<P>-- It's Stephen, sir.



<P>-- Let him in. Let Stephen in.



<P>A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.



<P>-- We thought you were someone else.



<P>In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over

the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm. Cleanchested. He has washed

the upper moiety.



<P>-- Morrow, nephew.



<P>He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for

the eyes of Master Goff and Master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and

common searches and a writ of <I>Duces Tecum</I>. A bogoak frame over his

bald head: Wilde's <I>Requiescat</I>. The drone of his misleading whistle

brings Walter back.



<P>-- Yes, sir?



<P>-- Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. Where is she?



<P>-- Bathing Crissie, sir.



<P>Papa's little bedpal. Lump of love.



<P>-- No, uncle Richie...



<P>-- Call me Richie. Damn your lithia water. It lowers. Whusky!



<P>-- Uncle Richie, really...



<P>-- Sit down or by the law Harry I'll knock you down.



<P>Walter squints vainly for a chair.



<P>-- He has nothing to sit down on, sir.



<P>-- He has nowhere to put it, you mug. Bring in our Chippendale chair.

Would you like a bite of something? None of your damned lawdeedaw air here;

the rich of a rasher fried with a herring? Sure? So much the better. We

have nothing in the house but backache pills.



<P><I>All'erta!</I>



<P>He drones bars of Ferrando's <I>aria de sortita</I>. The grandest number,

Stephen, in the whole opera. Listen.



<P>His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the

air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.



<P>This wind is sweeter.



<P>Houses of decay, mine, his and all. You told the Clongowes gentry you

had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. Come out of them,

Stephen. Beauty is not there. Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh's library

where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. For whom? The hundredheaded

rabble of the cathedral close. A hater of his kind ran from them to the

wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs stars. Houyhnhnm,

horsenostrilled. The oval equine faces. Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell.

Lantern jaws. Abbas father, furious dean, what offence laid fire to their

brains? Paff! <I>Descende, calve, ut ne nimium decalveris</I>. A garland

of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace

(<I>descende</I>), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed. Get down, bald

poll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar's horns,

the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and

oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.



<P>And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating

it. Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx. Dringadring!

And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek. Dringdringl

Down, up, forward, back. Dan Occam thought of that, invincible doctor.

A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled his brain. Bringing

his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his second bell the first

bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and, rising, heard (now I am lifting)

their two bells (he is kneeling) twang in diphthong.



<P>Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were

awfully holy, weren't you? You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might

not have a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that

the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet

street. <I>O si, certo!</I> Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned

round a squaw. More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth tram alone

crying to the rain: <I>naked women!</I> What about that, eh?



<P>What about what? What else were they invented for?



<P>Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh? I was young.

You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly,

striking face. Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one saw: tell no-one.

Books you were going to write with letters for titles. Have you read his

F? O yes, but I prefer Q. Yes, but W is wonderful. O yes, W. Remember your

epiphanies on green oval leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you

died to all the great libraries of the world, including Alexandria? Someone

was to read them there after a few thousand year, a mahamanvantara. Pico

della Mirandola like. Ay, very like a whale. When one reads these strange

pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who once...



<P>The grainy sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod again a

damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the unnumbered

pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada. Unwholesome sandflats

waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath. He coasted

them, walking warily. A porter-bottle stood up, stogged to its waist, in

the cakey sand dough. A sentinel: isle of dreadful thirst. Broken hoops

on the shore; at the land a maze of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled

backdoors and on the higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts.

Ringsend: wigwams of brown steersmen and master mariners. Human shells.



<P>He halted. I have passed the way to aunt Sara's. Am I not going there?

Seems not. No-one about. He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand

towards the Pigeonhouse.



<P>-- <I>Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?</I>



<P>-- <I>C'est le pigeon, Joseph</I>.



<P>Patrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar MacMahon.

Son of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris. My father's a bird, he lapped

the sweet <I>lait chaud</I> with pink young tongue, plump bunny's face.

Lap, <I>lapin</I>. He hopes to win in the <I>gros lots</I>. About the nature

of women he read in Michelet. But he must send me <I>La Vie de J&eacute;sus</I>

by M. Leo Taxil. Lent it to his friend.



<P>-- <I>C'est tordant, vows savez. Moi je suis socialiste. Je ne crois

pas en l'existence de Dieu. Faut pas le dire &agrave; mon p&egrave;re</I>.



<P>-- <I>Il croit?</I>



<P>-- <I>Mon p&egrave;re, oui</I>.



<P><I>Schluss</I>. He laps.



<P>My Latin quarter hat. God, we simply must dress the character. I want

puce gloves. You were a student, weren't you? Of what in the other devil's

name? Paysayenn. P. C. N., you know: <I>physiques, chimiques et naturelles</I>.

Aha. Eating your groatsworth of <I>mou en civet</I>, fleshpots of Egypt,

elbowed by belching cabmen. Just say in the most natural tone: when I was

in Paris, <I>boul' Mich</I>', I used to. Yes, used to carry punched tickets

to prove an alibi if they arrested you for murder somewhere. Justice. On

the night of the seventeenth of February 1904 the prisoner was seen by

two witnesses. Other fellow did it: other me. Hat, tie, overcoat, nose.

<I>Lui, c'est moi</I>. You seem to have enjoyed yourself.



<P>Proudly walking. Whom were you trying to walk like? Forget: a dispossessed.

With mother's money order, eight shillings, the banging door of the post

office slammed in your face by the usher. Hunger toothache. <I>Encore deux

minutes</I>. Look clock. Must get. <I>Ferm&eacute;</I>. Hired dog! Shoot

him to bloody bits with a bang shotgun, bits man spattered walls all brass

buttons. Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack back. Not hurt? O, that's all

right. Shake hands. See what I meant, see? O, that's all right. Shake a

shake. O, that's all only all right.



<P>You were going to do wonders, what? Missionary to Europe after fiery

Columbanus. Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt from

their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: <I>Euge! Euge!</I> Pretending to speak

broken English as you dragged your valise, porter threepence, across the

slimy pier at Newhaven. <I>Comment?</I> Rich booty you brought back; <I>Le

Tutu</I>, five tattered numbers of <I>Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge</I>,

a blue French telegram, curiosity to show:



<P>-- Mother dying come home father.



<P>The aunt thinks you killed your mother. That's why she won't.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Then here's a health to Mulligan's aunt

<BR>And I'll tell you the reason why.

<BR>She always kept things decent in

<BR>The Hannigan famileye.</BLOCKQUOTE>

His feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along by

the boulders of the south wall. He stared at them proudly, piled stone

mammoth skulls. Gold light on sea, on sand, on boulders. The sun is there,

the slender trees, the lemon houses.



<P>Paris rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Moist pith

of farls of bread, the froggreen wormwood, her matin incense, court the

air. Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife's lover's wife, the kerchiefed

housewife is astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hands. In Rodot's Yvonne

and Madeleine newmake their tumbled beauties, shattering with gold teeth

<I>chaussons</I> of pastry, their mouths yellowed with the <I>pus of flan

breton</I>. Faces of Paris men go by, their wellpleased pleasers, curled

conquistadores.



<P>Noon slumbers. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers

smeared with printer's ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his white.

About us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets. <I>Un demi setier!</I>

A jet of coffee steam from the burnished caldron. She serves me at his

beck. <I>Il est irlandais. Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux irlandais, nous,

Irlande, vous savez? Ah oui!</I> She thought you wanted a cheese <I>hollandais</I>.

Your postprandial, do you know that word? Postprandial. There was a fellow

I knew once in Barcelona, queer fellow, used to call it his postprandial.

Well: <I>slainte!</I> Around the slabbed tables the tangle of wined breaths

and grumbling gorges. His breath hangs over our saucestained plates, the

green fairy's fang thrusting between his lips. Of Ireland, the Dalcassians,

of hopes, conspiracies, of Arthur Griffith now. To yoke me as his yokefellow,

our crimes our common cause. You're your father's son. I know the voice.

His fustian shirt, sanguineflowered, trembles its Spanish tassels at his

secrets. M. Drumont, famous journalist, Drumont, know what he called queen

Victoria? Old hag with the yellow teeth. <I>Vieille ogresse</I> with the

<I>dents jaunes</I>. Maud Gonne, beautiful woman, <I>La Patrie</I>, M.

Millevoye, F&eacute;lix Faure, know how he died? Licentious men. The froeken,

<I>bonne &agrave; tout faire</I>, who rubs male nakedness in the bath at

Upsala. <I>Moi faire</I>, she said. <I>Tous les messieurs</I>. Not this

<I>Monsieur</I>, I said. Most licentious custom. Bath a most private thing.

I wouldn't let my brother, not even my own brother, most lascivious thing.

Green eyes, I see you. Fang, I feel. Lascivious people.



<P>The blue fuse burns deadly between hands and burns clear. Loose tobacco

shreds catch fire: a flame and acrid smoke light our corner. Raw facebones

under his peep of day boy's hat. How the head centre got away, authentic

version. Got up as a young bride, man, veil orangeblossoms, drove out the

road to Malahide. Did, faith. Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes.

Disguises, clutched at, gone, not here.



<P>Spurned lover. I was a strapping young gossoon at that time, I tell

you, I'll show you my likeness one day. I was, faith. Lover, for her love

he prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under the walls

of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward

in the fog. Shattered glass and toppling masonry. In gay Paree he hides,

Egan of Paris, unsought by any save by me. Making his day's stations, the

dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the Montmartre lair he sleeps short

night in, rue de la Goutte-d'Or, damascened with flyblown faces of the

gone. Loveless, landless, wifeless. She is quite nicey comfy without her

outcastman, madame, in rue G&icirc;t-le-Coeur, canary and two buck lodgers.

Peachy cheeks, a zebra skirt, frisky as a young thing's. Spurned and undespairing.

Tell Pat you saw me, won't you? I wanted to get poor Pat a job one time.

<I>Mon fils</I>, soldier of France. I taught him to sing. <I>The boys of

Kilkenny are stout roaring blades</I>. Know that old lay? I taught Patrice

that. Old Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow's castle on the Nore. Goes

like this. <I>O, O.</I> He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.

<BLOCKQUOTE>O, O the boys of

<BR>Kilkenny...</BLOCKQUOTE>

Weak wasting hand on mine. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them.

Remembering thee, O Sion.



<P>He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.

The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of seeds

of brightness. Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I?

He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil.

Turn back.



<P>Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in

new sockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the barbicans

the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking,

creeping duskward over the dial floor. Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue

night. In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs,

my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters. Who to clear it?

He has the key. I will not sleep there when this night comes. A shut door

of a silent tower entombing their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his

pointer. Call: no answer. He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned

back by the mole of boulders. Take all, keep all. My soul walks with me,

form of forms. So in the moon's midwatches I pace the path above the rocks,

in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore's tempting flood.



<P>The flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back

then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there. He climbed over the sedge

and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a

grike.



<P>A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack. Before him the

gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. <I>Un coche ensabl&eacute;</I>, Louis

Veuillot called Gautier's prose. These heavy sands are language tide and

wind have silted here. And there, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren

of weasel rats. Hide gold there. Try it. You have some. Sands and stones.

Heavy of the past. Sir Lout's toys. Mind you don't get one bang on the

ear. I'm the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones

for my steppingstones. Feefawfum. I zmellz de bloods odz an Iridzman.



<P>A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.

Lord, is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not be master

of others or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight. From farther away,

walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two. The two maries.

They have tucked it safe among the bulrushes. Peekaboo. I see you. No,

the dog. He is running back to them. Who?



<P>Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their

bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter sun. Danevikings, torcs

of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of

gold. A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling

in the shallows. Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined

dwarfs, my people, with flayers' knives, running, scaling, hacking in green

blubbery whalemeat. Famine, plague and slaughters. Their blood is in me,

their lusts my waves. I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I,

a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none

to me.



<P>The dog's bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. Dog of my enemy.

I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about. <I>Terribilia meditans</I>.

A primrose doublet, fortune's knave, smiled on my fear. For that are you

pining, the bark of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives. The Bruce's

brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York's false

scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert

Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned. All kings'

sons. Paradise of pretenders then and now. He saved men from drowning and

you shake at a cur's yelping. But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or

san Michele were in their own house. House of... We don't want any of your

medieval abstrusiosities. Would you do what he did? A boat would be near,

a lifebuoy. <I>Nat&uuml;rlich</I>, put there for you. Would you or would

you not? The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden's rock. They

are waiting for him now. The truth, spit it out. I would want to. I would

try. I am not a strong swimmer. Water cold soft. When I put my face into

it in the basin at Clongowes. Can't see! Who's behind me? Out quickly,

quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting

the lows of sands quickly, shell cocoacoloured? If I had land under my

feet I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine. A drowning man.

His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death. I... With him together

down... I could not save her. Waters: bitter death: lost.



<P>A woman and a man. I see her skirties. Pinned up, I bet.



<P>Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing

on all sides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made

off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming

gull. The man's shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He turned, bounded

back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a field tenney a buck,

trippant, proper, unattired. At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with

stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise,

herds of seamorse. They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling

many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out,

waves and waves.



<P>Cocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused

their bags, and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped running

to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared

up at them with mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept by them as they

came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf's tongue redpanting from his

jaws. His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf's

gallop. The carcass lay on his path. He stopped, sniffed, stalked round

it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffing rapidly like a dog

all over the dead dog's bedraggled fell. Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the

ground, moves to one great goal. Ah, poor dogsbody. Here lies poor dogsbody's

body.



<P>-- Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel.



<P>The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless

kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He slunk

back in a curve. Doesn't see me. Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped,

dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it.

He trotted forward and, lifting his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt

rock. The simple pleasures of the poor. His hindpaws then scattered sand:

then his forepaws dabbled and delved. Something he buried there, his grandmother.

He rooted in the sand, dabbling delving and stopped to listen to the air,

scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard,

a panther, got in spouse-breach, vulturing the dead.



<P>After he woke me up last night same dream or was it? Wait. Open hallway.

Street of harlots. Remember. Haroun al Raschid. I am almosting it. That

man led me, spoke. I was not afraid. The melon he had he held against my

face. Smiled: creamfruit smell. That was the rule, said. In. Come. Red

carpet spread. You will see who.



<P>Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians. His blued feet

out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler

strangling his unshaven neck. With woman steps she followed: the ruffian

and his strolling mort. Spoils slung at her back. Loose sand and shellgrit

crusted her bare feet. About her windraw face her hair trailed. Behind

her lord his helpmate, bing awast, to Romeville. When night hides her body's

flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired.

Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O'Loughlin's of Blackpitts.

Buss her, wap in rogue's rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell. A shefiend's

whiteness under her rancid rags. Fumbally's lane that night: the tanyard

smells.

<BLOCKQUOTE>White thy fambles, red thy gan

<BR>And thy quarrons dainty is.

<BR>Couch a hogshead with me then.

<BR>In the darkmans clip and kiss.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, <I>frate porcospino</I>.

Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted. Call away let him: <I>thy quarrons dainty

is</I>. Language no whit worse than his. Monkwords, marybeads jabber on

their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.



<P>Passing now.



<P>A side-eye at my Hamlet hat. If I were suddenly naked here as I sit

I am not. Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun's flaming

sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. She trudges, schlepps, trains,

drags, trascines her load. A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake. Tides,

myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, <I>oinopa ponton</I>, a winedark

sea. Behold the handmaid of the moon. In sleep the wet sign calls her hour,

bids her rise. Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled. <I>Omnis

caro ad te veniet</I>. He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes,

his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth's kiss.



<P>Here. Put a pin in that chap, will you? My tablets. Mouth to her kiss.

No. Must be two of em. Glue 'em well. Mouth to her mouth's kiss.



<P>His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her womb.

Oomb, allwombing tomb. His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah:

roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayawayaway.

Paper. The banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy's letter. Here. Thanking you

for hospitality tear the blank end off. Turning his back to the sun he

bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words. That's twice I forgot

to take slips from the library counter.



<P>His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till

the farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining

in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there with his

augur's rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld,

in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars. I throw this

ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back. Endless, would

it be mine, form of my form? Who watches me here? Who ever anywhere will

read these written words? Signs on a white field. Somewhere to someone

in your flutiest voice. The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the

temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched

on its field. Hold hard. Coloured on a flat: yes, that's right. Flat I

see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back. Ah, see now.

Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope. Click does the trick. You find

my words dark. Darkness is in our souls, do you not think? Flutier. Our

souls, shame-wounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her

lover clinging, the more the more.



<P>She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the blue

hell am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality of

the ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at Hodges

Figgis' window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were

going to write. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through the braided jess

of her sunshade. She lives in Leeson park, with a grief and kickshaws,

a lady of letters. Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup. Bet she

wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned

with lumpy wool. Talk about apple dumplings, <I>piuttosto</I>. Where are

your wits?



<P>Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch

me soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone.

Sad too. Touch, touch me.



<P>He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled

note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes. That is

Kevin Egan's movement I made nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep. <I>Et

vidit Deus. Et erant valde bona</I>. Alo! <I>Bonjour</I>, welcome as the

flowers in May. Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes

the southing sun. I am caught in this burning scene. Pan's hour, the faunal

noon. Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny

waters leaves lie wide. Pain is far.



<P><I>And no more turn aside and brood</I>.



<P>His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck's castoffs <I>nebeneinander:</I>

He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another's foot had nested

warm. The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove. But you

were delighted when Esther Osvalt's shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.

<I>Tiens, quel petit pied!</I> Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde's

love that dare not speak its name. He now will leave me. And the blame?

As I am. As I am. All or not at all.



<P>In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering greengoldenly

lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float away. I shall

wait. No, they will pass on, passing chafing against the low rocks, swirling,

passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a fourworded wavespeech:

seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes,

rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded

in barrels. And, spent, its speech ceases. It flows purling, widely flowing,

floating foampool, flower unfurling.



<P>Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and

sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying

and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded

and let fall. Lord, they are weary: and, whispered to, they sigh. Saint

Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness

of their times, <I>diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit</I>.

To no end gathered: vainly then released, forth flowing, wending back:

loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked

woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.



<P>Five fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one he

said. Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a loose

drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. A corpse rising saltwhite

from the undertow, bobbing landward, a pace a pace a porpoise. There he

is. Hook it quick. Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor. We have

him. Easy now.



<P>Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of

a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly. God

becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.

Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal

from all dead. Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench

of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.



<P>A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths

known to man. Old Father Ocean. <I>Prix de Paris</I>: beware of imitations.

Just you give it a fair trial. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.



<P>Come. I thirst. Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there?

Thunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, <I>Lucifer,

dico, qui nescit occasum</I>. No. My cockle hat and staff and his my sandal

shoon. Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.



<P>He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.

Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make their end.

By the way next when is it? Tuesday will be the longest day. Of all the

glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn Tennyson, gentleman

poet. <I>Gi&agrave;</I>. For the old hag with the yellow teeth. And Monsieur

Drumont, gentleman journalist. <I>Gi&agrave;</I>. My teeth are very bad.

Why, I wonder? Feel. That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to a dentist,

I wonder, with that money? That one. Toothless Kinch, the superman. Why

is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?



<P>My handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?



<P>His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn't. Better buy one.



<P>He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully.

For the rest let look who will.



<P>Behind. Perhaps there is someone.



<P>He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the

air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees,

homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.

THE SUMMER EVENING HAD BEGUN TO FOLD THE WORLD IN ITS mysterious embrace.

Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting

day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear

old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks

along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence

there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to

her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the storm-tossed heart

of man, Mary, star of the sea.



<P>The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening

scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and oft

were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat

beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey

and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey,

two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match

and the name H.M.S. Belleisle printed on both. For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey

were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes

but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing

ways about them. They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets,

building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball,

happy as the day was long. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby

to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with

delight. He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a

tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy

Caffrey bent over him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple

in his chin.



<P>-- Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of

water.



<P>And baby prattled after her:



<P>-- A jink a jink a jawbo. Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she

was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy

Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey

that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf of brown

bread with golden syrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But

to be sure baby was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy

bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.

A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh

in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips,

a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint

language of little brother.



<P>But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and

Master Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to

this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which

Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that

it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello

tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled

too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman's house is his castle,

he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the would be assailant

came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too. Needless to

say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl

friends.



<P>-- Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively, at once! And you,

Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch

you for that.



<P>His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their

big sister's word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was after

his misadventure. His little man-o'-war top and unmentionables were full

of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life's

tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on

his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears

that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at

Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn't be far

from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.



<P>-- Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.



<P>She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:



<P>-- What's your name? Butter and cream?



<P>-- Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your

sweetheart?



<P>-- Nao, tearful Tommy said.



<P>-- Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.



<P>-- Nao, Tommy said.



<P>-- I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from

her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy's sweetheart, Gerty is Tommy's

sweetheart.



<P>-- Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.



<P>Cissy's quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to

Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentlemen couldn't

see and to mind he didn't wet his new tan shoes.



<P>But who was Gerty?



<P>Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,

gazing far away into the distance, was in very truth as fair a specimen

of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced

beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more

a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining

even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had

done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch's female pills

and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired

feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike

purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid's bow, Greekly perfect.

Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as

white as lemon juice and queen of ointments could make them though it was

not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath

either. Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie,

when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had

of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals)

and she told her not let on whatever she did that it was her that told

her or she'd never speak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due.

There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly <I>hauteur</I> about

Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched

instep. Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree

in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education

Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land

and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician

suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.

Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured

face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange

yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charm few could resist. Why have

women such eyes of witchery? Gerty's were of the bluest Irish blue, set

off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows. Time gas when those brows

were not so silkilyseductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of

the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess novelette, who had first advised

her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes,

so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then

there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your

height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs

Dignam because she had a button one. But Gerty's crowning glory was her

wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.

She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled

about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her

nails too, Thursday for wealth. And just now at Edy's words as a telltale

flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked

so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God's fair land

of Ireland did not hold her equal.



<P>For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was

about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclination

prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips

pouted a while but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little

laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning. She knew

right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him

cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers' quarrel. As per

usual somebody's nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle

always riding up and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept

him in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate

that was on and he was going to Trinity college to study for a doctor when

he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in

the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he perhaps

for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing

to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her

in time. They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who

came first and after Him the blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph. But

he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked,

every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his

cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way

he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also

the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of

a size and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever

because he didn't go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.



<P>Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary

of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might

be out. A neat blouse of electric blue, selftinted by dolly dyes (because

it was expected in the <I>Lady's Pictorial</I> that electric blue would

be worn), with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket

(in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite

perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter

skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection.

She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast

trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly

bow to tone. All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille

but at last she found what she wanted at Clery's summer sales, the very

it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and

a penny. She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried

it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back

to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew

that that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were

the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was

very <I>petite</I> but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five,

and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart

buckle at her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect

proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of

her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with high spliced heels and

wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty's chief care and who that

knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would

never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had

four dinky sets, with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties

extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink,

pale blue, mauve and peagreen and she aired them herself and blued them

when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat

to keep the iron on because she wouldn't trust those washerwomen as far

as she'd see them scorching the things. She was wearing the blue for luck,

hoping against hope, her own colour and the lucky colour too for a bride

to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that

day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the

intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out

because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old

pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers' meetings if you

put those things on inside out so long as it wasn't of a Friday.



<P>And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is

there all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds

to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears,

she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings. Though not too

much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror. You are lovely,

Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely

sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain. Yes, she had known from

the first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells

ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T. C. D. (because the one who married the elder

brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude

Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive

blue fox was not to be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe

in love, a woman's birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoers'

(he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm

round her waist she went white to the very lips. He called her little one

in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it

was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a

remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had

never been Reggy Wylie's strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty

MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always waiting to be asked

and it was leap year too and would soon be over. No prince charming is

her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a

manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps

his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her

in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep

passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss. It would be like

heaven. For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart

of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor,

in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.



<P>And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she

was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his

little wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in

the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, the spitfire, because she would be

twenty-two in November. She would care for him with creature comforts too

for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling

of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a golden-brown hue and queen Ann's

pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because

she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising

flour and always stir in the same direction then cream the milk and sugar

and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn't like the eating part

when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why

you couldn't eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would

have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and

the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap's lovely dog Garryowen that almost

talked, it was so human, and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver

toastrack in Clery's summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.

He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men

for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed

sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon

(three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug

and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky,

simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went

out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and

gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.



<P>Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes, so then

she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off

and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy said

he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball

and if he took it there'd be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his

ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please.

The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since

he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to he off now with him and

she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.



<P>-- You're not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It's my ball. But Cissy

Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she

snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it

in full career, having won the day.



<P>-- Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.



<P>And she tickled tiny tot's two cheeks to make him forget and played

here's the lord mayor, here's his two horses, here's his gingerbread carriage

and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. But Edy

got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from

everyone always petting him.



<P>-- I'd like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won't

say.



<P>-- On the beetoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.



<P>Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy

saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she'd be ashamed of her life

to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the

gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Ciss.



<P>-- Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt

of her nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I'd look

at him.



<P>Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes.

For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and

jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men's faces on her

nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where

you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White.

That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget the evening she

dressed up in her father's suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and

walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette? There was none to come

up to her for fun. But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and

truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet

to be wholesome.



<P>And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing

anthem of the organ. It was the men's temperance retreat conducted by the

missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and benediction

of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered together without

distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see)

in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world,

kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our

Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar

words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. How sad to poor Gerty's ears!

Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking

the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson's Weekly,

she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none. Over and over

had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study

without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out

of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket,

thinking. But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and

homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed

in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen

her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely

for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was the man

who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness deserves to be

branded as the lowest of the low.



<P>And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,

Virgin most merciful. And Gerty, wrapt in thought, scarce saw or heard

her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off

Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself

passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him anyway

screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father

because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a

palpable case of doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on

it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor father! With

all his faults she loved him still when he sang <I>Tell me, Mary, how to

woo thee</I> or My <I>love and cottage near Rochelle</I> and they had stewed

cockles and lettuce with Lazenby's salad dressing for supper and when he

sang <I>The moon hath raised</I> with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and

was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her mother's birthday

that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and

Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.

No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he was laid to rest.

And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest

of his days and he couldn't even go to the funeral on account of the gout

and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his

office about Catesby's cork lino, artistic standard designs, fit for a

palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.



<P>A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the

house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in

gold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was

it rubbed on the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn't

like her mother taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing

they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the world of

her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main

every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where

she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer's

christmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in

the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering

a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice

window. You could see there was a story behind it. The colours were done

something lovely. She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude

and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.

She often looked at them dreamily when there for a certain purpose and

felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves

back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker's

pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon

days what they meant.



<P>The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion, till

at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting

behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down

towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to

voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there

by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball. Our two

champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble

Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please. The gentleman

aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy

Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty's skirt

near the little pool by the rock. The twins clamoured again for it and

Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew

back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn't come rolling down

to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.



<P>-- If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.



<P>Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her

pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted

her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball

a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down

towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw

attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the warm

flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming

into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most

casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him

and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely

drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.



<P>Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted

and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of

original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for

us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And careworn

hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred

and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with

hope for the reverend father Hughes had told them what the great saint

Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin's intercessory

power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful

protection were ever abandoned by her.



<P>The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood

are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy played with baby Boardman till

he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep she cried behind

the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy

popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn't the little chap enjoy

that! And then she told him to say papa.



<P>-- Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.



<P>And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for

eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health,

a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something

great, they said.



<P>-- Hajajajahaja.



<P>Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to

sit up properly, and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried

out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket

the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous

at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:



<P>-- Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.



<P>And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was

all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about

the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave

him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was

quickly appeased.



<P>Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out

of that and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little brats

of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the paintings

that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such

a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the

clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like

that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a

kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went pitapat. Yes, it was her

he was looking at and there was meaning in his look. His eyes burned into

her as though they would search her through and through, read her very

soul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust

them? People were so queer. She could see at once by his dark eyes and

his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo

she had of Martin Harvey, the matin&eacute;e idol, only for the moustache

which she preferred because she wasn't stagestruck like Winny Rippingham

that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but

she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly <I>retmuss&eacute;</I>

from where he was sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that,

and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have

given worlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so still

and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel

buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the

toes down. She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent

stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here

was that of which she had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and

there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively

that he was like no-one else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out

to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If

he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he

had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was

a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved

her. There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a womanly

woman not like other flighty girls, unfeminine, he had known, those cyclists

showing off what they hadn't got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive

all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory

of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man,

crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself

alone.



<P>Refuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. <I>Ora pro nobis</I>.

Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy

can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge

for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own

heart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass

windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the

blessed Virgin's sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O'Hanlon

at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down. He looked

almost a saint and his confession-box was so quiet and clean and dark and

his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun

in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena

of Saint Dominic. He told her that time when she told him about that in

confession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see,

not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were

all subject to nature s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no

sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said,

and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done

unto me according to Thy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often

she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered

floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she

noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canary bird that came

out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the

flowers for the forty hours' adoration because it was hard to know what

sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin

or some place.



<P>The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky

threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little monkeys

common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding

for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them. And Cissy

and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide

might come in on them and be drowned.



<P>-- Jacky! Tommy!



<P>Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very

last time she'd ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and

she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had

a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry

she was always rubbing into it she couldn't get it to grow long because

it wasn't natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. She ran

with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn't rip up her skirt at

the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy

about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she

had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner

she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running

and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would have served her just

right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with

her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine

tumble. <I>Tableau!</I> That would have been a very charming expos&eacute;

for a gentleman like that to witness.



<P>Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,

they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed

the thurible to Canon O'Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the

Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching

to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn't because she

thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all

her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his

eyes off of her and then Canon O'Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father

Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir

began to sing <I>Tantum ego</I> and she just swung her foot in and out

in time as the music rose and fell to the <I>Tantumer gosa cramen tum</I>.

Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow's of George's

street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn't a brack

on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her

insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!)

because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.



<P>Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with

her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel

tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight

before like a rag on her back and bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.

Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier,

a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl's shoulders,

a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You

would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the

like of that. She could almost see the swift answering flush of admiration

in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so

that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe

faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.

He was eyeing her as a snake eyes its prey. Her woman's instinct told her

that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet

swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious

rose.



<P>Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,

half smiling, with her specs, like an old maid, pretending to nurse the

baby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why

no-one could get on with her, poking her nose into what was no concern

of hers. And she said to Gerty:



<P>-- A penny for your thoughts.



<P>-- What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.

I was only wondering was it late.



<P>Because she wished to goodness they'd take the snottynosed twins and

their baby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave

a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her

the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing

time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told

to be in early.



<P>-- Wait, said Cissy, I'll ask my uncle Peter over there what's the time

by his conundrum.



<P>So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his

hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his

watchchain, looking at the church. Passionate nature though he was Gerty

could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he had

been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next

moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in

every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.



<P>Cissy said to excuse her would he mind telling her what was the right

time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and

looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch

was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set.

His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents

there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. Cissy said thanks

and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were

out of order.



<P>Then they sang the second verse of the <I>Tantum ergo</I> and Canon

O'Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and

he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire

to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she

could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and

she swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he

could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch

or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands

back into his pockets. She felt a Kind of a sensation rushing all over

her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her

stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when

she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves

on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her

shrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man's passionate

gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man's face. It is for you, Gertrude

MacDowell, and you know it.



<P>Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty

noticed that that little hint she gave had the desired effect because it

was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up

the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins' caps and tidied their hair to

make herself attractive of course and Canon O'Hanlon stood up with his

cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read

off and he read out <I>Panem de c<oe>lo pr<oe>stitisti eis</I> and Edy

and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty

could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing

politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing

her over. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes

that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt. O yes, it cut deep because

Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound

like the confounded little cat she was. Gerty's lips parted swiftly to

frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so

slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might

have dreamed of. She had loved him better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver

and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant

to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of

tears. Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort

she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them

to see.



<P>-- O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head

flashed up, I can throw my cap at who I like because it's leap year.



<P>Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the

ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young voice

that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As for Mr

Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside

as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a

second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces.

And it ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured

scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. Miss puny little Edy's

countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking

as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid

it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty

jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart in another

sphere, that she was not of them and there was somebody else too that knew

it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.



<P>Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked

in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because

the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior and Cissy told him

too that Billy Winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby

looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked

him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much

as by your leave, sent up his compliments on to his brandnew dribbling

bib.



<P>O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.



<P>The slight <I>contretemps</I> claimed her attention but in two twos

she set that little matter to rights.



<P>Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy

asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was

flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed

it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because

just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because

Canon O'Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put

round him round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed Sacrament

in his hands.



<P>How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse

of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time

a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither,

with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses

so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because

it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going

his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville

avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where

Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book <I>The

Lamplighter</I> by Miss Cummins, author of <I>Mabel Vaughan</I> and other

tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of. She loved to read

poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession

album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in

the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side

of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish

treasures trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the

whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons

to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful

thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely's of Dame

Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express

herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied

out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. Art <I>thou

real, my ideal?</I> it was called by Louis J. Walsh, Magherafelt, and after

there was something about <I>twilight, wilt thou ever?</I> and ofttimes

the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her

eyes with silent tears that the years were slipping by for her, one by

one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition

and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to

conceal it. But it must end she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his

eyes there would be no holding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths.

She would make the great sacrifice. Her every effort would be to share

his thoughts. Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild

his days with happiness. There was the allimportant question and she was

dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or

some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song

had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But even if

- what then? Would it make a very great difference? From everything in

the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled. She loathed

that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside

the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men, with no respect

for a girl's honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police

station. No, no: not that. They would be just good friends like a big brother

and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society

with a big ess. Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from

the days beyond recall. She thought she understood. She would try to understand

him because men were so different. The old love was waiting, waiting with

little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine!

She would follow her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told

her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love

was the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would

be wild, untrammelled, free.



<P>Canon O'Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and

the choir sang <I>Laudate Dominum omnes gentes</I> and then he locked the

tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed

him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn't she coming but Jacky

Caffrey called out:



<P>-- O, look, Cissy!



<P>And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over

the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.



<P>-- It's fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.



<P>And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,

helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy

holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn't fall running.



<P>-- Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It's the bazaar fireworks.



<P>But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and

call. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could

see from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses

tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke

in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave,

and it had made her his. At last they were left alone without the others

to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death,

steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips.

His hands and face were working and a tremor went over her. She leaned

back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in

her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no one to see

only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped

legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear

the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew about

the passion of men like that, hot-blooded, because Bertha Supple told her

once in dead secret and made her swear she'd never about the gentleman

lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board

that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers

and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine

sometimes in the bed. But this was altogether different from a thing like

that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel

him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome

lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn't do the other thing

before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand

without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy

kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham

so mad about actors' photographs and besides it was on account of that

other thing coming on the way it did.



<P>And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned

back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and

they all saw it and shouted to look, look there it was and she leaned back

ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying about through

the air, a soft thing to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman candle

going up over the trees up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless

with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more

and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her

face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back

and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that

caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four

and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that

he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was

trembling in every limb from being bent so far back he had a full view

high up above her knee no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and

she wasn't ashamed and he wasn't either to look in that immodest way like

that because he couldn't resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half

offered like those skirt-dancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen

looking and he kept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried to him

chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his

lips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girl's love, a little strangled

cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. And then

a rocket sprang and bang shot blind and O! then the Roman candle burst

and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O!O! in raptures and it

gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah!

they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lively! O so

soft, sweet, soft!



<P>Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She

glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of

piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl. He

was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he)

stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What

a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him

and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been.

He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes,

for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered.

Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That was their secret, only

theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell

save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro

and little bats don't tell.



<P>Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to

show what a great person she was: and then she cried:



<P>-- Gerty! Gerty! We're going. Come on. We can see from farther up.



<P>Gerty had an idea, one of love's little ruses. She slipped a hand into

her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course

without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he's too far to.

She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet again,

there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of

yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their souls bet in

a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a

strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She half

smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears,

and then they parted.



<P>Slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,

to Edy, to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was darker

now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed.

She balked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with

care and very slowly because Gerty MacDowell was...



<P>Tight boots? No. She's lame! O!



<P>Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That's why she's

left on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was wrong

by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse in a

woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn't know it when she was on show.

Hot little devil all The same. Wouldn't mind. Curiosity like a nun or a

negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is delicate. Near her

monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I have such a bad headache

today. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all right. All kinds of crazy longings.

Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell

rock oil. Virgins go mad in the end I suppose. Sister? How many women in

Dublin have it today? Martha, she. Something in the air. That's the moon.

But then why don't all women menstruate at the same time with same moon,

I mean? Depends on the time they were born, I suppose. Or all start scratch

then get out of step. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got

the best of that. Damned glad I didn't do it in the bath this morning over

her silly I will punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this morning.

That gouger M'Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife engagement in

the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for small mercies. Cheap

too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it themselves. Their natural

craving. Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices. Reserve better.

Don't want it they throw it at you. Catch em alive, O. Pity they can't

see themselves. A dream of wellfilled hose. Where was that? Ah, yes. Muioscope

pictures in Capel street: for men only. Peeping Tom. Willy's hat and what

the girls did with it. Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake?

<I>Lingerie</I> does it. Felt for the curves inside her <I>deshabill&eacute;</I>.

Excites them also when they're. I'm all clean come and dirty me. And they

like dressing one another for the sacrifice. Milly delighted with Molly's

new blouse. At first. Put them all on to take them all off. Molly. Why

I bought her the violet garters. Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks

and turnedup trousers. He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we

met. His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman

loses a charm with every pin she takes out. Pinned together. O Mairy lost

the pin of her. Dressed up to the nines for somebody. Fashion part of their

charm. Just changes when you're on the track of the secret. Except the

east: Mary, Martha: now as then. No reasonable offer refused. She wasn't

in a hurry either. Always off to a fellow when they are. They never forget

an appointment. Out on spec probably. They believe in chance because like

themselves. And the others inclined to give her an odd dig. Girl friends

at school, arms round each other's neck or with ten fingers locked, kissing

and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Nuns with whitewashed

faces, cool coif and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for

what they can't get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and write to me. And I'll

write to you. Now won't you? Molly and Josie Powell. Till Mr Right comes

along then meet once in a blue moon. <I>Tableau!</I> O, look who it is

for the love of God! How are you at all? What have you been doing with

yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking holes in each

other's appearance. You're looking splendid. Sister souls showing their

teeth at one another. How many have you left? Wouldn't lend each other

a pinch of salt.



<P>Ah!



<P>Devils they are when that's coming on them. Dark devilish appearance.

Molly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my foot.

O that way! O, that's exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest once

in a way. Wonder if it's bad to go with them then. Safe in one way. Turns

milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering plants I read

in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she's a flirt.

All are. Daresay she felt I. When you feel like that you often meet what

you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look at. Always know a fellow courting:

collars and cuffs. Well cocks and lions do the same and stags. Same time

might prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers? Suppose I when I was?

No. Gently does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss in the dark and never

tell. Saw something in me. Wonder what. Sooner have me as I am than some

poet chap with bearsgrease, plastery hair lovelock over his dexter optic.

To aid gentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my appearance my age.

Didn't let her see me in profile. Still, you never know. Pretty girls and

ugly men marrying. Beauty and the beast. Besides I can't be so if Molly.

Took off her hat to show her hair. Wide brim bought to hide her face, meeting

someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell.

Hair strong in rut. Ten bob I got for Molly's combings when we were on

the rocks in Holles street. Why not? Suppose he gave her money. Why not?

All a prejudice. She's worth ten, fifteen, more a pound. All that for nothing.

Bold hand. Mrs Marion. Did I forget to write address on that letter like

the postcard I sent to Flynn? And the day I went to Drimmie's without a

necktie. Wrangle with Molly it was put me off. No, I remember. Richie Goulding.

He's another. Weighs on his mind. Funny my watch stopped at half past four.

Dust. Shark liver oil they use to clean could do it myself. Save. Was that

just when he, she?



<P>O, he did. Into her. She did. Done.



<P>Ah!



<P>Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little

limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy Aftereffect not pleasant.

Still you have to get rid of it someway. They don't care. Complimented

perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the

kiddies. Well, aren't they. See her as she is spoil all. Must have the

stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too. <I>Amours</I>

of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain up.

Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive bosom. Little

sweetheart come and kiss me Still I feel. The strength it gives a man.

That's the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind coming out of

Dignam's. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn't have. Makes you want to

sing after. <I>Lacaus esant taratara</I>. Suppose I spoke to her. What

about? Bad plan however if you don't know how to end the conversation.

Ask them a question they ask you another. Good idea if you're in a cart.

Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she's on for

it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke

to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath street that night.

All the dirty things I made her say all wrong of course. My arks she called

it. It's so hard to find one who. Aho! If you don't answer when they solicit

must be horrible for them till they harden. And kissed my hand when I gave

her the extra two shillings. Parrots. Press the button and the bird will

squeak. Wish she hadn't called me sir. Oh, her mouth in the dark! And you

a married man with a single girl! That's what they enjoy. Taking a man

from another woman. Or even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get

away from other chap's wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the Burton

today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in my pocketbook.

Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don't think. Come

in. All is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How they change

the venue when it's not what they like. Ask you do you like mushrooms because

she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what someone was going to say

when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I went the whole hog, say:

I want to, something like that. Because I did. She too. Offend her. Then

make it up. Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake.

Flatters them. She must have been thinking of someone else all the time.

What harm? Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First

Kiss does the trick. The propitious moment. Something inside them goes

pop. Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best.

Remember that till their dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed

her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But

her breasts were developed. Fell asleep then. After Gencree dinner that

was when we drove home the featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep.

Lord mayor had his eye off her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.



<P>There she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up

like a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be,

waiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in mother's

clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. And the dark

one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she could whistle. Mouth

made for that. Like Molly. Why that high class whore In Jammet's wore her

veil only to her nose. Would you mind, please, telling me the right time?

I'll tell you the right time up a dark lane. Say prunes and prisms forty

times every morning, cure for fat lips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers

see most of the game. Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.

In their line.



<P>Didn't look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn't give that

satisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fine

eyes she had, clear. It's the white of the eye brings that out not so much

the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond a dog's

jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing

a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call that innocence?

Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her. Never see them sit on

a bench marked <I>Wet Paint</I>. Eyes all over them. Look under the bed

for what's not there. Longing to get the fright of their lives. Sharp as

needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street

was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false

arm. Had too. Where do they get that? Typist going up Roger Greene's stairs

two at a time to show her understandings. Handed down from father to mother

to daughter, I mean. Bred in the bone. Milly for example drying her handkerchief

on the mirror to save the ironing. Best place for an ad to catch a woman's

eye on a mirror. And when I sent her for Molly's Paisley shawl to Presscott's,

by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking. Clever

little minx! I never told her. Neat way she carried parcels too. Attract

men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the

blood flow back when it was red. Who did you learn that from? Nobody. Something

the nurse taught me. O, don't they know? Three years old she was in front

of Molly's dressingtable just before we left Lombard street west. Me have

a nice face. Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of the world. Young student. Straight

on her pins anyway not like the other. Still she was game. Lord, I am wet.

Devil you are. Swell of her calf. Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking

point. Not like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in

Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.



<P>A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads

and zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy ran out to see and Edy after

with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks. Will she?

Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion. Darling, I saw your.

I saw all.



<P>Lord!



<P>Did me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan's, Dignam's. For

this relief much thanks. In <I>Hamlet</I>, that is. Lord! It was all things

combined. Excitement. When she leaned back felt an ache at the butt of

my tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He's right. Might have made a worse

fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I will tell

you all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It couldn't be? No,

Gerty they called her. Might be false name however like my and the address

Dolphin's barn a blind.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Her maiden name was Jemina Brown

<BR>And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Place made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush.

Wiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if it

understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw anything

straight at school. Crooked as a ram's horn. Sad however because it lasts

only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa's pants

will soon fit Willy and fullers' earth for the baby when they hold him

out to do ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps them out of harm's way. Nature.

Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam. Children's hands always round them.

Cocoa-nut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their

swaddles and tainted curds. Oughtn't to have given that child an empty

teat to suck. Fill it up with wind. Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to

the hospital. Wonder is nurse Callan there still. She used to look over

some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace. That young doctor O'Hare

I noticed her brushing his coat. And, Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like

that too, marriageable. Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the

City Arms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.

Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in the

morning: was I drunk last night? Bad policy however to fault the husband.

Chickens come home to roost. They stick by one another like glue. Maybe

the women's fault also. That's where Molly can knock spots off them. It

is the blood of the south. Moorish. Also the form, the figure. Hands felt

for the opulent. Just compare for instance those others. Wife locked up

at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they

trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn't know what to call her.

Always see a fellow's weak point in his wife. Still there's destiny in

it, falling in love. Have their own secrets between them. Chaps that would

go to the dogs if some woman didn't take them in hand. Then little chits

of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little



<P>hobbies. As God made them He matched them. Sometimes children turn out

well enough. Twice nought makes one. Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing

bride. Marry in May and repent in December. This wet is very unpleasant.

Stuck. Well the foreskin is not back. Better detach.



<P>Ow!



<P>Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and

the short of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch. Wristwatches

are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic influence between

the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I suppose at once.

Cat's away the mice will play. I remember looking in Pill lane. Also that

now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism. Earth for instance pulling

this and being pulled. That causes movement. And time? Well that's the

time the movement takes. Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would

stop bit by bit. Because it's arranged. Magnetic needle tells you what's

going on in the sun, the stars. Little piece of steel iron. When you hold

out the fork. Come. Come. Tip. Woman and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly,

he. Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy

you if you're a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look,

look and if you have any guts in you. Tip. Have to let fly.



<P>Wonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third

person. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw

stuck out head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the

horse show. And when the painters were in Lombard street west. Fine voice

that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did, like flowers. It

was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the paint. Make

their own use of everything. Same time doing it scraped her slipper on

the floor so they wouldn't hear. But lots of them can't kick the beam,

I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a general all round over

me and half down my back.



<P>Wait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That's her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave

you this to think of me when I'm far away on the pillow. What is it? Heliotrope?

No, Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She'd like scent of that kind. Sweet

and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her with a little

jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the dance night she

met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She was wearing her black

and it had the perfume of the time before. Good conductor, is it? Or bad?

Light too. Suppose there's some connection. For instance if you go into

a cellar where it's dark. Mysterious thing too. Why did I smell it only

now? Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure. Suppose it's

ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across. Yes, it is. Because

those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off. Tell

you what it is. It's like a fine veil or web they have all over the skin,

fine like what do you call it gossamer and they're aways spinning it out

of them, fine as anything, rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to

everything she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers:

little kick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to

sniff in her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater

too. Reminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There

or the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes and

corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil or ether or something. Muskrat. Bag

under their tails one grain pour off odour for years. Dogs at each other

behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm. Hm. Very well, thank

you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that way. We're the same.

Some women for instance warn you off when they have their period. Come

near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. Like what? Potted herrings

gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the grass.



<P>Perhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves Long

John had on his desk the other. Breath? What you eat and drink gives that.

No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because priests that

are supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like flies round

treacle. Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The tree of forbidden

priest. O father, will you? Let me be the first to. That diffuses itself

all through the body, permeates. Source of life and it's extremely curious

the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.



<P>Mr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.

Almonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah, no, that's the soap.



<P>O by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never

went back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag

this morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could mention

Meagher's just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph. Two and

nine. Bad opinion of me he'll have. Call tomorrow. How much do I owe you?

Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving credit another

time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellow run up a bill on the

slate and then slinking around the back streets into somewhere else.



<P>Here's this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went

as far as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had

a good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper walk

a mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit. Walk

after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today. Still you

learn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as women don't

mock what matter? That's the way to find out. Ask yourself who is he now.

<I>The Mystery Man on the Beach</I>, prize titbit story by Mr Leopold Bloom.

Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that fellow today at

the graveside in the brown macintosh. Corns on his kismet however. Healthy

perhaps absorb all the. Whistle brings rain they say. Must be some somewhere.

Salt in the Ormond damp. The body feels the atmosphere. Old Betty's joints

are on the rack. Mother Shipton's prophecy that is about ships around they

fly in the twinkling. No. Signs of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant

hills seem coming nigh.



<P>Howth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change

or they might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace Darling. People afraid

of the dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Jewels diamonds

flash better. Light is a kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt you. Better

now of course than long ago. Country roads. Run you through the small guts

for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against. Scowl or smile.

Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray plants too in the shade after the

sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest. Roygbiv Vance taught us: red,

orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. A star I see. Venus? Can't

tell yet. Two, when three it's night. Were those nightclouds there all

the time? Looks like a phantom ship. No. Wait. Trees are they. An optical

illusion. Mirage. Land of the setting sun this. Homerule sun setting in

the southeast. My native land, goodnight.



<P>Dew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white

fluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his

way up through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold,

sore on the mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the position.

Like to be that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don't know how nice

you looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green apples. Grab at all

that offer. Suppose it's the only time we cross legs, seated. Also the

library today: those girl graduates. Happy chairs under them. But it's

the evening influence. They feel all that. Open like flowers, know their

hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues

under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat Dillon's garden where I kissed her shoulder.

Wish I had a full length oil-painting of her then. June that was too I

wooed. The year returns. History repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I'm

with you once again. Life, love, voyage round your own little world. And

now? Sad about her lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel

too much pity. They take advantage.



<P>All quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The rhododendrons.

I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums and I the plumstones. Where I come

in. All that old hill has seen. Names change: that's all. Lovers: yum yum.



<P>Tired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out

of me, little wretch. She kissed me. My youth. Never again. Only once it

comes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the same.

Like kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing new under

the sun. Care of P. O. Dolphin's barn. Are you not happy in your? Naughty

darling. At Dolphin's barn charades in Luke Doyle's house. Mat Dillon and

his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy, Hetty. Molly too.

Eightyseven that was.



<P>Year before we. And the old major partial to his drop of spirits. Curious

she an only child, I an only child. So it returns. Think you're escaping

and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home. And

just when he and she. Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we

played. Rip: tear in Henny Doyle's overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering.

Winkle: cockles and periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back.

She leaned on the sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep

in Sleepy Hollow. All changed. Forgotten. The young are old. His gun rusty

from the dew.



<P>Ba. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I'm a tree,

so blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you could

be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he goes. Funny

little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very likely. Hanging

by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him out, I suppose.

Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray for us. And pray

for us. And pray for us. Good idea the repetition. Same thing with ads.

Buy from us. And buy from us. Yes, there's the light in the priest's house.

Their frugal meal. Remember about the mistake in the valuation when I was

in Thom's. Twentyeight it is. Two houses they have. Gabriel Conroy's brother

is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder why they come out at night like mice. They're

a mixed breed. Birds are like hopping mice. What frightens them, light

or noise? Better sit still. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water

out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles. Like a little man in a

cloak he is with tiny hands. Weeny bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind

of a bluey white. Colours depend on the light you see. Stare the sun for

example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish.

Wants to stamp his trademark on everything. Instance, that cat this morning

on the staircase. Colour of brown turf. Say you never see them with three

colours. Not true. That half tabbywhite tortoise-shell in the <I>City Anns</I>

with the letter em on her forehead. Body fifty different colours. Howth

a while ago amethyst. Glass flashing. That's how that wise man what's his

name with the burning glass. Then the heather goes on fire. It can't be

tourists' matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind

and light. Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the

sun. Archimedes. I have it! My memory's not so bad.



<P>Ba. Who knows what they're always flying for. Insects? That bee last

week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might be

the one bit me, come back to see. Birds too never find out what they say.

Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve? they have to fly

over the ocean and back. Lot must be killed in storms, telegraph wires.

Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of ocean-going steamers floundering

along in the dark, lowing out like seacows. <I>Faugh a ballagh</I>. Out

of that, bloody curse to you. Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief

sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow.

Married too. Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere.

No ends really because it's round. Wife in every port they say. She has

a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again. If ever

he does. Smelling the tail end of ports. How can they like the sea? Yet

they do. The anchor's weighed. Off he sails with a scapular or a medal

on him for luck. Well? And the tephilim no what's this they call it poor

papa's father had on his door to touch. That brought us out of the land

of Egypt and into the house of bondage. Something in all those superstitions

because when you go out never know what dangers. Hanging on to a plank

or astride of a beam for grim life, life-belt round round him, gulping

salt water, and that's the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold

of him. Do fish ever get seasick?



<P>Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid,

crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones' locker. Moon looking down. Not

my fault, old cockalorum.



<P>A lost long candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of

funds for Mercer's hospital and broke, drooping, and sheda cluster of violet

but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The shepherd's hour:

the hour of holding: hour of tryst. From house to house, giving his everwelcome

double knock, went the nine o'clock postman, the glowworm's lamp at his

belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges. And among the five

young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy's terrace. By screens

of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing:

<I>Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup race!</I>

and from the door of Dignam's house a boy ran out and called. Twittering

the bat flew here, flew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept,

grey. Howth settled for slumber tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons

(he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of

ferns. He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing,

slumberous but awake. And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled,

winked at Mr Bloom.



<P>Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish

Lights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and breeches

buoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the Erin's

King, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the zoo. Filthy trip.

Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking overboard to feed the herrings.

Nausea. And the women, fear of God in their faces. Milly, no sign of funk.

Her blue scarf loose, laughing. Don't know what death is at that age. And

then their stomachs clean. But being lost they fear. When we hid behind

the tree at Crumlin. I didn't want to. Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood.

Frightening them with masks too. Throwing them up in the air to catch them.

I'll murder you. Is it only half fun? Or children playing battle. Whole

earnest. How can people aim guns at each other? Sometimes they go off.

Poor kids. Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her

for that. After getting better asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has.

What do they love? Another themselves? But the morning she chased her with

the umbrella. Perhaps so as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking. Little

hand it was: now big. Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when you touch.

Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I remember. Made me

laugh to see. Little paps to begin with. Left one is more sensitive, I

think. Mine too. Nearer the heart. Padding themselves out if fat is in

fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me. Frightened she

was when her nature came on her first. Poor child! Strange moment for the

mother too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar. Looking from Buena Vista.

O'Hara's tower. The seabirds screaming. Old Barbary ape that gobbled all

his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines. Looking out

over the sea she told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds. I always

thought I'd marry a lord or a gentleman with a private yacht. <I>Buenos

noches, se&ntilde;orita. El hombre ama la muchacha hermosa</I>. Why me?

Because you were so foreign from the others.



<P>Better not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you

dull. Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for <I>Leoh,

Lily of Killarney</I>. No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital to see.

Hope she's over. Long day I've had. Martha, the bath, funeral, house of

keys, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus' song. Then that bawler in Barney

Kiernan's. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters. What I said about his

God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No. Ought to go home and laugh

at themselves. Always want to be swilling in company. Afraid to be alone

like a child of two. Suppose he hit me. Look at it other way round. Not

so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he meant. Three cheers for Israel. Three

cheers for the sister-in-law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth.

Same style of beauty. Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea. The

sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has just come to town. Imagine

that in the early morning at close range. Everyone to his taste as Morris

said when he kissed the cow. But Dignam's put the boots on it. Houses of

mourning so depressing because you never know. Anyhow she wants the money.

Must call to those Scottish widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it

for granted we're going to pop off first. That widow on Monday was it outside

Cramer's that looked at me. Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably

on the premium. Her widow's mite. Well? What do you expect her to do? Must

wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to see. Looks so forlorn. Poor man

O'Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here. The sewage. Hopeless.

Some good matronly woman in a pork-pie hat to mother him. Take him in tow,

platter face and a large apron. Ladies' grey flannelette bloomers, three

shillings a pair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved, loved for ever,

they say. Ugly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow

we die. See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the

trick. U. p.: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also a shop often noticed.

Curse seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She

had red slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does. Would

I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer. Nannetti's gone. Mailboat.

Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad of Keyes's. Work Hynes and Crawford.

Petticoats for Molly. She has something to put in them. What's that? Might

be money.



<P>Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He

brought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can't read. Better go.

Better. I'm tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and

pebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with story

of a treasure in it thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children always

want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the waters. What's

this? Bit of stick.



<P>O! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here

tomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers do.

Will I?



<P>Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write

a message for her. Might remain. What?



<P>I.



<P>Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide

comes here a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark mirror,

breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and letters.

O, those transparent! Besides they don't know. What is the meaning of that

other world. I called you naughty boy because I do not like.



<P>AM. A.



<P>No room. Let it go.



<P>Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand.

Nothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here.

Except Guinness's barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by design.



<P>He flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck.

Now if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn't. Chance.

We'll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made

me feel so young.



<P>Short snooze now if I had. Must be near nine. Liverpool boat long gone.

Not even the smoke. And she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I won't

go. Race there, race back to Ennis. Let him. Just close my eyes a moment.

Won't sleep though. Half dream. It never comes the same. Bat again. No

harm in him. Just a few.



<P>O sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me

do love sticky we two naughty Grace darling she him half past the bed met

him pike hoses frillies for Raoul to perfume your wife black hair heave

under embon <I>se&ntilde;orita</I> young eyes Mulvey plump years dreams

return next in her next her next.



<P>A bat flew. Here. There. Here. Far in the grey a bell chimed. Mr Bloom

with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed. Just

for a few.

MR LEOPOLD BLOOM ATE WITH RELISH THE INNER ORGANS OF BEASTS and fowls.

He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liver

slices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencod's roes. Most of all he liked

grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly

scented urine.



<P>Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting

her breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the

kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him feel

a bit peckish.



<P>The coals were reddening.



<P>Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn't like

her plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the

hob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat, its

spout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked stiffly

round a leg of the table with tail on high.



<P>-- Mkgnao!



<P>-- O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.



<P>The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the

table, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writing-table. Prr. Scratch

my head. Prr.



<P>Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly, the lithe black form. Clean to see:

the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail,

the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.



<P>-- Milk for the pussens, he said.



<P>-- Mrkgnao! the cat cried.



<P>They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we understand

them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too. Wonder what I look

like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.



<P>-- Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the chookchooks.

I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.



<P>Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it.



<P>-- Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.



<P>She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively

and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits

narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to the

dresser, took the jug Hanlon's milkman had just filled for him, poured

warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.



<P>-- Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.



<P>He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped

three times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they

can't mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or kind

of feelers in the dark, perhaps.



<P>He listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with

this drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for

a mutton kidney at Buckley's. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. Better

a pork kidney at Dlugacz's. While the kettle is boiling. She lapped slower,

then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so rough? To lap better,

all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced round him. No.



<P>On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused

by the bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter

she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.



<P>He said softly in the bare hall:



<P>-- I am going round the corner. Be back in a minute.



<P>And when he had heard his voice say it he added:



<P>-- You don't want anything for breakfast?



<P>A sleepy soft grunt answered:



<P>-- Mn.



<P>No. She did not want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,

as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.

Must get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar. Forgotten

any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for it. Old style.

Ah yes, of course. Bought it at the governor's auction. Got a short knock.

Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At Plevna that was. I

rose from the ranks, sir, and I'm proud of it. Still he had brains enough

to make that corner in stamps. Now that was farseeing.



<P>His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat,

and his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback

pictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.

The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto's high

grade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White slip of

paper. Quite safe.



<P>On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there.

In the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky wardrobe.

No use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He pulled the

halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently

over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right till I come back

anyhow.



<P>He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number

seventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George's church. Be a warm

day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black conducts,

reflects (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn't go in that light suit.

Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy

warmth. Boland's breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers

yesterday's loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot. Makes you feel young. Somewhere

in the east: early morning: set off at dawn, travel round in front of the

sun, steal a day's march on him. Keep it up for ever never grow a day older

technically. Walk along a strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry

there, old ranker too, old Tweedy's big moustaches leaning on a long kind

of a spear. Wander through awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark

caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged

smoking a coiled pipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented

with fennel, sherbet. Wander along all day. Might meet a robber or two.

Well, meet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques along

the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal,

the evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches from her

doorway. She calls her children home in their dark language. High wall:

beyond strings twanged. Night sky moon, violet, colour of Molly's new garters.

Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of these instruments what do you call

them: dulcimers. I pass.



<P>Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track

of the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself. What

Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the <I>Freeman</I> leader:

a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank

of Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule sun

rising up in the northwest.



<P>He approached Larry O'Rourke's. From the cellar grating floated up the

flabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs

of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the end of the

city traffic. For instance M'Auley's down there: n. g. as position. Of

course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattle

market to the quays value would go up like a shot.



<P>Bald head over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for

an ad. Still he knows his own business best. There he Is, sure enough,

my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching

the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him

off to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I'm going to tell

you? What's that, Mr O'Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians, they'd only

be an eight o'clock breakfast for the Japanese.



<P>Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor

Dignam, Mr O'Rourke.



<P>Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway:



<P>-- Good day, Mr O'Rourke.



<P>-- Good day to you.



<P>-- Lovely weather, sir.



<P>-- 'Tis all that.



<P>Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the county

Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and behold,

they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then think of the competition.

General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub.

Save it they can't. Off the drunks perhaps. Put down three and carry five.

What is that? A bob here and there, dribs and drabs. On the wholesale orders

perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers. Square it with

the boss and we'll split the job, see?



<P>How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels

of stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Ten. Fifteen. He passed

Saint Joseph's, National school. Brats' clamour. Windows open. Fresh air

helps memory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee double

you. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At their joggerfry.

Mine. Slieve Bloom.



<P>He halted before Dlugacz's window, staring at the hanks of sausages,

polonies, black and white. Fifty multiplied by. The figures whitened in

his mind unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links packed

with forcemeat fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm

breath of cooked spicy pig's blood.



<P>A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He

stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too, calling

the items from a slip in her hand. Chapped: washing soda. And a pound and

a half of Denny's sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. Woods

his name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldfish. New blood. No followers

allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. She

does whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.



<P>The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with

blotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there like a stallfed heifer.



<P>He took up a page from the pile of cut sheets. The model farm at Kinnereth

on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter sanatorium. Moses

Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle

cropping. He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the blurred

cropping cattle, the page rustling. A young white heifer. Those mornings

in the cattlemarket the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop

and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the

litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one,

unpeeled switches in their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending

his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt

swinging whack by whack by whack.



<P>The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime

sausages and made a red grimace.



<P>-- Now, my miss, he said.



<P>She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.



<P>-- Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,

please?



<P>Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went

slowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the morning.

Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood outside the

shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He sighed down his

nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted toenails too. Brown

scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The sting of disregard glowed

to weak pleasure within his breast. For another a constable off duty cuddled

her in Eccles Lane. They like them sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr

Policeman, I'm lost in the wood.



<P>-- Threepence, please.



<P>His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.

Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers' pocket and laid them

on the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc

by disc, into the till.



<P>-- Thank you, sir. Another time.



<P>A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze

after an instant. No: better not: another time.



<P>-- Good morning, he said, moving away.



<P>-- Good morning, sir.



<P>No sign. Gone. What matter?



<P>He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:

planter's company. To purchase vast sandy tracts from Turkish government

and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel and construction.

Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa. You pay eight marks

and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or

citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation. Every year

you get a sending of the crop. Your name entered for life as owner in the

book of the union. Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments.

Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W. 15.



<P>Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.



<P>He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silvered powdered olivetrees.

Quiet long days: pruning ripening. Olives are packed in jars, eh? I have

a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows the taste of them

now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons too. Wonder is poor

Citron still alive in Saint Kevin's parade. And Mastiansky with the old

cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in Citron's basketchair. Nice

to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and

smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume. Always the same,

year after year. They fetched high prices too Moisel told me. Arbutus place:

Pleasants street: pleasant old times. Must be without a flaw, he said.

Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates

lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies

handling them in soiled dungarees. There's whatdoyoucallhim out of. How

do you? Doesn't see. Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore. His back

is like that Norwegian captain's. Wonder if I'll meet him today. Watering

cart. To provoke the rain. On earth as it is in heaven.



<P>A cloud began to cover the sun wholly slowly wholly. Grey. Far.



<P>No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead

sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind would lift those

waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it raining

down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead names. A

dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore the oldest, the

first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy's clutching a noggin bottle

by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity

to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere. It lay there now.

Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old woman's: the grey sunken cunt of

the world.



<P>Desolation.



<P>Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned

into Eccles Street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins,

chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I am here

now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong side of the bed. Must begin

again those Sandow's exercises. On the hands down. Blotchy brown brick

houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why is that? Valuation is only twenty-eight.

Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.

Plasters on a sore eye. To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan,

sizzling butter. Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.



<P>Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley Road, swiftly, in slim

sandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl

with gold hair on the wind.



<P>Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stopped and gathered

them. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quick heart slowed at once. Bold hand. Mrs

Marion.



<P>-- Poldy!



<P>Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm

yellow twilight towards her tousled head.



<P>-- Who are the letters for?



<P>He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.



<P>-- A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.

And a letter for you.



<P>He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of

her knees.



<P>-- Do you want the blind up?



<P>Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her

glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.



<P>-- That do? he asked, turning.



<P>She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.



<P>-- She got the things, she said.



<P>He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly

with a snug sigh.



<P>-- Hurry up with that tea, she said. I'm parched.



<P>-- The kettle is boiling, he said.



<P>But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled

linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.



<P>As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:



<P>-- Poldy!



<P>-- What?



<P>-- Scald the teapot.



<P>On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded

and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the

kettle then to let water flow in. Having set it to draw, he took off the

kettle and crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump

of butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily

against him. Give her too much meat she won't mouse. Say they won't eat

pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped

the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper. He sprinkled it through

his fingers, ringwise, from the chipped eggcup.



<P>Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks:

new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan's

seaside girls.



<P>The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby,

smiling. Silly Milly's birthday gift. Only five she was then. No wait:

four. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces of folded

brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.

<BLOCKQUOTE>O Milly Bloom, you are my darling.

<BR>You are my looking glass from night to morning.

<BR>I'd rather have you without a farthing

<BR>Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous

old chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And the

little mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into the parlour.

O, look what I found in professor Goodwin's hat! All we laughed. Sex breaking

out even then. Pert little piece she was.



<P>He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the

teapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it?

Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it upstairs,

his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.



<P>Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it

on the chair by the bedhead.



<P>-- What a time you were, she said.



<P>She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow

on the pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large

soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat's udder. The warmth

of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the

tea she poured.



<P>A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the

act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.



<P>-- Who was the letter from? he asked.



<P>Bold hand. Marion.



<P>-- O, Boylan, she said. He's bringing the programme.



<P>-- What are you singing?



<P>-- <I>La ci darem</I> with J. C. Doyle, she said, and <I>Love's Old

Sweet Song</I>.



<P>Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves

next day. Like foul flowerwater.



<P>-- Would you like the window open a little?



<P>She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:



<P>-- What time is the funeral?



<P>-- Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn't see the paper.



<P>Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled

drawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking:

rumpled, shiny sole.



<P>-- No: that book.



<P>Other stocking. Her petticoat.



<P>-- It must have fell down, she said.



<P>He felt here and there. <I>Voglio e non vorvez</I>. Wonder if she pronounces

that right: <I>voglio</I>. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped

and lifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of

the orange-keyed chamberpot.



<P>-- Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There's a word I wanted

to ask you.



<P>She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having

wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with

the hairpin till she reached the word.



<P>-- Met him what? he asked.



<P>-- Here, she said. What does that mean?



<P>He leaned downwards and read near her polished thumbnail.



<P>-- Metempsychosis?



<P>-- Yes. Who's he when he's at home?



<P>-- Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It's Greek: from the Greek. That

means the transmigration of souls.



<P>-- O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.



<P>He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eye. The same young eyes.

The first night after the charades. Dolphin's Barn. He turned over the

smudged pages. <I>Ruby: the Pride of the Ring</I>. Hello. Illustration.

Fierce Italian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor

naked. Sheet kindly lent. <I>The monster Maffei desisted and flung his

victim from him with an oath</I>. Cruelty behind it all. Doped animals.

Trapeze at Hengler's. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping. Break your

neck and we'll break our sides. Families of them. Bone them young so they

metempsychosis. That we live after death. Our souls. That a man's soul

after he dies. Dignam's soul...



<P>-- Did you finish it? he asked.



<P>-- Yes, she said. There's nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with

the first fellow all the time?



<P>-- Never read it. Do you want another?



<P>-- Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock's. Nice name he has.



<P>She poured more tea into her cup, watching its flow sideways.



<P>Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they'll write to

Kearney, my guarantor. Reincarnation: that's the word.



<P>-- Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body

after death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That we

all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.

They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their past lives.



<P>The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Better remind

her of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An example.



<P>The <I>Bath of the Nymph</I> over the bed. Given away with the Easter

number of <I>Photo Bits</I>: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea before

you put milk in. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three and

six I gave for the frame. She said it would look nice over the bed. Naked

nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.



<P>He turned the pages back.



<P>-- Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They

used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance.

What they called nymphs, for example.



<P>Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her,

inhaling through her arched nostrils.



<P>-- There's a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the

fire?



<P>-- The kidney! he cried suddenly.



<P>He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes

against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily

down the stairs with a flurried stork's legs. Pungent smoke shot up in

an angry Jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of the fork under

the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back. Only a little

burned. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown

gravy trickle over it.



<P>Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. He

shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a forkful

into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. Done

to a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one

in the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that about some young student

and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly

as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it

to his mouth.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Dearest Papli,



<P>Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me splendid.

Everyone says I'm quite the belle in my new tam. I got mummy's lovely box

of creams and am writing. They are lovely. I am getting on swimming in

the photo business now. Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs will send when

developed. We did great biz yesterday. Fair day and all the beef to the

heels were in. We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends

to make a scrap picnic. Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss

and thanks. I hear them at the piano downstairs. There is to be a concert

in the Greville Arms on Saturday. There is a young student comes here some

evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells he sings

Boylan's (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan's) song about those

seaside girls. Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects. Must now close

with fondest love.



<P>Your fond daughter, MILLY.



<P>P.S. Excuse bad writing, am in a hurry. Byby.

<BR>M.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Fifteen yesterday. Curious, fifteenth of the month too. Her first birthday

away from home. Separation. Remember the summer morning she was born, running

to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. Jolly old woman. Lots of babies

she must have helped into the world. She knew from the first poor little

Rudy wouldn't live. Well, God is good, sir. She knew at once. He would

be eleven now if he had lived.



<P>His vacant face stared pitying at the postscript. Excuse bad writing.

Hurry. Piano downstairs. Coming out of her shell. Row with her in the XL

Caf&eacute; about the bracelet. Wouldn't eat her cakes or speak or look.

Saucebox. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after

piece of kidney. Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she might do worse.

Music hall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash

down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.



<P>O well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing has happened.

Of course it might. Wait in any case till it does. A wild piece of goods.

Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny. Ripening now. Vain: very.



<P>He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.



<P>Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.

An&amp;Aelig;mic a little. Was given milk too long. On the Erin's <I>King</I>

that day round the Kish. Damned old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky.

Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.

<BLOCKQUOTE>All dimpled cheek's and curls,

<BR>Your head it simply swirls.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Seaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers pockets, jarvey

off for the day, singing. Friend of the family. Swurls, he says. Pier with

lamps, summer evening, band,

<BLOCKQUOTE>Those girls, those girls,

<BR>Those lovely seaside girls'</BLOCKQUOTE>

Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion. Reading

lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.



<P>A soft qualm regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will happen,

yes. Prevent. Useless: can't move. Girl's sweet light lips. Will happen

too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to move now. Lips

kissed, kissing kissed. Full gluey woman's lips.



<P>Better where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass

the time. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two and

six return. Six weeks off however. Might work a press pass. Or through

M'Coy.



<P>The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,

nosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing. Wants

to go out. Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her wait. Has

the fidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her ear with

her back to the fire too.



<P>He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood

up, undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.



<P>-- Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I'm ready.



<P>Heaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to

the landing.



<P>A paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just

as I'm.



<P>In the table drawer he found an old number of <I>Titbits</I>. He folded

it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in

soft bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.



<P>Listening, he heard her voice:



<P>-- Come, come, pussy. Come.



<P>He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards

the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry. The maid

was in the garden. Fine morning.



<P>He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.

Make a summerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to manure

the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur. All soil

like that without dung. Household slops. Loam, what is this that is? The

hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing. Best

of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes.

Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies' kid gloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes

too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in that corner there. Lettuce.

Always have fresh greens then. Still gardens have their drawbacks. That

bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.



<P>He walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on

the peg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny, I don't remember that. Hallstand

too full. Four umbrellas, her rain cloak. Picking up the letters. Drago's

shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown brilliantined

hair over his collar. Just had a wash and brushup. Wonder have I time for

a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox there got away James

Stephens they say. O'Brien.



<P>Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agenda what is it? Now, my miss.

Enthusiast.



<P>He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to

get these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head under

the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash

and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he peered through

a chink up at the nextdoor window. The king was in his counting house.

Nobody.



<P>Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper turning its pages over

on his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it a bit.

Our prize titbit. <I>Matcham's Masterstrike</I>. Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy,

Playgoers' club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has

been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds three. Three pounds

thirteen and six.



<P>Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding

but resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding,

he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still

patiently, that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it's

not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive one tabloid

of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or touch him but

it was something quick and neat. Print anything now. Silly season. He read

on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat certainly. <I>Matcham

often thinks of the master-stroke by which he won the laughing witch who

now</I>. Begins and ends morally. <I>Hand in hand</I>. Smart. He glanced

back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly,

he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of

three pounds thirteen and six.



<P>Might manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for

some proverb which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she

said dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving. Biting

her nether Hip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her. 9.15. Did

Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23. What possessed

me to buy this comb? 9.24. I'm swelled after that cabbage. A speck of dust

on the patent leather of her boot.



<P>Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stocking calf. Morning

after the bazaar dance when May's band played Ponchielli's dance of the

hours. Explain that morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night

hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head dancing. Her

fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money. Why? I noticed

he had a good smell off his breath dancing. No use humming then. Allude

to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The mirror was in shadow.

She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging

bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes. It wouldn't pan out somehow.



<P>Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then black with daggers

and eyemasks. Poetical idea pink, then golden, then grey, then black. Still

true to life also. Day, then the night.



<P>He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.

Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled

back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into

the air.



<P>In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully

his black trousers, the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What

time is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.



<P>A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George's church.

They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Heigho! Heigho!

<BR>Heigho! Heigho!

Quarter to. There again: the overtone following through the air, third.



<P>Poor Dignam!

Wandering Rocks</H1></CENTER>

THE SUPERIOR, THE VERY REVEREND JOHN CONMEE S. J, RESET HIS smooth watch

in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five to three.

Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy's name again? Dignam,

yes. <I>Vere dignum et justum est</I>. Brother Swan was the person to see.

Mr Cunningham's letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practical catholic:

useful at mission time.



<P>A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches,

growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of

charity and held out a peaked cap for aims towards the very reverend John

Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he

knew, one silver crown.



<P>Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long,

of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending

their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words: <I>If I

had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned

me in my old days</I>. He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves

and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M. P.



<P>-- Very well, indeed, father. And you father?



<P>Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton probably

for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was

that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. And Mr Sheehy

himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to be sure it was.

Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very probable

that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O, yes: a very

great success. A wonderful man really.



<P>Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M. P.

looking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M. P.

Yes, he would certainly call.



<P>-- Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.



<P>Father Conmee doffed his silk hat, as he took leave, at the jet beads

of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again in going. He

had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.



<P>Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard

Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice.



<P>-- Pilate! Wy don't you old back that owlin mob?



<P>A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in

his way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.

Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?



<P>O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.



<P>Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy

square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house: Aha. And were

they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his name?

Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man? His

name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.



<P>Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to master Brunny Lynam and

pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.



<P>-- But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said.



<P>The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed.



<P>-- O, sir.



<P>-- Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.



<P>Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's letter

to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox, Father

Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.



<P>Mr Denis J. Maginni, professor of dancing, &amp;c., in silk hat, slate

frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers,

canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most

respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner

of Dignam's court.



<P>Was that not Mrs M'Guinness?



<P>Mrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the

farther footpath along which she smiled. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted.

How did she do?



<P>A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to

think that she was a pawnbroker. Well, now! Such a... what should he say?...

such a queenly mien.



<P>Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup

free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Green B. A. will (D. V.) speak.

The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say a few

words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They acted according

to their lights.



<P>Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular

road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important

thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.



<P>A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All raised

untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian

brother boys.



<P>Father Conmee smelled incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint

Joseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee

raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they

were also badtempered.



<P>Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman.

And now it was an office or something.



<P>Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted

by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee

saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches

and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the tobacconist against which

newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America

those things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like

that, unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.



<P>Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window

of which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.



<P>Father Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where Corny

Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.

A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted

the constable. In Youkstetter's, the pork-butcher's, Father Conmee observed

pig's puddings, white and black and red, lying neatly curled in tubes.



<P>Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turf

barge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw

seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him.

It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator

who had made turf to be in bogs where men might dig it out and bring it

to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.



<P>On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis

Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound

tram.



<P>Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C.

of saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.



<P>At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram

for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.



<P>Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with

care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence

and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.

Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made

his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The solemnity

of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey

so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.



<P>It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father

Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee

supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with

the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping

her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.



<P>Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that

the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the

seat.



<P>Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the

mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.



<P>At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an

old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled

the bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and

a market net: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and

basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the

end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to

be told twice <I>bless you, my child</I>, that they have been absolved,

<I>pray for me</I>. But they had so many worries in life, so many cares,

poor creatures.



<P>From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grinned with thick niggerlips

at Father Conmee.



<P>Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men

and of his sermon of saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission and

of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown

and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their

last hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit,

<I>Le Nombre des &Eacute;lus</I>, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable

plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness

to whom the faith had not (D. V.) been brought. But they were God's souls

created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all

be lost, a waste, if one might say.



<P>At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor

and saluted in his turn.



<P>The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.

The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate

hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. Then came the

call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. Those were oldworldish

days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.



<P>Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book <I>Old Times in the

Barony</I> and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and

of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.



<P>A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel,

Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not

startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the jealous

lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery

fully, <I>eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris</I>, with her

husband's brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as

women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother.



<P>Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however

for men's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.



<P>Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and

honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling

noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters.

And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed

by don John Conmee.



<P>It was a charming day.



<P>The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying

to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of small white

clouds going slowly down the wind. <I>Moutonner</I>, the French said. A

homely and just word.



<P>Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds

over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes

field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of

the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was

their rector: his reign was mild.



<P>Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.

An ivory bookmark told him the page.



<P>Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.



<P>Father Conmee read in secret <I>Pater</I> and <I>Ave</I> and crossed

his breast. <I>Deus in adiutorium</I>.



<P>He wamked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till

he came to <I>Res</I> in <I>Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuotum

veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitu<oe> tu&amp;Aelig;</I>.



<P>A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a

young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised

his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached

from her light skirt a clinging twig.



<P>Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary.

<I>Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit

cor meum</I>.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping

eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect,

went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings.

Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway.

There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against

the doorcase, looking idly out.



<P>Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.



<P>Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted,

chewing his blade of hay.



<P>Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.



<P>-- That's a fine day, Mr Kelleher.



<P>-- Ay, Corny Kelleher said.



<P>-- It's very close, the constable said.



<P>Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth

while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a

coin.



<P>-- What's the best news? he asked.



<P>-- I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with

bated breath.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell's corner, skirting

Rabaiotti's icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards

Larry O'Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably



<P>-- <I>For England</I>...



<P>He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted

and growled:



<P>-- <I>home and beauty</I>.



<P>J.J. O'Molloy's white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in

the warehouse with a visitor.



<P>A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped

it into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks and glanced

sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward

four strides.



<P>He halted and growled angrily:



<P>-- <I>For England</I>...



<P>Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,

gaping at his stump with their yellow-slobbered mouths.



<P>He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head

towards a window and bayed deeply:



<P>-- <I>home and beauty</I>.



<P>The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.

The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card <I>Unfurnished Apartments</I>

slipped from the sash and fell.



<P>A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice

and taut shiftstraps. A woman's hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.

It fell on the path.



<P>One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel's

cap, saying:



<P>-- There, sir.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.



<P>-- Did you put in the books? Boody asked.



<P>Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds

twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.



<P>-- They wouldn't give anything on them, she said.



<P>Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles

tickled by stubble.



<P>-- Where did you try? Boody asked.



<P>-- M'Guinness's.



<P>Body stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.



<P>-- Bad cess to her big face! she cried.



<P>Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.



<P>-- What's in the pot? she asked.



<P>-- Shirts, Maggy said.



<P>Boody cried angrily:



<P>-- Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?



<P>Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:



<P>-- And what's in this?



<P>A heavy fume gushed in answer.



<P>-- Peasoup, Maggy said.



<P>-- Where did you get it? Katey asked.



<P>-- Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.



<P>The lacquey rang his bell.



<P>-- Barang!



<P>Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:



<P>-- Give us it here!



<P>Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey, sitting

opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random

crumbs.



<P>-- A good job we have that much. Where's Dilly?



<P>-- Gone to meet father, Maggy said.



<P>Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:



<P>-- Our father who art not in heaven.



<P>Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey's bowl, exclaimed:



<P>-- Boody! For shame!



<P>A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the

Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around

the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between

the Customhouse old dock and George's quay.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>The blonde girl in Thornton's bedded the wicker basket with rustling

fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper

and a small jar.



<P>-- Put these in first, will you? he said.



<P>-- Yes, sir, the blond girl said, and the fruit on top.



<P>-- That'll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.



<P>She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced

peaches.



<P>Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling

shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing

smells.



<P>H. E. L. Y.'S. filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane,

plodding towards their goal.



<P>He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from

his fob and held it at its chain's length.



<P>-- Can you send them by tram? Now?



<P>A darkbacked figure under Merchants' arch scanned books on the hawker's

car.



<P>-- Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?



<P>-- O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.



<P>The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.



<P>-- Will you write the address, sir?



<P>Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.



<P>-- Send it at once, will you? he said. It's for an invalid.



<P>-- Yes, sir. I will, sir.



<P>Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers' pocket.



<P>-- What's the damage? he asked.



<P>The blond girl's slim fingers reckoned the fruits.



<P>Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He

took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.



<P>-- This for me? he asked gallantly.



<P>The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his

tie a bit crooked, blushing.



<P>-- Yes, sir, she said.



<P>Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.



<P>Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the

red flower between his smiling teeth.



<P>-- May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>-- <I>Ma!</I> Almidano Artifoni said.



<P>He gazed over Stephen's shoulder at Goldsmith's knobby poll.



<P>Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping

frankly the handrests. Pale faces. Men's arms frankly round their stunted

forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank

of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.



<P>-- <I>Anch'io ho avuto di queste idee</I>, Almidano Artifoni said, <I>quand'

ero giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo &egrave; una

bestia. &Egrave; peccato. Perche la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita,

via. Invece, Lei si sacrifica</I>.



<P>-- <I>Sacrifizio incruento</I>, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant

in slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.



<P>-- <I>Speriamo</I>, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. <I>Ma,

dia retta a me. Ci rifletta</I>.



<P>By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram

unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.



<P>-- <I>Ci riflett&ograve;</I>, Stephen said, glancing down the solid

trouser-leg.



<P>-- <I>Ma, sul serio, eh?</I> Almidano Artifoni said.



<P>His heavy hand took Stephen's firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously

an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.



<P>-- <I>Eccolo</I>, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. <I>Venga

a trovarmi e ci pensi. Addio, caro</I>.



<P>-- <I>Arrivederla, maestro</I>, Stephen said, raising his hat when his

hand was freed. <I>E grazie</I>.



<P>-- <I>Di che?</I> Almidano Artifoni said. <I>Scusi, eh? Tante belle

cose!</I>



<P>Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted

on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted, signalling

in vain among the rout of bare-kneed gillies smuggling implements of music

through Trinity gates.

<P>Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of <I>The Woman in White</I>

far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.



<P>Too much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion?

Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.



<P>The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them:

six.



<P>Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:



<P>-- 16 June 1904.



<P>Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny's corner and the slab

where Wolfe Tone's statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L. Y.'S

and plodded back as they had come.



<P>Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette,

and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses.

Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She's not nicelooking, is she? The way she

is holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at the band

tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like

Susy Nagle's. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells

never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he won't keep me here till

seven.



<P>The telephone rang rudely by her ear.



<P>-- Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five.

Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I

can go after six if you're not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven

and six. I'll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.



<P>She scribbled three figures on an envelope.



<P>-- Mr Boylan l Hello! That gentleman from <I>Sport</I> was in looking

Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five.

<P>Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.



<P>-- Who's that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?



<P>-- Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied, groping for foothold.



<P>-- Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute

his pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.



<P>The vesta in the clergyman's uplifted hand consumed itself In a long

soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy

air closed round them.



<P>-- How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.



<P>-- Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic

council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself

a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. O'Madden

Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. The old bank

of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original

jews' temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide

road. You were never here before, Jack, were you?



<P>-- No, Ned.



<P>-- He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory

serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.



<P>-- That's right, Ned Lambert said. That's quite right, sir.



<P>-- If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to

allow me perhaps .



<P>-- Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like.

I'll get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from

here or from here.



<P>In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled

seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.



<P>From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.



<P>-- I'm deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won't trespass

on your valuable time...



<P>-- You're welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like.

Next week, say. Can you see?



<P>-- Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.



<P>-- Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.



<P>He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among

the pillars. With J.J. O'Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary's abbey

where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal,

O'Connor, Wexford.



<P>He stood to read the card in his hand.



<P>-- The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint Michael's,

Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He's writing a book about the Fitzgeralds

he told me. He's well up in history, faith.



<P>The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging

twig.



<P>-- I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.J. O'Molloy said.



<P>Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.



<P>-- God, he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare

after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? <I>I'm bloody

sorry I did it</I>, says he, <I>but I declare to God I thought the archbishop

was inside</I>. He mightn't like it, though. What? God, I'll tell him anyhow.

That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all

of them, the Geraldines.



<P>The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He

slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:



<P>-- Woa, sonny!



<P>He turned to J.J. O'Molloy and asked:



<P>-- Well, Jack. What is it? What's the trouble? Wait a while. Holdhard.



<P>With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant,

sneezed loudly.



<P>-- Chow! he said. Blast you!



<P>-- The dust from those sacks, J.J. O'Molloy said politely.



<P>-- No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before ... blast

your soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of draught...



<P>He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...



<P>-- I was... this morning... poor little... what do you call him... Chow!...

Mother of Moses!

<HR width="50%">



<P>Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his

claret waistcoat.



<P>-- See? he said. Say it's turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.



<P>He slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled

a while, ceased, ogling them: six.



<P>Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated

taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag

of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division

of King's bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth

smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.



<P>-- See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here. Turns Over.

The impact. Leverage, see?



<P>He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.



<P>-- Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late

can see what turn is on and what turns are over.



<P>-- See? Tom Rochford said.



<P>He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop:

four. Turn Now On.



<P>-- I'll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One

good turn deserves another.



<P>-- Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I'm Boylan with impatience.



<P>-- Goodnight, M'Coy said abruptly, when you two begin.



<P>Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.



<P>-- But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.



<P>-- Tooraloo, Lenehan said, see you later.



<P>He followed M'Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.



<P>-- He's a hero, he said simply.



<P>-- I know, M'Coy said. The drain, you mean.



<P>-- Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.



<P>They passed Dan Lowry's musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette,

smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.



<P>Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan

showed M'Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes like a bloody

gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it half choked with

sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky's vest and all, with the

rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil

and the two were hauled up.



<P>-- The act of a hero, he said.



<P>At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past

them for Jervis street.



<P>-- This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam's

to see Sceptre's starting price. What's the time by your gold watch and

chain?



<P>M'Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses' sombre office, then at O'Neill's

clock.



<P>-- After three, he said. Who's riding her?



<P>-- O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.



<P>While he waited in Temple bar M'Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle

pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy get

a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.



<P>The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the vice-regal

cavalcade.



<P>-- Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons

in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn't an earthly.

Through here.



<P>They went up the steps and under Merchants' arch. A dark-backed figure

scanned books on the hawker's cart.



<P>-- There he is, Lenehan said.



<P>-- Wonder what he is buying, M'Coy said, glancing behind.



<P>-- <I>Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye</I>, Lenehan said.



<P>-- He's dead nuts on sales, M'Coy said. I was with him one day and he

bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were

fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets

with long tails. Astronomy it was about.



<P>Lenehan laughed.



<P>-- I'll tell you a damn good one about comets' tails, he said. Come

over in the sun.



<P>They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the

river wall.



<P>Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's,

carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.



<P>-- There was a big spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said

eagerly. The annual dinner you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord mayor

was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke

and there was music. Bartell D'Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard.



<P>-- I know, M'Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.



<P>-- Did she? Lenehan said.



<P>A card <I>Unfurnished Apartments</I> reappeared on the windowsash of

number 7 Eccles street.



<P>He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.



<P>-- But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had

the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife

were there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and cura&ccedil;ao

to which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came

solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies.



<P>-- I know, M'Coy said. The year the missus was there...



<P>Lenehan linked his arm warmly.



<P>-- But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after

all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the

morning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's

night on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one

side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing

glees and duets: <I>Lo, the early beam of morning</I>. She was well primed

with a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. Every jolt the

bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell's delights! She has

a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.



<P>He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:



<P>-- I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.

Know what I mean?



<P>His hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in delight,

his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.



<P>-- The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She's a gamey

mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets

in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules

and the dragon and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was lost, so

to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last she spotted

a weeny weeshy one miles away. <I>And what star is that, Poldy?</I> says

she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. <I>That one, is it?</I> says Chris

Callinan, <I>sure that's only what you might call a pinprick</I>. By God,

he wasn't far wide of the mark.



<P>Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.



<P>-- I'm weak, he gasped.



<P>M'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan

walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly.

He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy.



<P>-- He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He's not

one of your common or garden... you know... There's a touch of the artist

about old Bloom.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of <I>The Awful Disclosures of Maria

Monk</I>, then of Aristotle's Masterpiece. Crooked botched print. Plates:

infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered

cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. All butting

with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minute somewhere.

Mrs Purefoy.



<P>He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: <I>Tales of the Ghetto</I>

by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.



<P>-- That I had, he said, pushing it by.



<P>The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.



<P>-- Them are two good ones, he said.



<P>Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.

He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned

waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.



<P>On O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay

apparel of Mr Denis J. Maginni, professor of dancing &amp;c.



<P>Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. <I>Fair Tyrants</I> by James

Lovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.



<P>He opened it. Thought so.



<P>A woman's voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: The man.



<P>No: she wouldn't like that much. Got her it once.



<P>He read the other title: <I>Sweets of Sin</I>. More in her line. Let

us see.



<P>He read where his finger opened.



<P>-- <I>All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores

on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For Raoul!</I>



<P>Yes. This. Here. Try.



<P>-- <I>Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his

hands felt for the opulent curves inside her d&eacute;shabill&eacute;</I>.



<P>Yes. Take this. The end.



<P>-- <I>You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eyeing her with a suspicious

glare. The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying

her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played

round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly</I>.



<P>Mr Bloom read again: <I>The beautiful woman</I>.



<P>Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amid

rumpled clothes. Whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched themselves

for prey. Melting breast ointments (<I>For him! For Raoul!</I>). Armpits'

oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (<I>her heaving embonpoint!</I>). Feel! Press!

Crushed! Sulphur dung of lions!



<P>Young! Young!



<P>An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of

chancery, king's bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the

lord chancellor's court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty

division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns

versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation

of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee

Corporation.



<P>Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy

curtains. The shopman's uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened

face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, spat phlegm on the floor. He

put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it and bent, showing

a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.



<P>Mr Bloom beheld it.



<P>Mastering his troubled breath, he said:



<P>-- I'll take this one.



<P>The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.



<P>-- <I>Sweets of Sin</I>, he said, tapping on it. That's a good one.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>The lacquey by the door of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell

twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.



<P>Dilly Dedalus, listening by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell,

the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains.

Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance

on five shillings? Going for five shillings.



<P>The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:



<P>-- Barang!



<P>Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.

J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched necks

wagging, negotiated the curve by the College Library.



<P>Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams's row.

He halted near his daughter.



<P>-- It's time for you, she said.



<P>-- Stand up straight for the love of the Lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.

Are you trying to imitate your uncle John the cornetplayer, head upon shoulders?

Melancholy God!



<P>Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and

held them back.



<P>-- Stand up straight, girl, he said. You'll get curvature of the spine.

Do you know what you look like?



<P>He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders

and dropping his underjaw.



<P>-- Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.



<P>Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.



<P>-- Did you get any money? Dilly asked.



<P>-- Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin

would lend me fourpence.



<P>-- You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.



<P>-- How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.



<P>Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along

James's street.



<P>-- I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?



<P>-- I was not then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns

taught you to be so saucy? Here.



<P>He handed her a shilling.



<P>-- See if you can do anything with that, he said.



<P>-- I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.



<P>-- Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You're like the rest

of them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother

died. But wait awhile. You'll all get a short shrift and a long day from

me. Low blackguardism! I'm going to get rid of you. Wouldn't care if I

was stretched out stiff. He's dead. The man upstairs is dead.



<P>He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.



<P>-- Well, what is it? he said, stopping.



<P>The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.



<P>-- Barang!



<P>-- Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.



<P>The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell

but feebly:



<P>-- Bang!



<P>Mr Dedalus stared at him.



<P>-- Watch him, he said. It's instructive. I wonder will he allow us to

talk.



<P>-- You got more than that, father, Dilly said.



<P>-- I'm going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I'll leave

you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, that's all I have. I got two shillings

from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.



<P>He drew forth a handful of copper coins nervously.



<P>-- Can't you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.



<P>Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.



<P>-- I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O'Connell

street. I'll try this one now.



<P>-- You're very funny, Dilly said, grinning.



<P>-- Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk

for yourself and a bun or a something. I'll be home shortly.



<P>He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.



<P>The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out

of Parkgate.



<P>-- I'm sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.



<P>The lacquey banged loudly.



<P>Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing

mincing mouth:



<P>-- The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn't do anything!

O, sure they wouldn't really! Is it little sister Monica!

<P>From the sundial towards James's Gate walked Mr Kernan pleased with

the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson boldly along James's street,

past Shackleton's offices. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr Crimmins?

First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment

in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive. Lovely weather we

are having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those farmers are always

grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. A

small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that General Slocum explosion.

Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And heartrending scenes. Men

trampling down women and children. Most brutal thing. What do they say

was the cause? Spontaneous combustion: most scandalous revelation. Not

a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst. What I can't

understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that... Now you

are talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You know why? Palmoil. Is that a fact?

Without a doubt. Well now, look at that. And America they say is the land

of the free. I thought we were bad here.



<P>I smiled at him. <I>America</I>, I said, quietly, just like that. <I>What

is it? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn't that true?</I>

That's a fact.



<P>Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there's money going there's

always someone to pick it up.



<P>Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy

appearance. Bowls them over.



<P>-- Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?



<P>-- Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered stopping.



<P>Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter

Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson street.

Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built under three

guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street club toff had

it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me

a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.



<P>Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.

Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom

again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has

it.



<P>North wall and sir John Rogerson's quay, with hulls and anchorchains,

sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the

ferry-wash, Elijah is coming.



<P>Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course.

Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy

body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Lambert's

brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He's as like it as damn it. No. The

windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash like that. Damn

like him.



<P>Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.

Good drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to

his fat strut.



<P>Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope.

Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife drove

by in her noddy.



<P>Let me see. Is he buried in saint Michan's? Or no, there was a midnight

burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall.

Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn down here.

Make a detour.



<P>Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the

corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. Outside the Dublin Distillers

Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins

knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering

the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse.



<P>Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry

Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for the office

of Messrs Collis and Ward.



<P>Mr Kernan approached Island street.



<P>Times of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences

of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now in a kind of

retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly's. No cardsharping then. One

of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger. Somewhere

here Lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. Stables behind Moira

house.



<P>Damn good gin that was.



<P>Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that

sham squire, with his violet gloves, gave him away. Course they were on

the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is: Ingram.

They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly. Masterly

rendition.



<P><I>At the siege of Ross did my father fall</I>.



<P>A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping,

leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.



<P>Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.



<P>His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a

pity!

<HR width="50%">



<P>Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary's fingers

prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dust

darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept on dull

coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and

winedark stones.



<P>Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil lights shining

in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows.

Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.



<P>She dances in a foul gloom where gum burns with garlic. A sailorman,

rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed silent

rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her

gross belly flapping a ruby egg.



<P>Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned

it and held it at the point of his Moses' beard. Grandfather ape gloating

on a stolen hoard.



<P>And you who wrest old images from the burial earth! The brainsick words

of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat standing

from everlasting to everlasting.



<P>Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown

along London bridge road, one with a sanded umbrella, one with a midwife's

bag in which eleven cockles rolled.



<P>The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse

urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always without you

and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I between them. Where?

Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter them, one and both.

But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you who can. Bawd and butcher,

were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A look around.



<P>Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You

say right, sir. A Monday morning, 'twas so, indeed.



<P>Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against

his shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing

Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped

prizering. The heavyweights in light loincloths proposed gently each to

other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes' hearts.



<P>He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.



<P>-- Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.



<P>Tattered pages. <I>The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Cur&eacute;

of Ars. Pocket Guide to Killarney</I>.



<P>I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. <I>Stephano Dedalo,

alumno optimo, palmam ferenti</I>.



<P>Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet

of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.



<P>Binding too good probably, what is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses.

Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read.

Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for

white wine vinegar. How to win a woman's love. For me this. Say the following

talisman three times with hands folded:



<P>-- <I>Se et yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen</I>.



<P>Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter

Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot's charms,

as mumbling Joachim's. Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your wool.



<P>-- What are you doing here, Stephen.



<P>Dilly's high shoulders and shabby dress.



<P>Shut the book quick. Don't let see.



<P>-- What are you doing? Stephen said.



<P>A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides.

It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her

of Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeck

bracelet, Dan Kelly's token. <I>Nebrakada femininum</I>.



<P>-- What have you there? Stephen asked.



<P>-- I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing

nervously. Is it any good?



<P>My eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring.

Shadow of my mind.



<P>He took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal's French primer.



<P>-- What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?



<P>She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.



<P>Show no surprise. Quite natural.



<P>-- Here, Stephen said. It's all right. Mind Maggy doesn't pawn it on

you. I suppose all my books are gone.



<P>-- Some, Dilly said. We had to.



<P>She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will

drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me,

my heart, my soul. Salt green death.



<P>We.



<P>Agenbite of inwit. Inwit's agenbite.

<P>-- Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.



<P>They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter's. Father Cowley

brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.



<P>-- What's the best news? Mr Dedalus said.



<P>-- Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I'm barricaded up, Simon,

with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.



<P>-- Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?



<P>-- O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.



<P>-- With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.



<P>-- The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I'm

just waiting for Ben Dollard. He's going to say a word to Long John to

get him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.



<P>He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging

in his neck.



<P>-- I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He's always

doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!



<P>He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.



<P>-- There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.



<P>Ben Dollard's loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed

the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards them at an

amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.



<P>As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:



<P>-- Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.



<P>-- Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.



<P>Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard's

figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:



<P>-- That's a pretty garment, isn't it, for a summer's day?



<P>-- Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously,

I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.



<P>He stood beside them beaming on them first and on his roomy clothes

from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:



<P>-- They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.



<P>-- Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be

to God he's not paid yet.



<P>-- And how is that <I>basso profondo</I>, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.



<P>Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glasseyed,

strode past the Kildare street club.



<P>Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter's mouth, gave forth

a deep note.



<P>-- Aw! he said.



<P>-- That's the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.



<P>-- What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What? He turned

to both.



<P>-- That'll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.



<P>The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old Chapterhouse of saint

Mary's abbey past James and Charles Kennedy's, rectifiers, attended by

Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the Ford of

Hurdles.



<P>Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,

his joyful fingers in the air.



<P>-- Come along with me to the subsheriff's office, he said. I want to

show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He's a cross between Lobengula

and Lynchehaun. He's well worth seeing, mind you. Come along. I saw John

Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall

if I don't... wait awhile... We're on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.



<P>-- For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.



<P>Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button

of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy

shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.



<P>-- What few days? he boomed. Hasn't your landlord distrained for rent?



<P>-- He has, Father Cowley said.



<P>-- Then our friend's writ is not worth the paper it's printed on, Ben

Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the particulars.

29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?



<P>-- That's right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He's a minister

in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?



<P>-- You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put

that writ where Jacko put the nuts.



<P>He led Father Cowley boldly forward linked to his bulk.



<P>-- Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his

glasses on his coatfront, following them.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>-- The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they

passed out of the Castleyard gate.



<P>The policeman touched his forehead.



<P>-- God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.



<P>He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on

towards Lord Edward street.



<P>Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head, appeared above

the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.



<P>Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father

Conmee and laid the whole case before him.



<P>-- You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.



<P>-- Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.



<P>John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly

down Cork hill.



<P>On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed

Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.



<P>The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.



<P>-- Look here Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the <I>Mail</I>

office. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.



<P>-- Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down

the five shillings too.



<P>-- Without a second word either, Mr Power said.



<P>-- Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.



<P>John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.



<P>-- I'll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted elegantly.



<P>They went down Parliament street.



<P>-- There's Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh's.



<P>-- Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.



<P>Outside <I>la Maison Claire</I> Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney's

brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.



<P>John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took

the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit who walked uncertainly

with hasty steps past Micky Anderson's watches.



<P>-- The assistant town clerk's corns are giving him some trouble, John

Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.



<P>They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh's winerooms. The

empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham,

speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.



<P>-- And Long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large

as life.



<P>The tall form of Long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.



<P>-- Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and

greeted.



<P>Long John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay

decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their

faces.



<P>-- Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?

he said, with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.



<P>Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,

about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to

know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the macebearer

laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum

even and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock

doing <I>locum tenens</I> for him. Damned Irish language, of our forefathers.



<P>Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.



<P>Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to

the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held

his peace.



<P>-- What Dignam was that? Long John Fanning asked.



<P>Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.



<P>-- O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness' sake

till I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!



<P>Testily he made room for himself beside Long John Fanning's flank and

passed in and up the stairs.



<P>-- Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don't think

you knew him or perhaps you did, though.



<P>With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.



<P>-- Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of

Long John Fanning ascending towards Long John Fanning in the mirror.



<P>-- Rather lowsized, Dignam of Menton's office that was, Martin Cunningham

said.



<P>Long John Fanning could not remember him.



<P>Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.



<P>-- What's that? Martin Cunningham said.



<P>All turned where they stood; John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the

cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness

and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past before

his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders, leaping

leaders, rode outriders.



<P>-- What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.



<P>-- The lord lieutenant general and general governor of Ireland, John

Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind

his panama to Haines.



<P>-- Parnell's brother. There in the corner.



<P>They chose a small table near the window opposite a long-faced man whose

beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.



<P>-- Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.



<P>-- Yes, Mulligan said. That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.



<P>John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw

went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.



<P>An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright,

at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.



<P>-- I'll take a <I>m&eacute;lange</I>, Haines said to the waitress.



<P>-- Two <I>m&eacute;langes</I>, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some

scones and butter and some cakes as well.



<P>When she had gone he said, laughing:



<P>-- We call it D. B. C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you

missed Dedalus on <I>Hamlet</I>.



<P>Haines opened his newbought book.



<P>-- I'm sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all

minds that have lost their balance.



<P>The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:



<P>-- <I>England expects</I>...



<P>Buck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.



<P>-- You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. Wandering

&amp;Aelig;ngus I call him.



<P>-- I am sure he has an <I>id&eacute;e fixe</I>, Haines said, pinching

his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what

it would be likely to be. Such persons always have.



<P>Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.



<P>-- They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will

never capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the

white death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a

poet. The joy of creation.



<P>-- Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled

him this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It's

rather interesting because Professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting

point out of that.



<P>Buck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to

unload her tray.



<P>-- He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said,

amid the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,

of retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does

he write anything for your movement?



<P>He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.

Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its

smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.



<P>-- Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write something

in ten years.



<P>-- Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.

Still, I shouldn't wonder if he did after all.



<P>He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.



<P>-- This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don't

want to be imposed on.



<P>Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of

ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street

past Benson's ferry, and by the three-masted schooner <I>Rosevean</I> from

Bridgwater with bricks.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell's yard. Behind

him Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell with stickumbrelladustcoat

dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith's house and, crossing, walked

along Merrion square. Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his

way by the wall of College Park.



<P>Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr

Lewis Werner's cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion

square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.



<P>At the corner of Wilde's he halted, frowned at Elijah's name announced

on the Metropolitan Hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke's lawn.

His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth bared he muttered:



<P>-- <I>Coactus volui</I>.



<P>He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.



<P>As he strode past Mr Bloom's dental windows the sway of his dustcoat

brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards,

having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly

face after the striding form.



<P>-- God's curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You're blinder

nor I am, you bitch's bastard!



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Opposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the

pound and half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he had been sent

for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming dull

sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell

and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the

superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney's. And they eating

crumbs of the cottage fruit cake jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.



<P>After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, court dress milliner,

stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts

and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam

gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin's pet lamb, will meet sergeant-major

Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns, God,

that'd be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh, that's the chap sparring

out to him with the green sash. Two bar entrance, soldiers half price.

I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned.

That's me in mourning. When is it? May the twenty-second. Sure, the blooming

thing is all over. He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam

turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin

lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the

two puckers. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes

that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.



<P>Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going

for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would

knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for science

was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging

and all.



<P>In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth and

a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling

him and grinning all the time.



<P>No Sandymount tram.



<P>Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to

his other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The blooming

stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it.

He met schoolboys with satchels. I'm not going tomorrow either, stay away

till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice I'm in mourning? Uncle

Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight. Then they'll all see it

in the paper and read my name printed and pa's name.



<P>His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was

a fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were

screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing

it downstairs.



<P>Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling

the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and

heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing

on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney's for

to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him

again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be

a good son to ma. I couldn't hear the other things he said but I saw his

tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam,

my father. I hope he is in purgatory now because he went to confession

to father Conroy on Saturday night.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>William Humble, earl of Dudley, and Lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel

Hesseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge. In the following

carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable

Gerald Ward, A. D. C. in attendance.



<P>The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix Park saluted by

obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern

quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis.

At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from

afar. Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges Lord Dudley's viceregal carriages

passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on

Arran Quay outside Mrs M. E. White's, the pawnbroker's, at the corner of

Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether

he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram

or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and

Broadstone terminus. In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the

costsbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond

bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J. Dodd, solicitor, agent

for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed

her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously on

the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall under

Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage.

Above the crossblind of the Ormond Hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy's

head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon

Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff's office,

stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously

returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From Cahill's corner the reverend Hugh C.

Love, M. A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose

hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan

and M'Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing

by Roger Greene's office and Dollard's big red printing house Gerty MacDowell,

carrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid up,

knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't

see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow

furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord

lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's winerooms

John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral

and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl

of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's all times ticking watches

and Henry and James's wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman

Henry, <I>dernier cri</I> James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and

Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing

the eyes of lady Dudley on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets

of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming <I>soubrette</I>,

great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt, smiled daubily

from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel

H. G. Hesseltine and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From

the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed

down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose

mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked

intently. In Fownes's street, Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward

from Chardenal's first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes

spinning in the glare John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial

Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch

not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of

King Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband

back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the

tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted

the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C., agreeably surprised,

made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white flagon H. halted

and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E. L. Y.'S., while

outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's music warerooms

Mr Denis J. Maginni professor of dancing &amp;c, gaily apparelled, gravely

walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost's wall came

jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks

to the refrain of <I>My girl's a Yorkshire girl</I>.



<P>Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high action

a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of

indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered

to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower

between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew

the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music which was

being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland laddies blared

and drumthumped after the <I>cort&eacute;ge</I>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>But though she's a factory lass

<BR>And wears no fancy clothes.

<BR>Baraabum.

<BR>Yet I've a sort of a

<BR>Yorkshire relish for

<BR>My little Yorkshire rose.

<BR>Baraabum.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H.

Thrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson,

C. Adderly, and W. C. Huggard started in pursuit. Striding past Finn's

hotel, Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through

a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr E. M. Solomons

in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster street,

by Trinity's postern, a loyal king's man, Horn-blower, touched his tallyho

cap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius

Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent with the topper and

raised also his new black cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper.

His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus

bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer's hospital, drove with his following

towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind stripling Opposite Broadbent's.

In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread,

passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy's path. At the Royal Canal

bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips agrin, bade

all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington road corner two

sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles

rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his

golden chain. On Northumberland and Landsdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged

punctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys

at the garden gate of the house said to have been admired by the late queen

when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in

1849, and the salute of Almidano Artifoni's sturdy trousers swallowed by

a closing door.

Lotus Eaters</H1></CENTER>

BY LORRIES ALONG SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY MR BLOOM WALKED soberly, past

Windmill lane, Leask's the linseed crusher's, the postal telegraph office.

Could have given that address too. And past the sailors' home. He turned

from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.

By Brady's cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked,

smoking a chewed fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead

eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop. Tell him if he smokes

he won't grow. O let him! His life isn't such a bed of roses! Waiting outside

pubs to bring da home. Come home to ma, da. Slack hour: won't be many there.

He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel. El, yes:

house of: Aleph, Beth. And past Nichols' the undertaker's. At eleven it

is. Time enough. Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged that job for O'Neill's.

Singing with his eyes shut. Corney. Met her once in the park. In the dark.

What a lark. Police tout. Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom

tooraloom tay. O, surely he bagged it. Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall.

With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.



<P>In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental

Tea Company and read the legends of lead-papered packets: choice blend,

finest quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom Kernan.

Couldn't ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still read blandly

he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand

with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning. Under their

dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside

his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down into the bowl of

his hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred

it to his waistcoat pocket.



<P>So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over again: choice

blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. The far east. Lovely spot it must

be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses,

flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them. Wonder is it like that. Those

Cinghalese lobbing around in the sun, in <I>dolce far niente</I>. Not doing

a hand's turn all day. Sleep six months out of twelve. Too hot to quarrel.

Influence of the climate. Lethargy. Flowers of idleness. The air feeds

most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic gardens. Sensitive plants. Waterlilies.

Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness in the air. Walk on roseleaves.

Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. Where was the chap I saw in that

picture somewhere? Ah, in the dead sea, floating on his back, reading a

book with a parasol open. Couldn't sink if you tried: so thick with salt.

Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water

is equal to the weight of the. Or is it the volume is equal of the weight?

It's a law something like that. Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints,

teaching. The college curriculum. Cracking curriculum. What is weight really

when you say the weight? Thirtytwo feet per second, per second. Law of

falling bodies: per second, per second. They all fall to the ground. The

earth. It's the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.



<P>He turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with

her sausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded <I>Freeman</I>

from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped

it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. Careless air: just drop

in to see. Per second, per second. Per second for every second it means.

From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice.

Too late box. Post here. No-one. In.



<P>He handed the card through the brass grill.



<P>-- Are there any letters for me? he asked.



<P>While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting

poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton

against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer probably.

Went too far last time.



<P>The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.

He thanked and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Henry Flower, Esq.

<BR>c/o P. O. Westland Row,

<BR>City.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Answered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing

again the soldiers on parade. Where's old Tweedy's regiment? Castoff soldier.

There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he's a grenadier. Pointed cuffs.

There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. Redcoats. Too showy. That must be

why the women go after them. Uniform. Easier to enlist and drill. Maud

Gonne's letter about taking them off O'Connell street at night: disgrace

to our Irish capital. Griffith's paper is on the same tack now: an army

rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire. Half baked

they look: hypnotised like. Eyes front. Mark time. Table: able. Bed: ed.

The King's own. Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby. A mason,

yes.



<P>He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as

if that would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger

felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.

Women will pay a lot of heed, I don't think. His fingers drew forth the

letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something pinned on: photo

perhaps. Hair? No.



<P>M'Coy. Get rid of him quickly. Take me out of my way. Hate company when

you.



<P>-- Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?



<P>-- Hello, M'Coy. Nowhere in particular.



<P>-- How's the body?



<P>-- Fine. How are you?



<P>-- Just keeping alive, M'Coy said.



<P>His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:



<P>-- Is there any... no trouble I hope? I see you're...



<P>-- O no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.



<P>-- To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?



<P>A photo it isn't. A badge maybe.



<P>-- E... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.



<P>-- I must try to get out there, M'Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard

it last night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?



<P>-- I know.



<P>Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door

of the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She stood

still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his

pockets for change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for

a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. Careless stand of her with her

hands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty creature at the polo match.

Women all for caste till you touch the spot. Handsome is and handsome does.

Reserved about to yield. The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable

man. Possess her once take the starch out of her.



<P>-- I was with Bob Doran, he's on one of his periodical bends, and what

do you call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conway's we were.



<P>Doran, Lyons in Conway's. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. In came

Hoppy. Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath

his veiled eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the

braided drums. Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight

perhaps. Talking of one thing or another. Lady's hand. Which side will

she get up?



<P>-- And he said: <I>Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?</I>

I said. <I>Poor little Paddy Dignam</I>, he said.



<P>Off to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces

dangling. Well turned foot. What is he fostering over that change for?

Sees me looking. Eye out for other fellow always. Good fallback. Two strings

to her bow.



<P>-- <I>Why?</I> I said. <I>What's wrong with him?</I> I said.



<P>Proud: rich: silk stockings.



<P>-- Yes, Mr Bloom said.



<P>He moved a little to the side of M'Coy's talking head. Getting up in

a minute.



<P>-- <I>What's wrong with him?</I> he said. He's dead, he said. And, faith,

he filled up. <I>Is it Paddy Dignam?</I> I said. I couldn't believe it

when I heard it. I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was

it in the Arch. <I>Yes</I>, he said. <I>He's gone. He died on Monday, poor

fellow</I>.



<P>Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!



<P>A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.



<P>Lost it. Curse your noisy pugnose. Feels locked out of it. Paradise

and the peri. Always happening like that. The very moment. Girl in Eustace

street hallway. Monday was it settling her garter. Her friend covering

the display of. <I>Esprit de corps</I>. Well, what are you gaping at?



<P>-- Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. Another gone.



<P>-- One of the best, M'Coy said.



<P>The tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich

gloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat

in the sun: flicker, flick.



<P>-- Wife well, I suppose? M'Coy's changed voice said.



<P>-- O yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.



<P>He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:

<BLOCKQUOTE>What is home without

<BR>Plumtree's Potted Meat?

<BR>Incomplete.

<BR>With it an abode of bliss.</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- My missus has just got an engagement. At least it's not settled yet.



<P>Valise tack again. By the way no harm. I'm off that, thanks.



<P>Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.



<P>-- My wife too, he said. She's going to sing at a swagger affair in

the Ulster hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.



<P>-- That so? M'Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who's getting it

up?



<P>Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread

and. No book. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens. Dark

lady and fair man. Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of envelope.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Love's

<BR>Old

<BR>Sweet

<BR>Song

<BR>Comes lo-ve's old...</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- It's a kind of a tour, don't you see? Mr Bloom said thoughtfully. <I>Sweet

song</I>. There's a committee formed. Part shares and part profits.



<P>M'Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.



<P>-- O well, he said. That's good news.



<P>He moved to go.



<P>-- Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.



<P>-- Yes, Mr Bloom said.



<P>-- Tell you what, M'Coy said. You might put down my name at the funeral,

will you? I'd like to go but I mightn't be able, you see. There's a drowning

case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have

to go down if the body is found. You just shove in my name if I'm not there,

will you?



<P>-- I'll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That'll be all right.



<P>-- Right, M'Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I'd go if I possibly

could. Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M'Coy will do.



<P>-- That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.



<P>Didn't catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I'd

like my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped corners,

riveted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him his for the

Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that

good day to this.



<P>Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has

just got an. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in

its way: for a little ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don't you know?

In the same boat. Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would. Can't he

hear the difference? Think he's that way inclined a bit. Against my grain

somehow. Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope that smallpox up

there doesn't get worse. Suppose she wouldn't let herself be vaccinated

again. Your wife and my wife.



<P>Wonder is he pimping after me?



<P>Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured

hoardings. Cantrell and Cochrane's Ginger Ale (Aromatic). Clery's summer

sale. No, he's going on straight. Hello. Leah tonight: Mrs Bandman Palmer.

Like to see her in that again. <I>Hamlet</I> she played last night. Male

impersonator. Perhaps he was a woman. Why Ophelia committed suicide? Poor

papa! How he used to talk about Kate Bateman in that! Outside the Adelphi

in London waited all the afternoon to get in. Year before I was born that

was: sixtyfive. And Ristori in Vienna. What is this the right name is?

By Mosenthal it is. Rachel, is it? No. The scene he was always talking

about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers

on his face.



<P>-- Nathan's voice! His son's voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left

his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of

his father and left the God of his father.



<P>Every word is so deep, Leopold.



<P>Poor papa! Poor man! I'm glad I didn't go into the room to look at his

face. That day! O dear! O dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was the best for

him.



<P>Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.

No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn't met that M'Coy

fellow.



<P>He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing

teeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet

oaten reek of horsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jugginses! Damn all they

know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags. Too

full for words. Still they get their feed all right and their doss. Gelded

too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches.

Might be happy all the same that way. Good poor brutes they look. Still

their neigh can be very irritating.



<P>He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper

he carried. Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.



<P>He passed the cabman's shelter. Curious the life of drifting cabbies,

all weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own. <I>Voglio

e non</I>. Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable. Shout a few flying

syllables as they pass. He hummed:

<BLOCKQUOTE>La ci darem la mano

<BR>La la lala la la.</BLOCKQUOTE>

He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the

lee of the station wall. No-one. Meade's timberyard. Piled balks. Ruins

and tenements. With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with

its forgotten pickeystone. Not a sinner. Near the timberyard a squatted

child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb. A wise tabby,

a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill. Pity to disturb them. Mohammed

cut a piece out of his mantel not to wake her. Open it. And once I played

marbles when I went to that old dame's school. She liked mignonette. Mrs

Ellis's. And Mr? He opened the letter within the newspaper.



<P>A flower. I think it's a. A yellow flower with flattened petals. Not

annoyed then? What does she say?

<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Henry,



<P>I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry

you did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am awfully

angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called you naughty

boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is the

real meaning of that word. Are you not happy in your home you poor little

naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you. Please tell me what

you think of poor me. I often think of the beautiful name you have. Dear

Henry, when will we meet? I think of you so often you have no idea. I have

never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you. I feel so bad about. Please

write me a long letter and tell me more. Remember if you do not I will

punish you. So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if

you do not write. O how I long to meet you. Henry dear, do not deny my

request before my patience are exhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye

now, naughty darling. I have such a bad headache today and write <I>by

return</I> to your longing



<P>MARTHA.



<P>P.S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to know.</BLOCKQUOTE>

He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and

placed it in his heart pocket. Language of flowers. They like it because

no-one can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then, walking

slowly forward, he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word.

Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don't

please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone

meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha's perfume. Having read it all he

took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.



<P>Weak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder did

she write it herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me,

respectable character. Could meet one Sunday after the rosary. Thank you:

not having any. Usual love scrimmage. Then running round corners. Bad as

a row with Molly. Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic. Go further next

time. Naughty boy: punish: afraid of-words, of course. Brutal, why not?

Try it anyhow. A bit at a time.



<P>Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.

Common pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere:

pinned together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses without

thorns.



<P>Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in

the Coombe, linked together in the rain.

<BLOCKQUOTE>O, Mary lost the pin of her drawers.

<BR>She didn't know what to do

<BR>To keep it up

<BR>To keep it up.</BLOCKQUOTE>

It? Them. Such a bad headache. Has her roses probably. Or sitting all day

typing. Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. What perfume does your wife use?

Now could you make out a thing like that?



<P><I>To keep it up</I>.



<P>Martha, Mary. I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or

faked for money. He is sitting in their house, talking. Mysterious. Also

the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.



<P><I>To keep it up</I>.



<P>Nice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there:

quiet dusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have been,

strange customs. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper:

fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of the well stonecold like the hole

in the wall at Ashtown. Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the

trottingmatches. She listens with big dark soft eyes. Tell her: more and

more: all. Then a sigh: silence. Long long long rest.



<P>Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly

in shreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered away,

sank in the dank air: a white flutter then all sank.



<P>Henry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the

same way. Simple bit of paper. Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque

for a million in the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be made out

of porter. Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt

four times a day, they say. Skin breeds lice or vermin. A million pounds,

wait a moment. Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon

of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter. One and four into

twenty: fifteen about. Yes, exactly. Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.



<P>What am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the same.



<P>An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.

Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The

bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together,

winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl

of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.



<P>He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. Stepping into the porch

he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind

the leather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work M'Coy for a pass

to Mullingar.



<P>Same notice on the door. Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.

J. on saint Peter Claver and the African mission. Save China's millions.

Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee. Prefer an ounce of opium.

Celestials. Rank heresy for them. Prayers for the conversion of Gladstone

they had too when he was almost unconscious. The protestants the same.

Convert Dr. William J. Walsh D. D. to the true religion. Buddha their god

lying on his side in the museum. Taking it easy with hand under his cheek.

Josssticks burning. Not like Ecce Homo. Crown of thorns and cross. Clever

idea Saint Patrick the shamrock. Chopsticks? Conmee: Martin Cunningham

knows him: distinguished looking. Sorry I didn't work him about getting

Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but

wasn't. They're taught that. He's not going out in bluey specs with the

sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he? The glasses would take

their fancy, flashing. Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub

lips, entranced, listening. Still life. Lap it up like milk, I suppose.



<P>The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps, pushed

the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.



<P>Something going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet place

to be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow music.

That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in the benches

with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch knelt at the

altar rails. The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing

in his hands. He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or

two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth. Her hat

and head sank. Then the next one: a small old woman. The priest bent down

to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next one.

Shut your eyes and open your mouth. What? <I>Corpus</I>. Body. Corpse.

Good idea the Latin. Stupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They

don't seem to chew it; only swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a

corpse why the cannibals cotton to it.



<P>He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by

one, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in

its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear.

We ought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here and

there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it

to melt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it's that sort

of bread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes them feel

happy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it's called. There's a big

idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel. First communicants.

Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one family party, same in the

theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I'm sure of that. Not so lonely.

In our confraternity. Then come out a big spreeish. Let off steam. Thing

is if you really believe in it. Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the

Knock apparition, statues bleeding. Old fellow asleep near that confession

box. Hence those snores. Blind faith. Safe in the arms of Kingdom come.

Lulls all pain. Wake this time next year.



<P>He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an

instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair

he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn't know what to do

to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back I. N. R. I.? No: I. H. S. Molly

told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it

is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.



<P>Meet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up with

a veil and black bag. Dusk and the light behind her. She might be here

with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the

sly. Their character. That fellow that turned queen's evidence on the invincibles

he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning.

This very church. Peter Carey. No, Peter Claver I am thinking of. Denis

Carey. And just imagine that. Wife and six children at home. And plotting

that murder all the time. Those crawthumpers, now that's a good name for

them, there's always something shiftylooking about them. They're not straight

men of business either. O no she's not here: the flower: no, no. By the

way did I tear up that envelope? Yes: under the bridge.



<P>The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs

smartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank

what they are used to Guinness's porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley's

Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane's ginger ale (aromatic). Doesn't

give them any of it: shew wine: only the other. Cold comfort. Pious fraud

but quite right: otherwise they'd have one old booser worse than another

coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer the whole atmosphere of the. Quite

right. Perfectly right that is.



<P>Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music. Pity.

Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument

talk, the <I>vibrato</I>: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner

street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the <I>Stabat Mater</I> of Rossini.

Father Bernard Vaughan's sermon first. Christ or Pilate? Christ, but don't

keep us all night over it. Music they wanted. Footdrill stopped. Could

hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice against that corner. I could

feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up:



<P><I>Quis est homo!</I>



<P>Some of that old sacred music is splendid. Mercadante: seven last words.

Mozart's twelfth mass: the <I>Gloria</I> in that. Those old popes were

keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina

for example too. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too chanting,

regular hours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green Chartreuse. Still,

having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick. What kind

of voice is it? Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.

Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn't feel anything after. Kind of a placid.

No worry. Fall into flesh don't they? Gluttons, tall, long legs. Who knows?

Eunuch. One way out of it.



<P>He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and

bless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom glanced

about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand up at the

gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat

back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the altar, holding

the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin.

Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card:



<P>-- O God, our refuge and our strength.



<P>Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throw them

the bone. I remember slightly. How long since your last mass? Gloria and

immaculate virgin. Joseph her spouse. Peter and Paul. More interesting

if you understood what it was all about. Wonderful organisation certainly,

goes like clockwork. Confession. Everyone wants to. Then I will tell you

all. Penance. Punish me, please. Great weapon In their hands. More than

doctor or solicitor. Woman dying to. And I schschschschschsch. And did

you chachachachacha? And why did you? Look down at her ring to find an

excuse. Whispering gallery walls have ears. Husband learn to his surprise.

God's little joke. Then out she comes. Repentance skindeep. Lovely shame.

Pray at an altar. Hail Mary and Holy Mary. Flowers, incense, candles melting.

Hide her blushes. Salvation army blatant imitation. Reformed prostitute

will address the meeting. How I found the Lord. Squareheaded chaps those

must be in Rome: they work the whole show. And don't they rake in the money

too? Bequests also: to the P. P. for the time being in his absolute discretion.

Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors. Monasteries

and convents. The priest in the Fermanagh will case in the witness box.

No browbeating him. He had his answer pat for everything. Liberty and exaltation

of our holy mother the church. The doctors of the church: they mapped out

the whole theology of it.



<P>The priest prayed:



<P>-- Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be

our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain

him, we humbly pray): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the

power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked

spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.



<P>The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The women

remained behind: thanksgiving.



<P>Better be shoving along. Brother Buzz. Come around with the plate perhaps.

Pay your Easter duty.



<P>He stood up. Hello. Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all

the time. Women enjoy it. Annoyed if you don't. Why-didn't you tell me

before. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there's a (whh!) just a (whh!)

fluff. Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked. Glimpses of the moon. Still

like you better untidy. Good job it wasn't farther south. He passed, discreetly

buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light.

He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him

and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy

water. Trams: a car of Prescott's dyeworks: a widow in her weeds. Notice

because I'm in mourning myself. He covered himself. How goes the time?

Quarter past. Time enough yet. Better get that lotion made up. Where is

this? Ah yes, the last time. Sweny's in Lincoln place. Chemists rarely

move. Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir. Hamilton Long's,

founded in the year of the flood. Huguenot churchyard near there. Visit

some day.



<P>He walked southward along Westland row. But the recipe is in the other

trousers. O, and I forgot that latchkey too. Bore this funeral affair.

O well, poor fellow, it's not his fault. When was it I got it made up last?

Wait. I changed a sovereign I remember. First of the month it must have

been or the second. O he can look it up in the prescriptions book.



<P>The chemist turned back page after page. Sandy shrivelled smell he seems

to have. Shrunken skull. And old. Quest for the philosopher's stone. The

alchemists. Drugs age you after mental excitement. Lethargy then. Why?

Reaction. A lifetime in a night. Gradually changes your character. Living

all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants. All his alabaster lilypots.

Mortar and pestle. Aq. Dist. Fol. Laur. Te Virid. Smell almost cure you

like the dentist's doorbell. Doctor whack. He ought to physic himself a

bit. Electuary or emulsion. The first fellow that picked an herb to cure

himself had a bit of pluck. Simples. Want to be careful. Enough stuff here

to chloroform you. Test: turns blue litmus paper red. Chloroform. Overdose

of laudanum. Sleeping draughts. Lovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad

for cough. Clogs the pores or the phlegm. Poisons the only cures. Remedy

where you least expect it. Clever of nature.



<P>-- About a fortnight ago, sir?



<P>-- Yes, Mr Bloom said.



<P>He waited by the counter, inhaling the keen reek of drugs, the dusty

dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling your aches

and pains.



<P>-- Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then

orangeflower water...



<P>It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.



<P>-- And white wax also, he said.



<P>Brings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to

her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my

cuffs. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth:

nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk. Skinfood.

One of the old queen's sons, duke of Albany was it? had only one skin.

Leopold yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to make it worse.

But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your? <I>Peau d'Espagne</I>.

That orangeflower. Pure curd soap. Water is so fresh. Nice smell these

soaps have. Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam. Turkish. Massage.

Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice girl did it. Also I

think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious longing I. Water to water. Combine

business with pleasure. Pity no time for massage. Feel fresh then all day.

Funeral be rather glum.



<P>-- Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought

a bottle?



<P>-- No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I'll call later in the day

and I'll take one of those soaps. How much are they?



<P>-- Fourpence, sir.



<P>Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.



<P>-- I'll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.



<P>-- Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you

come back.



<P>-- Good, Mr Bloom said.



<P>He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the

coolwrappered soap in his left hand.



<P>At his armpit Bantam Lyons' voice and hand said:



<P>-- Hello, Bloom, what's the best news? Is that today's? Show us a minute.



<P>Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look

younger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.



<P>Bantam Lyons' yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a

wash too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pears' soap?

Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.



<P>-- I want to see about that French horse that's running today, Bantam

Lyons said. Where the bugger is it?



<P>He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar. Barber's

itch. Tight collar he'll lose his hair. Better leave him the paper and

get shut of him.



<P>-- You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.



<P>-- Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. Half a mo. Maximum

the second.



<P>-- I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.



<P>Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.



<P>-- What's that? his sharp voice said.



<P>-- I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it

away that moment.



<P>Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread

sheets back on Mr Bloom's arms.



<P>-- I'Il risk it, he said. Here, thanks.



<P>He sped off towards Conway's corner. God speed scut.



<P>Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap

in it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed of it

lately. Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Raffle for large tender

turkey. Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Jack Fleming embezzling to

gamble then smuggled off to America. Keeps a hotel now. They never come

back. Fleshpots of Egypt.



<P>He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you of

a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. He

eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled

up like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it round like

a wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.

Something to catch the eye.



<P>There's Hornblower standing at the porter's lodge. Keep him on hands:

might take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, Mr Hornblower? How

do you do, sir?



<P>Heavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather.

Sit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They can't play it here.

Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Buller broke a window in the Kildare

street club with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more in their line.

And the skulls we were acracking when M'Carthy took the floor. Heatwave.

Won't last. Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of

life we trace is dearer than them all.



<P>Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid

stream. This is my body.



<P>He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of

warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk and

limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow:

his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating,

floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid

floating flower.

Cyclops</H1></CENTER>

I WAS JUST PASSING THE TIME OF DAY WITH OLD TROY O THE D.M.P. at the corner

of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he

near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have the weight

of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe

Hynes.



<P>-- Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody chimneysweep

near shove my eye out with his brush?



<P>-- Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?



<P>-- Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give

that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms

and ladders.



<P>-- What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.



<P>-- Devil a much, says I. There is a bloody big foxy thief beyond by

the garrison church at the corner of Chicken Lane - old Troy was just giving

me a wrinkle about him - lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to

pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop of

my thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.



<P>-- Circumcised! says Joe.



<P>-- Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm

hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny

out of him.



<P>-- That the lay you're on now? says Joe.



<P>-- Ay, says I . How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful

debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's

walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. <I>Tell

him</I>, says he, <I>I dare him</I>, says he, <I>and I doubledare him to

send you round here again or if he does</I>, says he, <I>I'll have him

summonsed up before the court, so will I, for trading without a licence</I>.

And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst! Jesus, I had to laugh

at the little jewy getting his shirt out. <I>He drink me my teas. He eat

me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?</I>



<P>For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's

parade, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold

and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty, Esquire, of 29 Arbour Hill in the

city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser,

videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings

per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal,

at three pence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the

said vendor of one pound five shillings and six pence sterling for value

received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in

weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no

pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or

pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall

be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the

said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said

amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor

in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said

vendor his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and

the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the

other part.



<P>-- Are you a strict t. t.? says Joe.



<P>-- Not taking anything between drinks, says I.



<P>-- What about paying our respects to our friend? says foe.



<P>-- Who? says I. Sure, he's in John of God's off his head, poor man.



<P>-- Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.



<P>-- Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.



<P>-- Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.



<P>-- Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful,

Joe?



<P>-- Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.



<P>-- What was that, Joe? says I.



<P>-- Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want

to give the citizen the hard word about it.



<P>So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse

talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure

like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over that bloody foxy

Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.



<P>In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There

rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in

life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it

is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gunnard,

the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the

dab, the brill, the flounder, the mixed coarse fish generally and other

denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild

breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions

their first class foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the

exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal

world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens

sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most

lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example

golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings,

creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage

from afar to woo them, from Elbana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes

of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster

and of Cruachan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district

of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.



<P>And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen

by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for

that purpose and thither come all herds and fatlings and first fruits of

that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended

from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the

fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks,

Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical

potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions,

pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat

vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter

ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries,

pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from

their canes.



<P>-- I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty,

you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!



<P>And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed

ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and

roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe's

prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different

varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bullocks

of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves:

and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating,

bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and

heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lush and Rush and Carrickmines and

from the streamy vales of Thomond, from M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible

and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of

the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance

of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins

and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs, in great hundreds,

various in size, the agate with the dun.



<P>So we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there sure enough was the citizen

up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy

mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way

of drink.



<P>There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his

load of papers, working for the cause.



<P>The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.

Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody

dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary

man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.



<P>-- Stand and deliver, says he.



<P>-- That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.



<P>-- Pass, friends, says he.



<P>Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:



<P>-- What's your opinion of the times?



<P>Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to

the occasion.



<P>-- I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down

his fork.



<P>So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:



<P>-- Foreign wars is the cause of it.



<P>And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:



<P>-- It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.



<P>-- Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I, I've a thirst

on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown.



<P>-- Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.



<P>-- Wine of the country, says he.



<P>-- What's yours? says Joe.



<P>-- Ditto MacAnaspey, says I...



<P>-- Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says

he.



<P>-- Never better, a <I>chara</I>, says he. What Garry? Are we going to

win? Eh?



<P>And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck

and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.



<P>The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was

that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired

freely freckled shaggybearded wide-mouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced

barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder

to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees

were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with

a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the

mountain gorse (<I>Ulex Europeus</I>). The widewinged nostrils, from which

bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that

within their cavernous obscurity the field-lark might easily have lodged

her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery

were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of

warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his

mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of

his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit

of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and

tremble.



<P>He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching

to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle

of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly

stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan

buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted

cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung

a row of seastones which dangled at every movement of his portentous frame

and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of

many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred

battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the Ardri Malachi, Art

MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield,

Red Hugh O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael

Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas

Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain

Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S. Fursa, S. Brendan, Marshal

Mac-Mahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees,

the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castille, the Man for Galway, The

Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who

Didn't, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L. Sullivan, Cleopatra,

Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William

Tell, Michelangelo, Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the

Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W. Shakespeare, Brian

Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan

and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier

Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler

Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine

Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack

the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor

of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro

Volta, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O'Sullivan Beare. A couched

spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage

animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was

sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic

movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquillising

blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.



<P>So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the

sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid. O, as true as

I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.



<P>-- And there's more where that came from, says he.



<P>-- Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.



<P>-- Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the

wheeze.



<P>-- I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and

Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.



<P>Who comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the

son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the prudent

soul.



<P>-- For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised

organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this

blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. <I>The Irish Independent</I>,

if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen

to the births and deaths in the <I>Irish all for Ireland Independent</I>

and I'll thank you and the marriages.



<P>And he starts reading them out:



<P>-- Gordon, Barnfield Crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's

on Sea, the wife of William T. Redmayne, of a son. How's that, eh? Wright

and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the

late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham Road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale

at Saint Jude's Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, Dean of Worcester,

eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington,

of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow.



<P>-- I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.



<P>-- Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of Davie Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller,

Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning Street, Liverpool,

Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son? How's

that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?



<P>-- Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they

had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.



<P>-- I will, says he, honourable person.



<P>-- Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.



<P>Ah! Owl! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.

Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.



<P>And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly

in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth, and behind him there

passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls

of law, and with him his lady wife, a dame of peerless lineage, fairest

of her race.



<P>Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug,

squeezed up with the laughing, and who was sitting up there in the corner

that I hadn't seen snoring drunk, blind to the world, only Bob Doran. I

didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And

begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bath

slippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife

hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman trotting like a poodle. I

thought Alf would split.



<P>-- Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with

a postcard someone sent him with u. p.: up on it to take a li...



<P>And he doubled up.



<P>-- Take a what? says I.



<P>-- Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.



<P>-- O hell! says I.



<P>The bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you

seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.



<P>-- <I>Bi i dho husht</I>, says he.



<P>-- Who? says Joe.



<P>-- Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round

to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to

the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p.: up. The

long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old

lunatic is gone round to Green Street to look for a G. man.



<P>-- When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.



<P>Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?



<P>-- Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us

a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen

long John's eye. U. p...



<P>And he started laughing.



<P>-- Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?



<P>-- Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.



<P>Terence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full

of the foaming ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun

brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda.

For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and

bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must

to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning

brothers, lords of the vat.



<P>Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,

that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted,

the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.



<P>But he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone

in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of

costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the

image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria

her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom

of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea,

queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule,

a victress over many peoples, the well-beloved, for they knew and loved

her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the

dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.



<P>-- What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up

and down outside?



<P>-- What's that? says Joe.



<P>-- Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging.

I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.



<P>So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.



<P>-- Are you codding? says I.



<P>-- Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.



<P>So Joe took up the letters.



<P>-- Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.



<P>So I saw there was going to be bit of a dust. Bob's a queer chap when

the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:



<P>-- How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?



<P>-- I don't know, says Alf. I saw him just now in Capel Street with Paddy

Dignam. Only I was running after that.



<P>-- You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?



<P>-- With Dignam, says Alf.



<P>-- Is it Paddy? says Joe.



<P>-- Yes, says Alf. Why?



<P>-- Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.



<P>-- Paddy Dignam dead? says Alf.



<P>-- Ay, says Joe.



<P>-- Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain

as a pikestaff.



<P>-- Who's dead? says Bob Doran.



<P>-- You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.



<P>-- What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... and Willie Murray

with him, the two of them there near what-doyoucallhim's... What? Dignam

dead?



<P>-- What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about... ?



<P>-- Dead! says Alf. He is no more dead than you are.



<P>-- Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning

anyhow.



<P>-- Paddy? says Alf.



<P>-- Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.



<P>-- Good Christ! says Alf.



<P>Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.



<P>In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by

tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing

luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the

etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic

rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through

the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays

emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname

as to his whereabouts in the heaven-world he stated that he was now on

the path of pralaya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands

of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to

a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated

that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had

passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to

them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in

the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in

the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort

such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest

adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having

requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded

relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who

were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it

was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief

on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether

there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply

was: <I>We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind

C.K. doesn't pile it on</I>. It was ascertained that the reference was

to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.J. O'Neill's popular funeral

establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible

for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he

requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot

which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return

room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the

heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace

of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should

be made known.



<P>Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was

intimated that this had given satisfaction.



<P>He is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was

his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your

wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.



<P>-- There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.



<P>-- Who? says I.



<P>-- Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last

ten minutes.



<P>And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.



<P>Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.



<P>-- Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.



<P>And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard

in Dublin when he's under the influence:



<P>-- Who said Christ is good?



<P>-- I beg your parsnips, says Alf.



<P>-- Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy

Dignam?



<P>-- Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.



<P>But Bob Doran shouts out of him.



<P>-- He's a bloody ruffian I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.



<P>Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't

want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran

starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.



<P>-- The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.



<P>The tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter

for him to go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney,

the bumbailiff's daughter. Mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street that used

to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping

there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person,

open to all comers, fair field and no favour.



<P>-- The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy,

poor little Paddy Dignam.



<P>And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that

beam of heaven.



<P>Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round

the door.



<P>-- Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.



<P>So Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was

Martin Cunningham there.



<P>-- O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to

this, will you?



<P>And he starts reading out one.

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>7, Hunter Street, Liverpool.</I>

<BR><I>To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.</I>

<BR><I>Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the above-mentioned painful

<P>-- Show us, Joe, says I.



<P>-- ... <I>private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville

<P>-- Jesus, says I.



<P>-- ... <I>Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith</I>...



<P>The citizen made a grab at the letter.



<P>-- Hold hard, says Joe, <I>i have a special nack of putting the noose

once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir'

my teas is five ginnese</I>.



<P>H. Rumbold,



<P>Master Barber.</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.



<P>-- And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take

them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you

have?



<P>So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and

couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well

he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.



<P>-- Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.



<P>And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with

a black border round it.



<P>-- They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang

their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.



<P>And he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his

heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop

up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.



<P>In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their

deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever

wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so

saith the Lord.



<P>So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom

comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business

and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those Jewies does have

a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what

all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.



<P>-- There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.



<P>-- What's that? says Joe.



<P>-- The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.



<P>-- That so? says Joe.



<P>-- God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was

in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when

they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like

a poker.



<P>-- Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.



<P>-- That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural

phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...



<P>And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science

and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.



<P>The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered

medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical

vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to

the best approved traditions of medical science, be calculated to inevitably

produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve

centres, causing the pores of the cobra <I>cavernosa</I> to rapidly dilate

in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that

part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in

the phenomenon which has been dominated by the faculty a morbid upwards

and outwards philoprogenitive erection <I>in articulo mortis per diminutionem

capitis</I>.



<P>So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and

he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and

the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with

him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the

cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and

the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so

he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffling and sneezing all round the place

and scratching his scabs and round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing

Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran

starts doing the bloody fool with him:



<P>-- Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy. Give us the

paw here! Give us the paw!



<P>Arrah! bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from

tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking

all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and

intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few

bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacob's tin he told Terry to

bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out

of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.



<P>And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers

Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for

your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from

the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank

with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old

phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping

up in the <I>City Arms</I> Pisser Burke told me there was an old one there

with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft

side of her doing the mollycoddle playing b&eacute;zique to come in for

a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because

the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a

walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer,

he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl

and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings

if the three women didn't near roast him it's a queer story, the old one,

Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh

at Pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat and Bloom with his <I>but

don't you see?</I> and <I>but on the other hand</I>. And sure, more be

token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in

Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking

his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!



<P>-- The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass

and glaring at Bloom.



<P>-- Ay, ay, says Joe.



<P>-- You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...



<P>-- <I>Sinn Fein!</I> says the citizen. <I>Sinn fein amhain!</I> The

friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.



<P>The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far

and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the

gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums

punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps

of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly

scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural

pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from

the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled

multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand

persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief

Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the

York Street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably

rendering on their black draped instruments the matchless melody endeared

to us from the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion

trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of

our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable

amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and

M-ll-g-n who sang <I>The Night before Larry was stretched</I> in their

usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring

trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody

who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will

grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female

Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were

delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and

a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent

idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely

instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown

ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions

on the grand stand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the

Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.

The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci

Beninobenone (the semi-paralysed <I>doyen</I> of the party who had to be

assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul

Petit&eacute;patant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the

Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha

Virdga Kis&aacute;szony Putr&aacute;pesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos

Karamelopulos. Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Se&ntilde;or Hidalgo

Herr Hurhausdirektorprasident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanato

riumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentgeneralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor

Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed

themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the

nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated

altercation (in which all took part) ensued among F.O.T.E.I. as to whether

the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's

patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs,

blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters,

sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged.

The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from

Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed

the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both

contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed

to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated

by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore

Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair,

It was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various

articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during

the affray from the pockets of his Junior colleagues in the hope of bringing

them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies'

and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their

rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.



<P>Quietly, unassumingly, Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless

morning dress and wearing his favourite flower the <I>Gladiolus Cruentus</I>.

He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many

have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate - short, painstaking yet withal

so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the world-renowned headsman

was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal

ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more

excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries,

<I>hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah</I>,

amid which the ringing <I>evviva</I> of the delegate of the land of song

(a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the

eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.

It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly

given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's

patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since

the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance,

Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy

religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in

a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary

head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.

Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage

being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures

through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal

he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny

forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been

provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome

mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the

various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by

the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield),

a terracotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine

and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs

destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim.

The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance

to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.

Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and

onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating

tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption

of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared

for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning

to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to

the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that

the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick

and indigent roomkeeper's association as a token of his regard and esteem.

The <I>nec</I> and <I>non plus ultra</I> of emotion were reached when the

blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders

and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched

into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving

embrace murmuring fondly <I>Sheila, my own</I>. Encouraged by this use

of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable

areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour

to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears

that she would cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero

boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going

to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection

the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey

when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious

of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators,

including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That

monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome

with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of

tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people,

touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least

affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of

the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making

frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not

a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred

when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the

fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and

genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting

her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience

was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of

a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a

fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer,

by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history)

placed on the finger of his blushing <I>fianc&eacute;e</I> an expensive

engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock

excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel

Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion,

he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without

flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed

gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard by those privileged

burghers who happened to be in his immediate <I>entourage</I> to murmur

to himself in a faltering undertone:



<P>-- God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey

it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause

I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.



<P>So then the citizens begin talking about the Irish language and the

corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak their

own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and

Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off

Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and

drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob,

he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would

call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went

in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about

she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay, and there

was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in

Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages

and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob,

flahoolagh entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free.

And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers

shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky

pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females,

hitting below the belt.



<P>So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty

starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I would,

if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't

blind him.



<P>-- Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, sneering.



<P>-- No, says 1. But he might take my leg for a lampost.



<P>So he calls the old dog over.



<P>-- What's on you, Garry? says he.



<P>Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the

old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such

growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has

nothing better to do ought to write a letter pm <I>bono publico</I> to

the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling

and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the

hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.



<P>All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the

lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing

the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old

Irish red wolfdog setter formerly known by the <I>sobriquet</I> of Garryowen

and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances

Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by

kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other

achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert

(wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in

his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it

bears a <I>striking</I> resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns

of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful

lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful

pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world

but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication

published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal

note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and

of Donald MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present

very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered

into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not

at liberty to disclose though we believe our readers will find the topical

allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine

original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules

of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our

readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should

be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken

somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.

<BLOCKQUOTE>The curse of my curses

<BR>Seven days every day

<BR>And seven dry Thursdays

<BR>On you, Barney Kiernan,

<BR>Has no sup of water

<BR>To cool my courage,

<BR>And my guts red roaring

<BR>After Lowry's lights.</BLOCKQUOTE>

So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear

him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.



<P>-- I will, says he, <I>a chara</I>, to show there's no ill feeling.



<P>Gob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one

pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and

getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man

and beast. And says Joe:



<P>-- Could you make a hole in another pint?



<P>-- Could a swim duck? says I.



<P>-- Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything

in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.



<P>-- Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet

Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's.

Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't

serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally

under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.



<P>-- Holy Wars, says Joe laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is

landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?



<P>-- Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.



<P>-- Whose admirers? says Joe.



<P>-- The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.



<P>Then he starts all confused mucking it up about the mortgagor under

the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the

benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that

Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested

the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor

under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act

that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling

bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery.

True as you re there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged

Hungarian robbery.



<P>So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he

was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to

tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never

a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. Choking

with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell

her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.



<P>-- Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however

slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded,

as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem, as to request of

you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let

the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.



<P>-- No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which

actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me

consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this

proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the

cup.



<P>-- Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart,

I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions

which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to

give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.



<P>And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o'clock.

Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14 A.

Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time,

fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of

teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and

talking against the catholic religion and he serving mass in Adam and Eve's

when he was young with his eyes shut who wrote the new testament and the

old testament and hugging and snugging. And the two shawls killed with

the laughing, picking his pockets the bloody fool and he spilling the porter

all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.

<I>How is your testament? Have you got an old testament?</I> Only Paddy

was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little

concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel,

with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing

the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old prostitute of a mother

procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told

him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.



<P>So Terry brought the three pints.



<P>-- Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.



<P>-- <I>Slan leat</I>, says he.



<P>-- Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.



<P>Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small

fortune to keep him in drinks.



<P>-- Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.



<P>-- Friend of yours, says Alf.



<P>-- Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?



<P>-- I won't mention any names, says Alf.



<P>-- I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William

Field, M. P., the cattle traders. -- Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that

exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.



<P>So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and

the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending

them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the

scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for

timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker's yard. Walking

about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are coming till

Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. Mister

Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling

me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears sometimes with Mrs

O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't

loosen her farting strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing

her how to do it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because

the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that

doesn't cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.

Gob, he'd have a soft hand under a hen.



<P>Ga Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for

us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then

comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh

egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.



<P>-- Anyhow, says Joe. Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London

to ask about it on the floor of the House of Commons.



<P>-- Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see

him, as it happens.



<P>-- Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.



<P>-- That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr

Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?



<P>-- Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question

tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the

park. What do you think of that, citizen? <I>The Sluagh na h-Eireann</I>.



<P>Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat): Arising out of the question of

my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable

gentleman whether the Government has issued orders that these animals shall

be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological

condition?



<P>Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con): Honourable members are already in possession

of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel

I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member's

question is in the affirmative.



<P>Mr Orelli (Montenotte. Nat): Have similar orders been issued for the

slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Ph<oe>nix

park?



<P>Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.



<P>Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous Mitchelstown

telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the treasury bench? (O! O!)



<P>Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.



<P>Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.



<P>(Ironical opposition cheers.)



<P>The speaker: Order! Order!



<P>(The house rises. Cheers.)



<P>-- There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There

he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion

of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw,

citizen?



<P>-- <I>Na bacleis</I>, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There

was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.



<P>-- Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.



<P>-- Is that really a fact? says Alf.



<P>-- Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Do you not know that?



<P>So off they started about Irish sport and shoneen games the like of

the lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the

soil and building up a nation once again and all of that. And of course

Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent

exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from

the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: <I>Look at, Bloom. Do you see

that straw? That's a straw</I>. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for

an hour so he would and talk steady.



<P>A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of <I>Brian

O'Ciarnain's</I> in <I>Sraid na Bretaine Bheag</I>, under the auspices

of <I>Sluagh na h-Eireann</I>, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports

and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece

and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.

The venerable president of this noble order was in the chair and the attendance

was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman,

a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting

and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued

as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports

of our ancient panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected

worker in the cause o! our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an

eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and

pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated

to revive the best traditions of manly strength and power handed down to

us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause

and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought

the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty

plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering

of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar

to need recalling here) <I>A nation once again</I> in the execution of

which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction

to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative

form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the

timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass

vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enchanced his already international

reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience amongst which

were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives

of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings

then terminated.



<P>Amongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J.,

L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C.

S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev.

P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr.

Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman. O. D. C.; the rev. T. Maher,

S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery, V. F.;

the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.; the

rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A. Hackett,

C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr M'Manus, V. G.; the rev.

B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F.

T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev.

J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.



<P>-- Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett

match?



<P>-- No, says Joe.



<P>-- I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.



<P>-- Who? Blazes? says Joe.



<P>And says Bloom:



<P>-- What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training

of the eye.



<P>-- Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run

the odds and he swatting all the time.



<P>-- We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put

English gold in his pocket.



<P>-- True for you, says Joe.



<P>And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the

blood, asking Alf:



<P>-- Now don't you think, Bergan?



<P>-- Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was

only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating.

See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God,

he gave him one last puck in the wind. Queensberry rules and all, made

him puke what he never ate.



<P>It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled

to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he

was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative

skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both

champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret

in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights

and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose,

and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business leading off

with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting

out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked

but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine

one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his

man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing

him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner

where he was liberally drenched with water and, when the bell went, came

on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite

in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two

fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned

Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat

to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper

cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth

the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left

to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean

and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted

out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the

Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who

broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.



<P>-- He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's

running a concert tour now up in the north.



<P>-- He is, says Joe. Isn't he?



<P>-- Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer

tour, you see. Just a holiday.



<P>-- Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.



<P>-- My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success

too. He's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.



<P>Hoho begob, says I to myself, says I. That explains the milk in the

cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the tootle

on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island bridge

that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers.

Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what?

The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the bucko that'll organise

her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddereesh.



<P>Pride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There

grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The

gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed.

The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.



<P>And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloys, a comely hero

of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned

in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.



<P>-- Hello, Ned.



<P>-- Hello, Alf.



<P>-- Hello, Jack.



<P>-- Hello, Joe.



<P>-- God save you, says the citizen.



<P>-- Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?



<P>-- Half one, says Ned.



<P>So J. J. ordered the drinks.



<P>-- Were you round at the court? says Joe.



<P>-- Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.



<P>-- Hope so, says Ned.



<P>Now what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list

and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's.

Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their

eye, drinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders.

Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would

know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his

boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done,

says I. Gob, ye'll come home by weeping cross one of these days, I'm thinking.



<P>-- Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there, says Alf. U. p.

up.



<P>-- Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.



<P>-- Ay, says Ned, and he wanted right go wrong to address the court only

Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined

first.



<P>-- Ten thousand pounds, says Alf laughing. God I'd give anything to

hear him before a judge and jury.



<P>-- Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and

nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.



<P>-- Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.



<P>-- Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence

against you.



<P>-- Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not

<I>compos mentis</I>. U. p. up.



<P>-- <I>Compos</I> your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's

balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his

hat on with a shoehorn?



<P>-- Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment

for publishing it in the eyes of the law.



<P>-- Ha, ha, Alf, says Joe.



<P>-- Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.



<P>-- Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half

and half.



<P>-- How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he.



<P>-- Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish

nor flesh.



<P>-- Nor good red herring, says Joe.



<P>-- That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what

that is.



<P>Begob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explained he meant,

on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the

old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken

Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain.

And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin

of his old fellow's was pew opener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall

with his smashall sweeney's moustaches. The signor Brini from Summerhill,

the eyetallyano, papal zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and

gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and

passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates

bidding defiance to the world.



<P>-- And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held

to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove <I>v</I>.

Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.



<P>Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our

pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.



<P>-- Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.



<P>-- Good health, Ned, says J. J.



<P>-- There he is again, says Joe.



<P>-- Where? says Alf.



<P>And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter

and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in

as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand

coffin.



<P>-- How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.



<P>-- Remanded, says J. J.



<P>One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought

alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd

give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in

the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them

all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney

too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something

weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses

he was stuck for two quid.



<P>-- Who tried the case? says Joe.



<P>-- Recorder, says Ned.



<P>-- Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.



<P>-- Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears

of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve

in tears on the bench.



<P>-- Ay, says Alf. Reuben J. was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the

dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones for

the corporation there near Butt bridge.



<P>And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:



<P>-- A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?

Ten, did you say?



<P>-- Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid!



<P>-- And a wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately,

sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up

before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man!

I dismiss the case.



<P>And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess

and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,

the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter,

it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of

law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede

and master Justice Andrews sitting without a jury in the probate court,

weighed well and pondered the claims of the first chargeant upon the property

in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition

<I>in re</I> the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday,

vintner, deceased versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.

And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.

And he sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law

of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden

in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the

high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of

the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen

and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of

Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe

of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the

tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured

them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true

delivrance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the King

and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence

so help them God and kiss the books. And they rose in their seats, those

twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him who is from everlasting

that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the

law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice

had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled

him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred

a charge against him for he was a malefactor.



<P>-- Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland

filling the country with bugs.



<P>So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe telling

him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he

would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by

this and by that he'd do the devil and all.



<P>-- Because you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition.

That's the whole secret.



<P>-- Rely on me, says Joe.



<P>-- Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.

We want no more strangers in our house.



<P>-- O I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that

Keyes you see.



<P>-- Consider that done, says Joe.



<P>-- Very kind of you, says Bloom.



<P>-- The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come

in. We brought them. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon

robbers here.



<P>-- Decree <I>nisi</I>, says J. J.



<P>And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider's

web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him

and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.



<P>-- A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of

all our misfortunes.



<P>-- And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the <I>Police Gazette</I>

with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint. -- Give us a squint at

her, says I.



<P>And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows

off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct

of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty

but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting

herself and her fancy man feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper

bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing

the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.



<P>-- O Jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!



<P>-- There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef

off of that one, what?



<P>So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on

him as long as a late breakfast.



<P>-- Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action?

What did those tinkers in the cityhall at their caucus meeting decide about

the Irish language?



<P>O'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant

and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which

had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second

of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers

to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby

they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal

men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.



<P>-- It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal

Sassenachs and their <I>patois</I>.



<P>So J. J. puts in a word doing the toff about one story was good till

you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy putting your

blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach

a nation and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and

their colonies and their civilisation.



<P>-- Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them!

The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged

sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the

name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of

bastards' ghosts.



<P>-- The European family, says J. J...



<P>-- They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin

Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere

in Europe except in a <I>cabinet d'aisance</I>.



<P>And says John Wyse:



<P>-- Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.



<P>And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:



<P>-- <I>Conspuez les Anglais! Perde Albion!</I>



<P>He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands

the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan <I>Lamh

Dearg Abu</I>, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous

heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as

the deathless gods.



<P>-- What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that

had lost a bob and found a tanner.



<P>-- Gold cup, says he.



<P>-- Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.



<P>-- <I>Throwaway</I>, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And

the rest nowhere.



<P>-- And Bass's mare? says Terry.



<P>-- Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid

on my tip <I>Sceptre</I> for himself and a lady friend.



<P>-- I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on <I>Zinfandel</I> that Mr

Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.



<P>-- Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. <I>Throwaway</I>,

says he. Takes the biscuit and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name

is <I>Sceptre</I>.



<P>So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was

anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck

with his mangy snout up. Old mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.



<P>-- Not there, my child, says he.



<P>-- Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for

the other dog.



<P>And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking

in an odd word. -- Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others'

eyes but they can't see the beam in their own.



<P>-- <I>Raimeis</I>, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the

fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing

twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost

tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world!

And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax

and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries

and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin

that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford

tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing

like it in the whole wide world! Where are the Greek merchants that came

through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of

mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of

Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries,

Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our far-famed

horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering

to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the

yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths?

And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions

of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption.



<P>-- As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland

with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches,

firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading

a report of lord Castletown's...



<P>-- Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain

elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees

of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.



<P>-- Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.



<P>The fashionable international world attended <I>en masse</I> this afternoon

at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief

ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley.

Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly

Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees,

Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys

Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra

Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar,

Miss O. Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola

Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne,

Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma

Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride

who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely

charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on

an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and

finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved

by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss

Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very

becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty <I>motif</I> of plume rose

being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in

the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.

Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and,

in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new

and striking arrangement of <I>Woodman, spare that tree</I> at the conclusion

of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre <I>in Horto</I> after

the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire

of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries,

mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will

spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.



<P>-- And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with

Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped,

Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.



<P>-- And will again, says Joe.



<P>-- And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the

citizen, clapping his thigh. Our harbours that are empty will be full again,

Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry,

Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of

masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the O'Kennedys

of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor

Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish

battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none

of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the

province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three

sons of Milesius.



<P>And he took the last swig out of the pint, Moya. All wind and piss like

a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody

life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude

in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking

for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted

tenant.



<P>-- Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?



<P>-- An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.



<P>-- Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?



<P>-- Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.



<P>Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead

of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying

to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head

down like a bull at a gate. And another one: <I>Black Beast Burned in Omaha,

Ga</I>. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a sambo

strung up on a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they

ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to

make sure of their job.



<P>-- But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at

bay?



<P>-- I'Il tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it

is. Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on

the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself <I>Disgusted

One</I>.



<P>So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew

of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson

with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought

out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.



<P>-- A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir

John Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning

on the breech.



<P>And says John Wyse:



<P>-- 'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.



<P>Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane

and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till

he yells meila murder.



<P>-- That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses

the earth. The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary

chamber on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen

gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about

of drudges and whipped serfs.



<P>-- On which the sun never rises, says Joe.



<P>-- And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The

unfortunate yahoos believe it.



<P>They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth

and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,

born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified,

flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again

from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders

whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.



<P>But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere? I mean wouldn't

it be the same here if you put force against force?



<P>Didn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at

his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.



<P>-- We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater

Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black

47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by

the batteringram and the <I>Times</I> rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered

Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America.

Even the grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the Sassenach tried to starve

the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas

bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes.

Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to

the land of the free remember the land of bondage. And they will come again

and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions

of Kathleen ni Houlihan.



<P>-- Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...



<P>-- We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since

the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at

Killala.



<P>-- Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged

us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and

the broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the

wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in

Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.

But what did we ever get for it?



<P>-- The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know

what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they

trying to make an <I>Entente cordiale</I> now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty

with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were?



<P>-- <I>Conspuez les Fran&ccedil;ais</I>, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.



<P>-- And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't

we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George

the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead?



<P>Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old

one with the winkers on her blind drunk in her royal palace every night

of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting

her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers

and singing him old bits of songs about <I>Ehren on the Rhine</I> and come

where the boose is cheaper.



<P>-- Well! says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.



<P>-- Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more

pox than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!



<P>-- And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and

bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in his Satanic Majesty's

racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode.

The earl of Dublin, no less.



<P>-- They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little

Alf.



<P>And says J. J.:



<P>-- Considerations of space influenced their lordship's decision.



<P>-- Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.



<P>-- Yes, sir, says he, I will.



<P>-- You? says Joe.



<P>-- Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.



<P>-- Repeat that dose, says Joe.



<P>Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with

his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.



<P>-- Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.

Perpetuating national hatred among nations.



<P>-- But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.



<P>-- Yes, says Bloom.



<P>-- What is it? says John Wyse.



<P>-- A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same

place.



<P>-- By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm

living in the same place for the past five years.



<P>So of course everyone had a laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck

out of it:



<P>-- Or also living in different places.



<P>-- That covers my case, says Joe.



<P>-- What is your nation if I may ask, says the citizen.



<P>-- Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.



<P>The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,

gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.



<P>-- After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief

to swab himself dry.



<P>-- Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and

repeat after me the following words.



<P>The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth

attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors

of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth

prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces,

the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists

in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol a

bogoak sceptre, 8 North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than

the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden

eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing

our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning

and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as

delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic

fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely

lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and

the Twelve Pins, Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick,

the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough

Neagh's banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir

Patrick Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle,

the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore

jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice,

Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college

refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington,

the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal's

Cave - all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more

beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and

by the rich incrustations of time. -- Shove us over the drink, says I.

Which is which?



<P>-- That's mine, says Joe, as the devil laid to the dead policeman.



<P>-- And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.

Also now. This very moment. This very instant.



<P>Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.



<P>-- Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs

to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold

by auction off in Morocco like slaves or cattles.



<P>-- Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.



<P>-- I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.



<P>-- Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.



<P>That's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old

lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a sweepingbrush,

so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And then he collapses

all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.



<P>-- But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's

not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that

it's the very opposite of that that is really life.



<P>-- What? says Alf.



<P>-- Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says

he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there.

If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.



<P>Who's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.



<P>-- A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.



<P>-- Well, says John Wyse, isn't that what we're told? Love your neighbours.



<P>-- That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love,

Moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet. Love loves to love love.

Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell

loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair genteman. Li Chi

Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant.

Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the

turnedin eye. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.

His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper

loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves

that other person because everybody loves somebody but



<P>God loves everybody.



<P>-- Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.



<P>-- Hurrah, there, says Joe.



<P>-- The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.



<P>And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.



<P>-- We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.

What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women

and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text <I>God is love</I>

pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit

in the <I>United Irishman</I> today about that Zulu chief that's visiting

England?



<P>-- What's that? says Joe.



<P>So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts

reading out:



<P>-- A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented

yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting,

Lord Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British

traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. The delegation

partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in

the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain,

the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa

Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and

the British Empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions

an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's

greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great

squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the

Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to

the toast <I>Black and White</I> from the skull of his immediate predecessor

in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited

the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors'

book, subsequently executing an old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of

which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from

the girl hands.



<P>-- Widow woman, says Ned, I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that

bible to the same use as I would.



<P>-- Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful

land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.



<P>-- Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.



<P>-- No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only initialled:

P.



<P>-- And a very good initial too, says Joe.



<P>-- That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.



<P>-- Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the

Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what's

this his name is?



<P>-- Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.



<P>-- Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging

the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of

them.



<P>-- I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.



<P>-- Who? says I.



<P>-- Bloom, says he, the courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on <I>Throwaway</I>

and he's gone to gather in the shekels.



<P>-- Is it that whiteyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a

horse in anger in his life.



<P>-- That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to

back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the

tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's

the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse. -- He's a bloody dark horse

himself, says Joe.



<P>-- Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.



<P>-- There you are, says Terry.



<P>Goodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round to the back

of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was

letting off my (<I>Throwaway</I> twenty to) letting off my load gob says

I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in

Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is

five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) Pisser Burke was telling

me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about

a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube <I>she's better or

she's</I> (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won

or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation

says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's the last

of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.



<P>So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying

it was Bloom gave the idea for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper

all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off

of the Government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about

selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the

bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us

a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout.

Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before him perpetrating

frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself

with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and

his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Any amount of money advanced

on note of hand. Distance no object. No security. Gob he's like Lanty MacHale's

goat that'd go a piece of the road with everyone.



<P>-- Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll

tell you about it, Martin Cunningham.



<P>Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power

with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector

general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he

drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king's

expense.



<P>Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.



<P>-- Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.

Saucy knave! To us!



<P>So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.



<P>Mine host came forth at the summons girding him with his tabard.



<P>-- Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.



<P>-- Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds.

And for ourselves give us of your best for faith we need it.



<P>-- Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare

larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.



<P>-- How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant

countenance, so servest thou the king's messengers, Master Taptun?



<P>An instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.



<P>-- Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's messengers

(God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king's friends

(God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.



<P>-- Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman

by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?



<P>Mine host bowed again as he made answer:



<P>-- What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops

of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's

head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon

of old Rhenish?



<P>-- Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!



<P>-- Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare

larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.



<P>So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.



<P>-- Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.



<P>-- Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen

about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?



<P>-- That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.



<P>-- Who made those allegations? says Alf.



<P>-- I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.



<P>-- And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like

the next fellow?



<P>-- Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.



<P>-- Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the

hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.



<P>-- We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.



<P>-- Who is Junius? says J. J.



<P>-- He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it

was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know

that in the castle.



<P>-- Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.



<P>-- Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag. The

father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deed poll, the father

did.



<P>-- That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints

and sages!



<P>-- Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For

that matter so are we.



<P>-- Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be

their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe,

till he knows if he's a father or a mother.



<P>-- Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.



<P>-- O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of

his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying

a tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.



<P>-- <I>En ventre sa mere</I>, says J. J.



<P>-- Do you call that a man? says the citizen.



<P>-- I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.



<P>-- Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.



<P>-- And who does he suspect? says the citizen.



<P>Gob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings

he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache

like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm telling you? It'd be

an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him

in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off

with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give

us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.



<P>-- Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't

wait.



<P>-- A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he



<P>is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.



<P>-- Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.



<P>-- Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.



<P>-- You Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.



<P>-- Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert

us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our

shores.



<P>-- Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my

prayer.



<P>-- Amen, says the citizen.



<P>-- And I'm sure he will, says Joe.



<P>And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes,

thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the

blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and

monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi,

Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars

of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratesians, Servi, Trinitarians, and

the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children

of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and

other: and friars brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers,

minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic,

the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S. Wolstan:

and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the christian brothers

led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And after came all saints

and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and S. Isidore Arator and S.

James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S. Julian Hospitator and S.

Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and S. Stephen Protomartyr and

S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar

and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin

of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and S. Denis and S. Cornelius and

S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus

and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous

and S. Paronymous and S. Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James

of Dingle and Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine

and S. Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan

and S. Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan

and S. Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of

Brittany and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy

youth S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans

and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S.

Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr

and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother Louis

Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S. Martha of

Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and S. Attracta

and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and the Blessed Sister

Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S. Scholastica and S. Ursula

with eleven thousand virgins. And all came with nimbi and aureoles and

gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes

whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows,

loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells,

wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps,

bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline,

bells, crutches, forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones,

eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their

way by Nelson's Pillar, Henry Street, Mary Street, Capel Street, Little

Britain Street, chanting the introit in <I>Epiphania Domini</I> which beginneth

<I>Surge, illuminare</I> and thereafter most sweetly the gradual <I>Omnes</I>

which saith <I>de Saba venient</I> they did divers wonders such as casting

out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt

and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting

and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath

a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O'Flynn attended by

Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed

place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8,9 and 10 little

Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for

the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the

celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes

and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the

cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled

the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless

that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and

make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed

the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered

his prayers.



<P>-- <I>Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini</I>.



<P>-- <I>Que fecit c<oe>lum et terram</I>.



<P>-- <I>Dominus vobiscum</I>.



<P>-- <I>Et cum spiritu tuo</I>.



<P>And he laid his hands upon the blessed and gave thanks and he prayed

and they all with him prayed:



<P>-- <I>Deus, cuius vet sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde

super creaturas istas: et pasta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem

Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis

Tui corporis sanitatem et anima<oe> tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum

Dominum nostrum</I>.



<P>-- And so say all of us, says Jack.



<P>-- Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.



<P>-- Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.



<P>I was just looking round to see who the happy thought would strike when

be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.



<P>-- I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope

I'm not...



<P>-- No, says Martin, we're ready.



<P>Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.

Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's

a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to

five.



<P>-- Don't tell anyone, says the citizen.



<P>-- Beg your pardon, says he.



<P>-- Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along

now.



<P>-- Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's

a secret.



<P>And-he bloody dog woke up and let a growl.



<P>-- Bye bye all, says Martin.



<P>And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or

whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all

at sea up with them on the bloody jaunting car.



<P>Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.



<P>The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop,

the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward

with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew

nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble

bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when

he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each

one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth

speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the

smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, those willing

nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of

their foam: and the bark clave the waves.



<P>But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen

getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy and

he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish,

spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like

a leprechaun trying to peacify him.



<P>-- Let me alone, says he.



<P>And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls

out of him:



<P>-- Three cheers for Israel!



<P>Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake

and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's always

some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing.

Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.



<P>And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin

telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe

at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers

calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the

car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts

singing <I>If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew</I> and a slut shouts

out of her:



<P>-- Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!



<P>And says he:



<P>-- Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And

the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.



<P>-- He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.



<P>-- Whose God? says the citizen.



<P>-- Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was

a jew like me.



<P>Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.



<P>-- By Jesus, says he, I'Il brain that bloody jewman for using the holy

name. By Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.



<P>-- Stop! Stop! says Joe.



<P>A-large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from

the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell

to Nagyas&aacute;gos uram Lip&oacute;ti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander

Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the

distant clime of Sz&aacute;zharminczbroj&uacute;guly&aacute;s-Dugul&aacute;s

(Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great <I>&eacute;clat</I>

was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll

of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the

distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community

and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed

in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit

on the makers, Messrs Jacob <I>agus</I> Jacob. The departing guest was

the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being

visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown

strains of <I>Come back to Erin</I>, followed immediately by <I>Rakoczy's

March</I>. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of

the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain,

Sugar-loaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and

Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills,

the reeks of M'Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.

Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from

a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills,

the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral

tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large

numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of

barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in

salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeon-house.

<I>Visszontl&aacute;tl&aacute;s&aacute;ra, kedv&eacute;s bar&aacute;ton!

Visszontl&aacute;t&aacute;sra!</I> Gone but not forgotten.



<P>Gob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin

anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting

like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal theatre.



<P>-- Where is he till I murder him?



<P>And Ned and J. G. paralysed with the laughing.



<P>-- Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel.



<P>But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other

way and off with him.



<P>-- Hold one citizen, says Joe. Stop. Begob he drew his hand and made

a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he'd have

left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody

nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and

all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along

the street.



<P>The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory

of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli's

scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in

our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken

Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis

which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering

a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All

the lordly Tesidences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished

and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe

important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins

beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.

From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were

accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character.

An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected

clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with

gold handle with the engraved initials, coat of arms and house number of

the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner,

recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts

of the island, respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of

the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three

inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.

Other eyewitnesses depose that they-observed an incandescent object of

enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity

in a trajectory directed south west by west. Messages of condolence and

sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents

and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a

special <I>missa pro defunctis</I> shall be celebrated simultaneously by

the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal

dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage

of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called

away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of <I>debris</I> human

remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159, Great

Brunswick Street and Messrs T. C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80, North Wall,

assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry

under the general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral the right honourable

sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson K.G., K.P., H.T., P.C., K.C.B.,

M.P., J.P., M.B., D.S.O., S.O.D., M.F.H., M.R.I.A., B.L., Mus. Doc., P.L.G.,

F.T.C.D., F.R.U.I., F.R.C.P.I. and F.R.C.S.I.



<P>You never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that

lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he would

so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery

and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving

as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a volley

of oaths after him.



<P>-- Did I kill him, says he, or what?



<P>And he shouting to the bloody dog:



<P>-- After him, Garry! After him, boy!



<P>And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepface

on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back

for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. Hundred to

five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.



<P>When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld

the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in the

chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as

of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look

upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: <I>Elijah! Elijah!</I>

And he answered with a main cry: <I>Abba! Adonai!</I> And they beheld Him

even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of

the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe's in Little

Green Street like a shot off a shovel.

Ithaca</H1></CENTER>

WHAT PARALLEL COURSES DID BLOOM AND STEPHEN FOLLOW REturning?



<P>Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they

followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy

square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner's place

by an inadvertance as far as the farther corner of Temple street, north:

then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple

street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed

walking pace they crossed both the circus before George's church diametrically,

the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?



<P>Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution,

diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glow-lamps on the

growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency

dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish

nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day,

the male-cent influence of the presabbath, Stephen's collapse.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective

like and unlike reactions to experience?



<P>Both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to

plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner

of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated

by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance

professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social

and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding

influence of heterosexual magnetism.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Were their views on some points divergent?



<P>Stephen dissented openly from Bloom's view on the importance of dietary

and civic self help while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views

on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assented

covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning

the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism

by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope

Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts

in the reign of Cormac MacArt (266 A.D.) suffocated by imperfect deglutition

of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom

ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying

degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion

and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen

attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both

from two different points of observation, Sandycove and Dublin) at first

no bigger than a woman's hand.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?



<P>The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining

paraheliotropic trees.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations

in the past?



<P>In 1884 with Ower Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares

between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's corner and Synge

street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn

in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and

Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. In 1886 occasionally

with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front

parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently

with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and

separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once in

1892 and once in 1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the

parlour of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,

1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their

destination?



<P>He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual

development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction

of the converse domain of interindividual relations.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>As in what ways?



<P>From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:

existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence

to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What action did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?



<P>At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number

7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket

of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Was it there?



<P>It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn

on the day but one preceding.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why was he doubly irritated?



<P>Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded

himself twice not to forget.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively)

and inadvertently, keyless couple?



<P>To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Bloom's decision?



<P>A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the

area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the

lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length

of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the

area pavement, and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating

himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of

the fall.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did he fall?



<P>By his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois

measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing

in the premises of Francis Fraedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick

street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth

day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of

the Christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour,

mohammedan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number

$, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indication 2,

Julian period 6617, MXMIV.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did he rise uninjured by concussion?



<P>Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed

by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force

at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at

its fulcrum gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent

scullery, ignited a Lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal

gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating,

he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?



<P>Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent

kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 C P, a man lighting a candle,

a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen

holding a candle of ICP.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did the man reappear elsewhere?



<P>Alter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible

through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.

The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway

the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did Stephen obey his sign?



<P>Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed

softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted candle

past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning

staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's house.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What did Bloom do?



<P>He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its

flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen

with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary,

knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped

sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram

coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M'Donald

of 14 D'Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with

one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained

in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into

free union with the oxygen of the air.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?



<P>Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,

had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college

of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare:

of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence

in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate

Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's

Island: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number

twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis-Xavier

1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics' theatre of university

College, 16 Stephen's green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his

father's house in Cabra.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from

the fire towards the opposite wall?



<P>Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched

between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier,

from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached

consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies' grey hose

with lisle suspendertops and feet in their habitual position clamped by

three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at

their point of junction.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What did Bloom see on the range?



<P>On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger)

hob a black iron kettle.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What did Bloom do at the range?



<P>He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle

to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it

flow.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did it flow?



<P>Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity

of 2,400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of

filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant

cost of #5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the

Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance

of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by

a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson

street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2

million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir

for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer

Harty, C.E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee, had prohibited

the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption

(envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the importable water

of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin

Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper

supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000

gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the

law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting

to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers,

solvent, sound.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning

to the range, admire?



<P>Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature

in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's projection:

its umplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding

8,000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting

in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the

variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic

turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its

sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic

and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land

of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over

all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular

stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: Its capacity to

dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including billions

of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and

downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume

and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation

of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular

ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing

rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents: gulfstream, north

and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian

wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds,

waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations,

deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its

secrecy in springs, and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric

instruments and exemplified by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation

of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent

parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues:

its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness

in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties

for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility

as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,

sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms

in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls

and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries

and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility

in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations,

bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if

navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from

harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine

fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe) numerically, if not literally,

the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90% of the human

body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential

fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he

return to the stillflowing tap?



<P>To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington's

lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered (bought thirteen hours

previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging

everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered

holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer?



<P>That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total

by submersion in cold water (his last bath having taken place in the month

of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of

glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic

to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of

the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face

and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing,

the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach,

and thenar or sole of foot?



<P>The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.&nbsp;

<HR width="50%">



<P>What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?



<P>Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric

energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the

lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?



<P>Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and

recuperation.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the

agency of fire?



<P>The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation

between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from

the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal,

containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of

primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from

the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent

luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed

by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source

of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated

through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected,

in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature

of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible

as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise I pound

of water from 50<O> to 212<O> Fahrenheit.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?



<P>A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid

at both sides simultaneously.



<P>For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?



<P>To shave himself.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What advantages attended shaving by night?



<P>A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from

shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly

encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours:

quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when

awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and

perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman's double knock, a paper read,

reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with

thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster

rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut

and humected and applied adhered which was to be done.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noises



<P>Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine

feminine passive active hand.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?



<P>The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human

blood even when the end justified the means, preferring in their natural

order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the

kitchen dresser opened by Bloom?



<P>On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast

saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted,

and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, and open shammy

purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic violet comfits.

On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table

salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot

of Plumtree's potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and

containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co's

white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper,

a packet of Epps's soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch's choice tea

at 2/- per lb. in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing

the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one the larger, Spanish,

entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and

more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy's cream, a jug of brown crockery

containing a noggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted

by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added

to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom's and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts

made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves,

a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the

upper shelf a battery of jamjars of various sizes and proveniences.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?



<P>Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered

887, 886.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?



<P>Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative

of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive

result of which he had read in the <I>Evening Telegraph</I>, late pink

edition, in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected,

been received by him?



<P>In Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street:

in David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O'Connell street

lower, outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had placed in his hand a

throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the

church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F. W. Sweny and

Co (Limited) dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons

had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy

of the current issue of the <I>Freeman's Journal</I> and <I>National Press</I>

which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had

proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11

Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance

and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language

of prediction.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?



<P>The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event

followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the

electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by

failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally

from a successful interpretation.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>His mood?



<P>He hid not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed,

he was satisfied.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What satisfied him?



<P>To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain

to others. Light to the gentiles.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?



<P>He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's

soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed

on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed

ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his

guest?



<P>Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation

Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he

substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily

to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily

reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?



<P>His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted

them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct,

the creature cocoa.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,

reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete

the act begun?



<P>The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right

side of his guest's jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four lady's

handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Who drank more quickly?



<P>Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation ad taking,

from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady

flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one, six to two,

nine to three.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?



<P>Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was

engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from

literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied

to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of

difficult problems in imaginary or real life.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Had he found their solution?



<P>In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,

aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text,

the answers not bearing on all points.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him,

potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering

of three prizes at 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively by the <I>Shamrock</I>,

a weekly newspaper?

<BLOCKQUOTE>An ambition to squint

<BR>At my verses in print

<BR>Makes me hope that for these you'll find room.

<BR>If you so condescend

<BR>Then please place at the end

<BR>The name of yours truly, L. Bloom.</BLOCKQUOTE>



<HR width="50%">



<P>Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?



<P>Name, age, race, creed.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?



<P>Leopold Bloom



<P>Ellpodbomool



<P>Molldopeloob.



<P>Bollo edoom



<P>Old Ollebo, M. P.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic

poet) sent to Miss Marion Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?

<BLOCKQUOTE>Poets oft have sung in rhyme

<BR>Of music sweet their praise divine.

<BR>Let them hymn it nine times nine.

<BR>Bearer far than song or wine,

<BR>You are mine. The world is mine.</BLOCKQUOTE>



<HR width="50%">



<P>What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G.

Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual years,

entitled <I>If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now</I>,

commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48,

49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley

of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual

Christmas pantomime <I>Sinbad the Sailor</I> (written by Greenleaf Whittier,

scenery by George A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss

Whelan, produced by R. Shelton 26 December 1892 under the personal supervision

of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto)

and sung by Nelly Bouverist principal girl?



<P>Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest,

the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837)

and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly,

apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the

respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses, the duke and duchess of York

(real), and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary); thirdly, a conflict

between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the

recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre

Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion

for Nelly Bouverist's non-intellectual, non-political, nontopical expression

of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist's revelations

of white articles of nonintellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing

while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties

of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from <I>Everybody's

Book of Jokes</I> (1,000 pages and a laugh in every one); sixthly, the

rhymes homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new

lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new

solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What relation existed between their ages?



<P>16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen

was 6.16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present age

Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their

ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the

proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary

future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued

immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen

was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom

then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained

the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having

been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum

antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would

continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D.,

Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been

obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What events might nullify these calculations?



<P>The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a

new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination

of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?



<P>Two. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina

Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's mother,

Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation.

The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on a rainy Sunday in the

January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father and Stephen's granduncle,

Stephen being then 5 years older.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and

afterwards seconded by the father?



<P>Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative

gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal

a third connecting link between them?



<P>Mrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house

of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had

also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel

owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where during parts of the

years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided

also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of

Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent

Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?



<P>He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow

of independent, if limited means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow

revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road

opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had remained for a

certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable

citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles, equipped with inflated pneumatic

tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts,

ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and <I>vice

versa</I>.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?



<P>Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel

of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual

changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes,

vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the

rim of a round precipitous globe.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?



<P>The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositions

wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness:

the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate

Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and

for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation

which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the

more desirable?



<P>The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently

abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's <I>Physical Strength and How To

Obtain It</I> which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in

sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front

of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and

produce successively a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination

of juvenile agility.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?



<P>Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full

circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had

excelled in his table and protracted execution of the half lever movement

on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal

muscles.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did either openly allude to their racial difference?



<P>Neither.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts

about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's

thoughts about Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?



<P>He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he

knew that he knew that he was not.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?



<P>Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently

Rudolf Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin

and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and

Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty); Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial

heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard

and Christina Goulding (born Grier).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or

layman?



<P>Bloom (three times) by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A. alone in

the protestant church of Saint Nicolas Without, Coombe; by James O'Connor,

Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village

of Swords; and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in the church of the

Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone,

C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did they find their educational careers similar?



<P>Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively

through a dame's school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for Stephen

Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior,

middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation,

first arts, second arts and arts degree course of the royal university.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university

of life?



<P>Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation

had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What two temperaments did they individually represent?



<P>The scientific. The artistic.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards

applied, rather than towards pure, science?



<P>Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining

in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation

of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary for example,

the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew,

the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and

sluice, the suction pump.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of

kindergarten?



<P>Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,

catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve

constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical

orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with

zoological biscuits, globemap playingballs, historically costumed dolls.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What also stimulated him in his cogitations?



<P>The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James,

the former by his 1d. bazaar at 42 George's street, South, the latter at

his 6 1/2d. shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry

street, admission 2d., children 1d.; and the infinite possibilities hitherto

unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral

monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally

of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest

involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Such as?



<P>K. 11. Kino's 111- Trousers.



<P>House of Keys. Alexander J. Keyes.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Such as not?



<P>Look at this long candle. Calculate when it burns out and you receive

gratis I pair of our special non-compo boots, guaranteed I candle power.

<P>Bacilikil (Insect Powder).



<P>Veribest (Boot Blacking).



<P>Uwantit (Combined pocket twoblade penknife with corkscrew, nailfile

and pipecleaner).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Such as never?



<P>What is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat?



<P>Incomplete.



<P>With it an abode of bliss.



<P>Manufactured by George Plumtree, 23 Merchants' quay, Dublin, put up

in 4 oz. pots, and inserted by Councillor Joseph P. Nannetti, M. P., Rotunda

Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and anniversaries

of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A plumtree is a meatpot,

registered trade mark. Beware of imitations. Peatmot. Trumplee. Montpat.

Plamtroo.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality,

though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?



<P>His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn

by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated

engaged in writing.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?



<P>Solitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark

corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She sits.

She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks. On solitary

hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs. Wheels and hoofs.

She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He seizes solitary paper.

He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads. Solitary



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What?



<P>In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen's hotel, Queen's hotel, Queen's

Ho...



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?



<P>The Queen's Hotel, Ennis, County, Glare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf

Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated,

in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in

the form of a neuralgic liniment, composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment

to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the morning

of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street,

Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at

3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra

smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at

the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general

drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?



<P>Coincidence.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?



<P>He preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's words

by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to

him, described by the narrator as <I>A Pisgah Sight of Palestine</I> or

<I>The Parable of the Plums?</I>



<P>It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent

by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms

(e.g. <I>My Favourite Hero</I> or <I>Procrastination is the Thief of Time</I>)

composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in

conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial,

social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected

as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory

and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the

precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon's <I>Studies in Blue</I>,

to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally

as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative

of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement,

during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice

on the day but three following, videlict, Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius

Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently

engaged his mind?



<P>What to do with our wives.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?



<P>Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spillikins, cup and ball,

nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess

or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing

society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and

piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety

entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly

obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan:

the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels,

state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent

prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence,

to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity:

courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction

agreeable.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined

him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?



<P>In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper

with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and

Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals

as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of

a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political complications,

internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating the addenda of

bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After completion of laconic

epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the

encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol

and nutgall. Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically

or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), <I>alias</I>

(a mendacious person mentioned in sacred Scripture).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these

and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?



<P>The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances,

proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment

regarding one person, proved true by experiment.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?



<P>Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at

a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent

knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's ignorant

lapse.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>With what success had he attempted direct instruction?



<P>She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest,

comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty

remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with

error.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What system had proved more effective?



<P>Indirect suggestion implicating self-interest.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Example?



<P>She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked

new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with

rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Accepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples

of postexilic eminence did he adduce?



<P>Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author

of <I>More Neubkim</I> (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of

such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose

none like Moses (Maimonides).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth

seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by

Stephen?



<P>That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,

name uncertain.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of

a selected or rejected race mentioned?



<P>Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),

Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages

were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest

to host and by host to guest?



<P>By Stephen: <I>suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus, suil go

cuin</I> (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).



<P>By Bloom: <I>Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch</I> (thy

temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages

made in substantiation of the oral comparison?



<P>On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style,

entitled <I>Sweets of Sin</I> (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that

its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil

(supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee,

em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters

ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted goph, explaining

their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3,

1,4 and 100.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the

extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?



<P>Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence

and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What points of contact existed between these languages and between the

peoples who spoke them?



<P>The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and

servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught

on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted

by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant

of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archeological, genealogical,

hagiographical, exegetical, homilectic, toponomastic, historical and religious

literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna

and Ghemara) Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote,

Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival

and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites

in ghetto (S. Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's tavern): the

proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and Jewish dress

acts: the restoration in Chanan David of Zion and the possibility of Irish

political autonomy or devolution.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple,

ethnically irreductible consummation?

<BLOCKQUOTE>Kolod balejwaw pnimali

<BR>Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?



<P>In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency? By a periphrastic

version of the general text.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?



<P>The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic

hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern

stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic)

and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did the guest comply with his host's request?



<P>Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What was Stephen's auditive sensation?



<P>He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation

of the past.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What was Bloom's visual sensation?



<P>He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What were Stephen's and Bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations

of concealed identities?



<P>Visually, Stephen's: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted

by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic,

sesquipedalian with winedark hair.



<P>Auditively, Bloom's: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with

what exemplars?



<P>In the church, Roman, Anglican, or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very

reverend John Conmee S.J., the reverend T. Salmon, D.D., provost of Trinity

college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars,

Seymour Bushe, K.C., Rufus Isaacs, K.C. On the stage, modern or Shakespearean

exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle (1901), exponent

of Shakespeare.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange

legend on an allied theme?



<P>Reassuringly, their place where none could hear them talk being secluded,

reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment

of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having

been consumed.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend?

<BLOCKQUOTE>d Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for

to play ball

<BR>And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played

<BR>He drove it o'er the jew's garden wall.

<BR>And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played

<BR>He broke the jew's windows all.</BLOCKQUOTE>

How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?



<P>With unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw

the unbroken kitchen window.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Then out there came the jew's daughter

<BR>And she all dressed in green.

<BR>`Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,

<BR>And play your ball again.'



<P>`I can't come back and I won't come back

<BR>Without my schoolfellows all,

<BR>For if my master he did hear

<BR>He'd make it a sorry ball.'



<P>She took him by the lilywhite hand

<BR>And led him along the hall

<BR>Until she led him to a room

<BR>Where none could hear him call.



<P>She took a penknife out of her pocket

<BR>And cut off his little head,

<BR>And now he'll play his ball no more

<BR>For he lies among the dead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?



<P>With mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew's

daughter, all dressed in green.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Condense Stephen's commentary.

<BR>One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by inadvertence,

twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is abandoned

and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth holds

him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel

apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?



<P>He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him

should by him not be told.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?



<P>In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?



<P>He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the

incitation of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation

of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the

influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency,

the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not

totally immune?



<P>From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping

apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable

of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body

had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and,

having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated in night attire

had lain, sleeping.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member

of his family?



<P>Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent

(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation

of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night

attire with a vacant mute expression.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What other infantile memories had he of her?



<P>15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and

lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her

moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons one, tloo, tlee: a

doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond

ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate,

a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What endemic characteristics were present?



<P>Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line

of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals

to its most distant intervals.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What memories had he of her adolescence?



<P>She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's lawn

entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and

take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South Circular

road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister

aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason

of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth

she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion

to a local student (faculty and year not stated).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?



<P>Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly

if differently?



<P>A temporary departure of his cat.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why similarly, why differently?



<P>Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male

(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because

of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>In other respects were their differences similar?



<P>In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>As?



<P>Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it

for her (cf. neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake

in Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit,

describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy

of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf. mousewatching

cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences

of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf. earwashing

cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered

conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she

had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have

accepted (cf. hearthdreaming cat). Hence in passivity, in economy, in the

instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>In what way had he utilised gifts 1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as matrimonial

auguries, to interest and to instruct her?



<P>As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous

animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision,

the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum,

exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of

human or social regulation of the various positions clockwise of movable

indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour

of an instant in each hour, when the longer and the shorter indicator were

at the same angle of inclination, <I>videlicet</I>, 5 5/11 minutes past

each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>In what manners did she reciprocate?



<P>She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to

him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown Derby porcelain ware. She

provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made

by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating

his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by

him not for her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual

acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth

part.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist,

make to Stephen, noctambulist?



<P>To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and

Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately

above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of

his host and hostess.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation

of such extemporisation?



<P>For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the

host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the hostess:

disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and

a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality

of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's daughter?



<P>Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through

daughter.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest

return a monosyllabic negative answer?



<P>If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney

Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the

host?



<P>A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment

of Mrs Mary Dedalus, born Goulding, 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary

of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Was the proposal of asylum accepted?



<P>Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What exchange of money took place between host and guest?



<P>The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money

(1.7s.0.), one pound seven shillings, advanced by the latter to the former.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,

declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?



<P>To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the

residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction,

place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a series of static,

semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence

of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the

Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and E. Connery, proprietors),

the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity

Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of

a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares,

the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if

both speakers were resident in different places).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually

selfexcluding propositions?



<P>The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler's

circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured

clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in

the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared

to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown's) papa.

The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom)

had marked a florin (2s.) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered

it in payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family

grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters

of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Was the clown Bloom's son?



<P>No.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Had Bloom's coin returned?



<P>Never.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?



<P>Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to

amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and

international animosity.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating

these conditions?



<P>There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct

from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of

destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of

the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and

death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females

extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents

at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their

resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality,

decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis

of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located

in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions

of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why did he desist from speculation?



<P>Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other

more acceptable phenomena in place of the less acceptable phenomena to

be removed.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did Stephen participate in his dejection?



<P>He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding

syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational

reagent between a micro- and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the

incertitude of the void.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?



<P>Not verbally. Substantially.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What comforted his misapprehension?



<P>That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from

the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>I n what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus

from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?

<BLOCKQUOTE>Lighted Candle in Stick borne by

<BR>BLOOM.

<BR>Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by

<BR>STEPHEN.</BLOCKQUOTE>



<HR width="50%">



<P>With what intonation <I>secreto</I> of what commemorative psalm?



<P>The 113th, <I>modus peregrinus: In exitu Isra&euml;l de Egypto: domus

Jacob de populo barbaro.</I>



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What did each do at the door of egress?



<P>Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?



<P>For a cat.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest,

emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere

of the house into the penumbra of the garden?



<P>The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion

of various constellations?



<P>Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible

in incipent lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous

scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer

placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk

from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis

Major) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900

times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes:

of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our

solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars

such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation

of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars,

in reality evermoving from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote

futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted

human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?



<P>Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of

the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed

in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds,

of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable

trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained

by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe

of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes

of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its

universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible

in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever

diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried

far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?



<P>Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem

of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number

computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of

so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result

having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of

innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned

in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units,

tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions,

tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula

of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of

being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its

powers.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did he find the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and their

satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and

moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?



<P>Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism,

normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when

elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered

with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation

between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated, from nasal hemorrhage,

impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution

he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible

that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of

beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian,

Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though

an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences

resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there

as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities

of vanities and all that is vanity.



<P>

<HR width="50%">

<BLOCKQUOTE>And the problem of possible redemption?

<BR>The minor was proved by the major.</BLOCKQUOTE>



<HR width="50%">



<P>Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?



<P>The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,

yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their

magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner's

star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn:

the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations

of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon

Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted

by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution:

the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical

egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal

origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of

the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric

showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10 August):

the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms:

the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a

star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day

(a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence

of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare

over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and

of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but lesser brilliancy which

had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis

about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably)

similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared

from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen

Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the

birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations

some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant

phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement

of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence

of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity

of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>His (Bloom's) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing

for possible error?



<P>That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not

a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the

known to the unknown: an infinity, renderable equally finite by the suppositions

probable apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different

magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised

in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its

future spectators had entered actual present existence.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?



<P>Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the

delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking

ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of

their planet.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological

influences upon sublunary disasters?



<P>It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature

employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition

as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf

of dews, the ocean of fecundity.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and

woman?



<P>Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations:

her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection:

her constancy under all her phases, rising, and setting by her appointed

times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate

response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and

refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty,

to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability

of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent

propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light,

her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas,

her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom's, who attracted Stephen's

gaze?



<P>In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a paraffin

oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied

by Frank O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer,

16 Aungier street.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible person, his wife Marion

(Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?



<P>With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued

affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Boa then were silent?



<P>Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal

flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Were they indefinitely inactive?



<P>At Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen,

then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs

of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition,

their gazes, first Bloom's, then Stephen's, elevated to the projected luminous

and semiluminous shadow.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Similarly?



<P>The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations

were dissimilar: Bloom's longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of

the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year

at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest

altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210

scholars: Stephen's higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of

the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical

pressure.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the

invisible audible collateral organ of the other?



<P>To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity,

dimension, sanitariness, pelosity. To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal

integrity of Jesus circumcised (1st January, holiday of obligation to hear

mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether

the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic

church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of

the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences

as hair and toenails.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?



<P>A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament

from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress

of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?



<P>By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an

unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning

its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling

inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture

for free egress and free ingress.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?



<P>Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its

base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming

any angle less than the sum of two right angles.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their

(respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?



<P>The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells

in the church of Saint George.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?



<P>By Stephen:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.

<BR>Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.</BLOCKQUOTE>

By Bloom:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Heigho, heigho,

<BR>Heigho, heigho.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day

at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south

to Glasnevin in the north?



<P>Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed),

Tom Kernan (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry

Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy

Dignam (in the grave).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Alone, what did Bloom hear?



<P>The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth,

the double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Alone, what did Bloom feel?



<P>The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing

point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or R&eacute;aumur:

the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind

him?



<P>Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy

Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis

Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip

Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordi&amp;Aelig;

hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?



<P>The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of day-break, the

apparition of a new solar disk.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?



<P>Once, in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house

of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of

the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction

of Mizrach, the east.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>He remembered the initial paraphenomena?



<P>More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at

various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the

visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first

golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did he remain?



<P>With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering

the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the

candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room,

hallfloor, and reentered.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What suddenly arrested his ingress?



<P>The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into

contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible

fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence

of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles

of furnitures?



<P>A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite

the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration

which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker

inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place

vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle

of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its

position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position

in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of

the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white

checker inlaid majolicatopped table.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Describe them.



<P>One: a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted

to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular

fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered

seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other:

a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite

the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished

dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What significances attached to these two chairs?



<P>Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial

evidence, of testimonial supermanence.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?



<P>A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting

a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray containing

four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured

ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G

natural for voice and piano of <I>Love's Old Sweet Song</I> (words by G.

Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling)

open at the last page with the final indications ad <I>libitum, forte</I>,

pedal, <I>animato</I>, sustained, pedal, <I>ritirando</I>, close.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?



<P>With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right

temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focusing his gaze on a large

dull passive and slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and

downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi

Mulligan's scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure,

repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels

of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion

of gradual discolouration.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>His next proceeding?



<P>From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive

cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin

plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced

from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath

Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a

thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to

the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed

the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part

in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What followed this operation?



<P>That truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted

a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?



<P>A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46

a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf

tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial

gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman

John Hooper.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and

Bloom?



<P>In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of

the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the

mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy

wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with

obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial

gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?



<P>The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why solitary (ipsorelative)?

<BLOCKQUOTE>Brothers and sisters had he none,

<BR>Yet that man's father was his grandfather's son.</BLOCKQUOTE>



<HR width="50%">



<P>Why mutable (aliorelative)?



<P>From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.

From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal creator.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?



<P>The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged

and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles

on the two bookshelves opposite.

<HR width="50%">



<P>What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of

the inverted volumes?



<P>The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its

place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the

incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined

in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath

or between the pages of a book.

<HR width="50%">



<P>Which volume was the largest in bulk?



<P>Hozier's <I>History of the Russo - Turkish War</I>.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What among other data did the second volume of the work In question

contain?



<P>The name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by

a decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?



<P>Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after

an interval of amnesia, when seated at the central table, about to consult

the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the military

engagement, Plevna.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?



<P>The candour, nudity, pose, tranquillity, youth, grace, sex, counsel

of a statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus purchased

by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?



<P>Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two

articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic

to alterations of mass by expansion.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>How was the irritation allayed?



<P>He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible

stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He unbuttoned

successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest

along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hair extending in

triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of

the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to

the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebr&amp;Aelig;, thence produced

both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two

equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences.

He unbraced successively each of six minus one braced trouser buttons,

arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What involuntary actions followed?



<P>He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice

in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting

inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched

imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various

points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin. He inserted

his left hand into the left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted

and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling), placed there (presumably) on the

occasion (17 October 1903) of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney

Parade.

<HR width="50%">



<P>Did the process of divestiture continue?



<P>Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended

his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient

points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several

different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked

and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time,

detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which

the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and,

having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock,

placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair,

picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail,

raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the

quick, then with satisfaction threw away the lacerated unguinal fragment.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why with satisfaction?



<P>Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other

unguinal fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs

Ellis's juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief genuflection

and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>In what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions

now coalesced?

<P>What might be the name of this erigible or erected residence?



<P>Bloom Cottage. Saint Leopold's. Flowerville.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Could Bloom of 7 Eccles street foresee Bloom of Flowerville?



<P>In loose allwool garments with Harris tweed cap, price 8/6, and useful

garden boots with elastic gussets and wateringcan, planting aligned young

firtrees, syringing, pruning, staking, sowing hayseed, trundling a weedladen

<HR width="50%">



<P>What syllabus of intellectual pursuits was simultaneously possible?

ascents of moderately high hills, natation in secluded fresh water and

unmolested river boating in secure wherry or light curricle with kedge

anchor on reaches free from weirs and rapids (period of estivation), vespertinal

perambulation or equestrian circumprocession with inspection of sterile

landscape and contrastingly agreeable cottagers' fires of smoking peat

turves (period of hibernation). Indoor discussion in tepid security of

unsolved historical and criminal problems: lecture of unexpurgated exotic

erotic masterpieces: house carpentry with toolbox containing hammer, awl,

nails, screws, tintacks, gimlet, tweezers, bullnose plane and turnscrew.



<P>Might he become a gentleman farmer of field produce and live stock?



<P>Not impossibly, with 1 or 2 stripper cows, 1 pike of upland hay and

requisite farming implements, e.g., an end-to-end churn, a turnip pulper

etc.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What would be his civic functions and social status among the county

families and landed gentry?



<P>Arranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order, that

of gardener, groundsman, cultivator, breeder, and at the zenith of his

career, resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest

and coat of arms and appropriate classical motto (<I>Semper paratus</I>),

duly recorded in the court directory (Bloom, Leopold P., M. P., P. C.,

K. P., L. L. D. <I>honoris cause</I>, Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned

in court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have left

Kingstown for England).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?



<P>A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the dispensation

in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly rearranged

in terms of greater and lesser social inequality of unbiassed homogeneous

indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude

but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real

and personal, to the crown. Loyal to the highest constituted power in the

land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict

maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of

all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary

solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding

of the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all

traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and

regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings)

of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international

persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial

molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic

connubiality.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.



<P>To master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his disbelief

in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his father Rudolf

Virag, later Rudolph Bloom, had been converted from the Israelitic faith

and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting Christianity among the

Jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of Roman catholicism at the

epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in 1888. To Daniel Magrane and

Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship (terminated by the premature

emigration of the former) he had advocated during nocturnal perambulations

the political theory of colonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary

theories of Charles Darwin, expounded in <I>The Descent of Man</I> and

<I>The Origin of Species</I>. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence

to the collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan

Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X. O'Brien and others, the

<P>What eventually would render him independent of such wealth?



<P>The independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?



<P>It was one or his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic relation

to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil recollection of

the past when practised habitually before retiring for the night alleviated

fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and renovated vitality.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>His justifications?



<P>As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human

life at least 2/7ths, viz., 20 years passed in sleep. As a philosopher

he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal

part of any person's desires has been realised. As a physiologist he believed

in the artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative during

somnolence.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What did he fear?



<P>The committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of

the light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated

in the cerebral convolutions.

<P>What were habitually his final meditations?



<P>Of some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in wonder,

<P>

<HR width="50%">

<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia

did these objects evoke in Bloom?



<P>An old man widower, unkempt hair, in bed, with head covered, sighing:

an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses of grains

and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death

of a septuagenarian suicide by poison.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?



<P>Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain

beliefs and practices.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>As?



<P>The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal, the hebdomadary

symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist

excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character

of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaron: the sanctity

of the sabbath.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?



<P>Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than

other beliefs and practices now appeared.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?



<P>Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6)

a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between

Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely, with statements

of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresa, empress of

Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of

pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves). Leopold Bloom (aged

6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical

map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated

business premises in the various centres mentioned.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations

in narrator and listener?



<P>In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of

narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of

the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What idiosyncrasies of the narrator were concomitant product$ of amnesia?



<P>Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat. Occasionally

he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate.

Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a

lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.&nbsp;

<HR width="50%">



<P>What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?



<P>The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon

repletion.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?



<P>The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession

of scrip.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which

these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values

to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.



<P>Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor

hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful

debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy: that of the

fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1s. 4d. in the #, sandwichman,

distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, insinuating sycophant, maimed

sailor, blind stripling, superannuated bailiff's man, marfeast, lickplate,

spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of

public park under discarded perforated umbrella. Destitution: the inmate

of Old Man's House (Royal Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson's

Hospital for reduced but respectable men permanently disabled by gout or

want of sight. Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported

moribund lunatic pauper.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>With which attendant indignities?



<P>The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt

of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated

ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed

vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles,

worth little or nothing or less than nothing.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>By what could such a situation be precluded?



<P>By decease (change of state), by departure (change of place).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Which preferably?



<P>The latter, by the line of least resistance.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable?



<P>Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects.

The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity

to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What considerations rendered it not irrational?



<P>The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which

being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if

now disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication,

which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties,

which was impossible.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What considerations rendered it desirable?



<P>The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad,

as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in

special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>In Ireland?



<P>The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with

submerged petrified city, the Giant's Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle,

the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the pastures of royal

Meath, Brigid's elm in Kildare, the Queen's Island shipyard in Belfast,

the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Abroad?



<P>Ceylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for

Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing lane, London, E. C., 5 Dame street,

Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate of Damascus,

goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique birthplace of

Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues, nude Grecian divinities),

the Wall street money market (which controlled international finance),

the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where O'Hara of the camerons had

slain the bull), Niagara (over which no human being had passed with impunity),

the land of the Eskimos (eaters of soap), the forbidden country of Thibet

(from which no traveller returns), the bay of Naples (to see which was

to die), the Dead Sea.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Under what guidance, following what signs?



<P>At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of

intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Major produced

and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled triangle

formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha delta of

Ursa Major. On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed in imperfect

varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice of the imperfectly

occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating female, a pillar of

the cloud by day.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed?



<P>#5 reward lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street,

missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy),

height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since

<P>What tributes his?



<P>Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph immortal,

beauty, the bride of Noman.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?



<P>Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary

orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets,

astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing

from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere imperceptibly

he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of

recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown

he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia

and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger,

a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened,

with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild

or of the silver King.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What would render such return irrational?



<P>An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through

reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible

time.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?



<P>The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of

the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering

perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of

an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human)

tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and rendering desirable:

the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an unoccupied

bed?



<P>The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human (mature

female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of matutinal

contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the case of trousers

accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress (striped)

and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of accumulated

fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?



<P>The preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion

and premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John):

the funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes (Urim

and Thummin): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchizedek): the visit

to museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along Bedford

Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a truculent troglodyte

in Bernard Kiernan's premises (holocaust): a blank period of time including

a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking (wilderness):

the eroticism produced by feminine exhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged

delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly

house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl

and chance medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation

to and from the cabman's shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as

to conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?



<P>The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted

by the insentient material of a strainveined timber table.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured

multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?



<P>Who was M'Intosh?



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30

years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction

of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?



<P>Where was Moses when the candle went out?



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, silently, successively,

enumerate?



<P>A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement, to obtain

a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook, Robertson

and Co, 5 Dame street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing lane, London, E. C.), to certify

the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in the case of Hellenic

female divinities, to obtain admission (gratuitous or paid) to the performance

of Leah by Mrs Bandman Palmer at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49, South

King street.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?

Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin's Barn.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What recurrent impressions of the same were possible by the hypothesis?



<P>Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street,

with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines meeting at infinity,

if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from infinity, with constant

uniform retardation, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens

street, returning.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were perceived

by him?



<P>A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose, a pair of new violet

garters, a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of India mull, cut on generous

lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti's Turkish cigarettes

and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded curvilinear, a camisole

of baptiste with thin lace border, an accordion underskirt of blue silk

moirette, all these objects being disposed irregularly on the top of a

rectangular trunk, quadruple battened, having capped corners, with multicoloured

labels, initialled on its fore side in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian

Cooper Tweedy).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What impersonal objects were perceived?



<P>A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne cutting,

apple design, on which rested a lady's black straw hat. Orangekeyed ware,

bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery manufacturer,

21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed irregularly on the washstand and floor,

and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together),

pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Bloom's acts?



<P>He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining

articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the

bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the

proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the

foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>How?



<P>With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or

not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress

being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous

under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust

or adder: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception

and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of

sleep and of death.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?



<P>New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form,

female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs,

some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>If he had smiled why would he have smiled?



<P>To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first

to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even

if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,

last, only and alone, whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor

alone in a series originating In and repeated to infinity.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What preceding series?



<P>Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell

d'Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father

Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society's Horse Show, Maggot

O'Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin),

Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman

in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser)

Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady,

Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office,

Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to nolast term.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series

and late occupant of the bed?



<P>Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker),

commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal

proportion and commercial ability?



<P>Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members

of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted first

with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue,

with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?



<P>Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Envy?



<P>Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent

posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder

movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not

acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive

but not obtuse.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Jealousy?



<P>Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately

the agent and reagent of attraction. Because action between agents and

reagents at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and

decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because

the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced,

if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Abnegation?



<P>In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment

of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality

extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person,

c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual

altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition,

supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common

current expenses, net proceeds divided.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Equanimity?



<P>As natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood

executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his,

her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not as calamitous

as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of collision

with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty

to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery,

embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust,

malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt

of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary,

jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in

the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king's enemies,

impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated

murder. As not more abnormal than all other altered processes of adaptation

to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium

between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages,

acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease. As more than

inevitable, irreparable.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?



<P>From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but

outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially

violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously

violated.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What retribution, if any?



<P>Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by

combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic

bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witness), not yet. Suit

for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of

injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. If any, positively,

connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency

of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation,

alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the

other, protecting separator from both.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void incertitude,

justify to himself his sentiments?



<P>The preordained frangibility of the hymen, the presupposed intangibility

of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging

tension of the thing proposed to be done and the self abbreviating relaxation

of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female, the

muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical

transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite

proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatop<oe>ic transitive

verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative

aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb

and quasimonosyllabic onomatop<oe>ic past participle with complementary

masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators

by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility

of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the

lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections,

reduced to their simplest forms, converge?



<P>Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres,

in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of

the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the

land of promise) of adipose posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk

and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of

secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression

or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature

animality.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>The visible signs of antesatisfaction?



<P>An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation:

a tentative revelation; a silent contemplation.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Then?



<P>He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each

plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure

prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>The visible signs of postsatisfaction?



<P>A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a

solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What followed this silent action?



<P>Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,

catechetical interrogation.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?



<P>Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between

Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in

the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited,

8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response

thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown.

Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandman Palmer of

Leah at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, an invitation

to supper at Wynn's (Murphy's) Hotel, 35, 36, and 37 Lower Abbey street,

a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entitled <I>Sweets of Sin</I>,

anonymous, author a gentleman of fashion, a temporary concussion caused

by a falsely calculated movement in the course of postcenal gymnastic display,

the victim (since completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor

and author, eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation,

an aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness,

the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic

flexibility.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?



<P>Absolutely.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?



<P>Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were

perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course

of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?



<P>By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been

celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8

September 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with

female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated

on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with

ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken

place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29 December

1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894, aged 11

days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during

which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen

within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation of activity,

mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself

and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty,

indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and

listener, 15 September 1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1

day during which in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension

in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue),

complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>How?



<P>By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine

destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for

which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected

or effected.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>What moved visibly above the listener's and the narrator's invisible

thoughts?



<P>The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric

circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>In what directions did listener and narrator lie?



<P>Listener, S. E. by E.; Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of

latitude, N. and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45&oslash;

to the terrestrial equator.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>In what state of rest or motion?



<P>At rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being

each and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the

proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging

space.



<P>In what posture?



<P>Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right

leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the

attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator:

reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the indexfinger

and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in the attitude

depicted on a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the childman weary,

the manchild in the womb.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>Womb? Weary?



<P>He rests. He has travelled.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>With?



<P>Sinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and Whinbad

the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and Binbad the Bailer

and Pinbad the Pailer and Minbad the Mailer and Hinbad the Hailer and Rinbad

the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and Vinbad the Quailer and Linbad the

Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer.



<P>

<HR width="50%">



<P>When?



<P>Going to a dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc's

auk's egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of Darkinbad

the Brightdayler.



<P>

Scylla and Charybdis</H1></CENTER>

URBANE, TO COMFORT THEM, THE QUAKER LIBRARIAN PURRED:



<P>-- And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of <I>Wilhelm Meister?</I>

A great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms against

a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.



<P>He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step

backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.



<P>A noiseless attendant, setting open the door but slightly, made him

a noiseless beck.



<P>-- Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautiful

ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always feels

that Goethe's judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.



<P>Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door

he gave his large ear all to the attendant's words: heard them: and was

gone.



<P>Two left.



<P>-- Monsieur de la Palisse, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes

before his death.



<P>-- Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with

elder's gall, to write <I>Paradise Lost</I> at your dictation? <I>The Sorrows

of Satan</I> he calls it.



<P>Smile. Smile Cranly's smile.

<BLOCKQUOTE>First he tickled her

<BR>Then he patted her

<BR>Then he passed the female catheter.

<BR>For he was a medical

<BR>jolly old medi.</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- I feel you would need one more for <I>Hamlet</I>. Seven is dear to the

mystic mind. The shining seven W. B. calls them.



<P>Glittereyed, his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought

the face, bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He laughed

low: a sizar's laugh of Trinity: unanswered.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood

<BR>Tears such as angels weep.

<BR>Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta.</BLOCKQUOTE>

He holds my follies hostage.



<P>Cranly's eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland. Gaptoothed Kathleen,

her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house. And one more

to hail him: <I>ave, rabbi</I>. The Tinahely twelve. In the shadow of the

glen he cooees for them. My soul's youth I gave him, night by night. Godspeed.

Good hunting.



<P>Mulligan has my telegram.



<P>Folly. Persist.



<P>-- Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create

a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare's Hamlet though

I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.



<P>-- All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his

shadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex. Clergymen's

discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal to us ideas,

formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a work of art is

out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of Gustave Moreau is

the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words of Hamlet

bring our mind into contact with the eternal wisdom, Plato's world of ideas.

All the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys.



<P>A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike

me!



<P>-- The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.

Aristotle was once Plato's schoolboy.



<P>-- And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said.

One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.



<P>He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.



<P>Formless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, the heavenly

man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who suffers in

us at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon the altar.

I am the sacrificial butter.



<P>Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A. E., Arval, the Name

Ineffable, in heaven hight, K. H., their master, whose identity is no secret

to adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching to see if

they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of light, born

of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the plane of buddhi.

The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O. P. must work off bad karma

first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very illustrious sister H. P.

B's elemental.



<P>O, fie! Out on't! <I>Pfuiteufel!</I> You naughtn't to look, missus,

so you naughtn't when a lady's ashowing of her elemental.



<P>Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with

grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.



<P>-- That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet's musings about

the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic

monologue, as shallow as Plato's.



<P>John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:



<P>-- Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle

with Plato.



<P>-- Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his

commonwealth?



<P>Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of allhorse.

Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the street: very

peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through spaces smaller

than red globules of man's blood they creepycrawl after Blake's buttocks

into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow. Hold to the

now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.



<P>Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.



<P>-- Haines is gone, he said.



<P>-- Is he?



<P>-- I was showing him Jubainville's book. He's quite enthusiastic, don't

you know, about Hyde's <I>Lovesongs of Connacht</I>. I couldn't bring him

in to hear the discussion. He's gone to Gill's to buy it.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick

<BR>To greet the callous public.

<BR>Writ, I ween, 'twas not my wish

<BR>In lean unlovely English.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.



<P>We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green

twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.



<P>-- People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg

of Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the

world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant's heart on the

hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living

mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling

novel, the musichall song, France produces the finest flower of corruption

in Mallarm&eacute; but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor

of heart, the life of Homer's Ph&amp;Aelig;acians.



<P>From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.



<P>-- Mallarm&eacute;, don't you know, he said, has written those wonderful

prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about

<I>Hamlet</I>. He says: <I>il se prom&egrave;ne, lisant au livre de lui-m&ecirc;me</I>,

don't you know, <I>reading the book of himself</I>. He describes <I>Hamlet</I>

given in a French town, don't you know, a provincial town. They advertised

it.



<P>His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.

<BLOCKQUOTE>HAMLET

<BR>ou

<BR>LE DISTRAIT

<BR>Pi&egrave;ce de Shakespeare</BLOCKQUOTE>

He repeated to John Eglinton's newgathered frown:



<P>-- <I>Pi&eacute;ce de Shakespeare</I>, don't you know. It's so French,

the French point of view. <I>Hamlet ou</I>...



<P>-- The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.



<P>John Eglinton laughed.



<P>-- Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt,

but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.



<P>Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.



<P>-- A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not

for nothing was he a butcher's son wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting

in his palm. Nine lives are taken off for his father's one, Our Father

who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don't hesitate to shoot. The bloodboltered

shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by Mr

Swinburne.



<P>Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none

<BR>But we had spared...</BLOCKQUOTE>

Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.



<P>-- He will have it that <I>Hamlet</I> is a ghoststory, John Eglinton

said for Mr Best's behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make

our flesh creep.

<BLOCKQUOTE>List! List! O List!</BLOCKQUOTE>

My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.

<BLOCKQUOTE>If thou didst ever...</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded

into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners.

Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from

virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from <I>limbo patrum</I>, returning to

the world that has forgotten him? Who is king Hamlet?



<P>John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge:



<P>Lifted.



<P>-- It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with

a swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside.

The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden. Canvasclimbers

who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings.



<P>Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.



<P>-- Shakespeare has left the huguenot's house in Silver street and walks

by the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the pen

chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon has other

thoughts.



<P>Composition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!



<P>-- The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the

castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the

ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who

has studied <I>Hamlet</I> all the years of his life which were not vanity

in order to play the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to Burbage,

the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling

him by a name:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Hamlet, I am thy father's spirit</BLOCKQUOTE>

bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince,

young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died

in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.



<P>-- Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence,

and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own

words to his own son's name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have

been prince Hamlet's twin) is it possible, I want to know, or probable

that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:

you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is

the guilty queen. Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?



<P>-- But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began

impatiently.



<P>Art thou there, truepenny?



<P>-- Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays.

I mean when we read the poetry of <I>King Lear</I> what is it to us how

the poet lived? As for living, our servants can do that for us, Villiers

de l'Isle has said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day,

the poet's drinking, the poet's debts. We have <I>King Lear</I>: and it

is immortal.



<P>Mr Best's face appealed to, agreed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Flow over them with your waves and with your waters,

<BR>Mananaan, Mananaan MacLir...</BLOCKQUOTE>

How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?



<P>Marry, I wanted it.



<P>Take thou this noble.



<P>Go to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson's bed, clergyman's daughter.

Agenbite of inwit.



<P>Do you intend to pay it back?



<P>O, yes.



<P>When? Now?



<P>Well... no.



<P>When, then?



<P>I paid my way. I paid my way.



<P>Steady on. He's from beyant Boyne water. The northeast corner. You owe

it.



<P>Wait. Five months. Molecules all change. I am other I now. Other I got

pound.



<P>Buzz. Buzz.



<P>But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under everchanging

forms.



<P>I that sinned and prayed and fasted.



<P>A child Conmee saved from pandies.



<P>I, I and I. I.



<P>A.E.I.O.U.



<P>-- Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries?

John Eglinton's carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid for

ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.



<P>-- She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.

She saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She

bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids

closed when he lay on his deathbed.



<P>Mother's deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into this

world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. <I>Liliata rutilantium</I>.



<P>I wept alone.



<P>John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.



<P>-- The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and

got out of it as quickly and as best he could.



<P>-- Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His

errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.



<P>Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted,

bald, eared and assiduous.



<P>-- A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery,

one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?



<P>-- Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts

into the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (<I>absit nomen!</I>)

Socratididion's Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know. But

neither the midwife's lore nor the caudlectures saved him from the archons

of Sinn Fein and their noggin of hemlock.



<P>-- But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best's quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we

seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.



<P>His look went from brooder's beard to carper's skull, to remind, to

chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless

though maligned.



<P>-- He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.

He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling

<I>The girl I left behind me</I>. If the earthquake did not time it we

should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds,

the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, <I>Venus and Adonis</I>,

lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London. Is Katharine the

shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and beautiful. Do you think

the writer of <I>Antony and Cleopatra</I>, a passionate pilgrim, had his

eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire

to lie withal? Good: he left her and gained the world of men. But his boywomen

are the women of a boy. Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males.

He chose badly? He was chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will

Ann hath a way. By cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him,

sweet and twentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis,

stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford

wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.



<P>And my turn? When?



<P>Come!



<P>-- Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly

brightly.



<P>He murmured then with blonde delight for all:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Between the acres of the rye

<BR>These pretty countryfolk would lie.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.



<P>A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its

cooperative watch.



<P>-- I am afraid I am due at the <I>Homestead</I>.



<P>Whither away? Exploitable ground.



<P>-- Are you going, John Eglinton's active eyebrows asked. Shall we see

you at Moore's tonight? Piper is coming.



<P>-- Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?



<P>Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.



<P>-- I don't know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get

away in time.



<P>Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. <I>Isis Unveiled</I>. Their Pali book

we tried to pawn. Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an

Aztec logos, functioning on astral levels, their oversoul, mahamahatma.

The faithful hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship, ringroundabout

him. Louis H. Victory. T. Caulfield Irwin. Lotus ladies tend them i'the

eyes, their pineal glands aglow. Filled with his god he thrones, Buddh

under plantain. Gulfer of souls, engulfer. Hesouls, shesouls, shoals of

souls. Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled, whirling, they bewail.

<BLOCKQUOTE>In quintessential triviality

<BR>For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt.</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said,

friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together

a sheaf of our younger poets' verses. We are all looking forward anxiously.



<P>Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted,

shone.



<P>See this. Remember.



<P>Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his ashplanthandle

over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly with two index fingers.

Aristotle's experiment. One or two? Necessity is that in virtue of which

it is impossible that one can be otherwise. Argai, one hat is one hat.



<P>Listen.



<P>Young Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part.

Longworth will give it a good puff in the <I>Express</I>. O, will he? I

liked Colum's <I>Drover</I>. Yes, I think he has that queer thing, genius.

Do you think he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: <I>As in wild

earth a Grecian vase</I>. Did he? I hope you'll be able to come tonight.

Malachi Mulligan is coming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did you

hear Miss Mitchell's joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is Martyn's

wild oats? Awfully clever, isn't it? They remind one of don Quixote and

Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says.

Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin.

With a saffron kilt? O'Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the grand old

tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever sketches.

We are becoming important, it seems.



<P>Cordelia. <I>Cordoglio</I>. Lir's loneliest daughter.



<P>Nookshotten. Now your best French polish.



<P>-- Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If you will

be so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...



<P>-- O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so much

correspondence.



<P>-- I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.



<P>Good ild you. The pigs' paper. Bullockbefriending.



<P>-- Synge has promised me an article for <I>Dana</I> too. Are we going

to be read? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish.

I hope you will come round tonight. Bring Starkey.



<P>Stephen sat down.



<P>The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing his mask said:



<P>-- Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.



<P>He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of

a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:



<P>-- Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?



<P>Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?



<P>-- Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been

first a sundering.



<P>-- Yes.



<P>Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks

from hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Women

he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully

tapsters' wives. Fox and geese. And in New Place a slack dishonoured body

that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves

falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.



<P>-- Yes. So you think.



<P>The door closed behind the outgoer.



<P>Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and

brooding air.



<P>A vestal's lamp.



<P>Here he ponders things that were not: what Caesar would have lived to

do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities

of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore

when he lived among women.



<P>Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.

Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the voice

of that Egyptian highpriest. <I>In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks</I>.



<P>They are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch

of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak

their will.



<P>-- Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic.

We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so much. Others

abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.



<P>-- But <I>Hamlet</I> is so personal, isn't it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean,

a kind of private paper, don't you know, of his private life. I mean I

don't care a button, don't you know, who is killed or who is guilty...



<P>He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his defiance.

His private papers in the original. <I>Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim imo shagart</I>.

Put beurla on it, littlejohn.



<P>Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:



<P>-- I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but

I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare

is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.



<P>Bear with me.



<P>Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes, glinting stern under wrinkled

brows. A basilisk. <I>E quando vede l'uomo l'attosca</I>. Messer Brunetto,

I thank thee for the word.



<P>-- As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,

from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist

weave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is where

it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff

time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of

the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination, when

the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which

I am and that which in possibility I may come to be. So in the future,

the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection

from that which then I shall be.



<P>Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.



<P>-- Yes, Mr Best said youngly, I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness

might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from

the son.



<P>Has the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.



<P>-- That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.



<P>John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.



<P>-- If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a

drug in the market. The plays of Shakespeare's later years which Renan

admired so much breathe another spirit.



<P>-- The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.



<P>-- There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been

a sundering.



<P>Said that.



<P>-- If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over

the hell of time of <I>King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida</I>,

look to see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a

man, Shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles,

prince of Tyre?



<P>Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.



<P>-- A child, a girl placed in his arms, Marina.



<P>-- The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant

quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead

to the town.



<P>Good Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon's wild oats. Cypherjugglers

going the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. What town good masters?

Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the sun, west

of the moon: <I>Tir na n-og</I>. Booted the twain and staved.

<BLOCKQUOTE>How many miles to Dublin?

<BR>Three score and ten, sir.

<BR>Will we be there by candlelight?</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing

period.



<P>-- Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus, as some aver

his name is, say of it?



<P>-- Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,

that which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter's

child. <I>My dearest wife</I>, Pericles says, <I>was like this maid</I>.

Will any man love the daughter it he has not loved the mother?



<P>-- The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. <I>L'art d'&ecirc;tre

grand</I>...



<P>-- His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard

of all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The

images of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them

grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or repeat himself.



<P>The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.



<P>-- I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment

of the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George

Bernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles on Shakespeare

in the <I>Saturday Review</I> were surely brilliant. Oddly enough he too

draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets. The

favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own that if the

poet must be rejected, such a rejection would seem more in harmony with

- what shall I say? - our notions of what ought not to have been.



<P>Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk's egg, prize

of their fray.



<P>He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost

love thy man?



<P>-- That may be too, Stephen said. There is a saying of Goethe's which

Mr Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you

will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a <I>buonaroba</I>,

a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood,

a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had made

himself a coistrel gentleman and had written <I>Romeo and Juliet</I>. Why?

Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He was overborne in a cornfield

first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own

eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down. Assumed

dongiovannism will not save him. No later undoing will undo the first undoing.

The tusk of the boar has wounded him there-where love lies ableeding. If

the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman's invisible weapon.

There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into

a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding

of himself. A life fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.



<P>They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.



<P>-- The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the

porch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot

know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with

that knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast with two

backs that urged it king Hamlet's ghost could not know of were he not endowed

with knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech (his lean unlovely

English) is always turned elsewhere, backward. Ravisher and ravished, what

he would but would not, go with him from Lucrece's bluecircled ivory globes

to Imogen's breast, bare, with its mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary

of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking

an old sore. But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity

in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by

the laws he has revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now,

the wind by Elsinore's rocks or what you will, the sea's voice, a voice

heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the

son consubstantial with the father.



<P>-- Amen! responded from the doorway.



<P>Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?



<P><I>Entr'acte</I>.



<P>A ribald face, sullen as a dean's, Buck Mulligan came forwards then

blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.



<P>-- You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he

asked of Stephen.



<P>Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.



<P>They make him welcome. <I>Was Din verlachst wirst Du noch dienen</I>.



<P>Brodd of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.



<P>He Who Himself begot, middler the Holy Ghost, and Himself sent himself,

Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped

and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who

let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these

nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet

shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick

shall be dead already.

<BLOCKQUOTE>He lifts hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with

bells aquiring.</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion,

Mr Mulligan, I'll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare.

All sides of life should be represented.



<P>He smiled on all sides equally.



<P>Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:



<P>-- Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.



<P>A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.



<P>-- To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like

Synge.



<P>Mr Best turned to him:



<P>-- Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He'll see you after

at the D. B. C. He's gone to Gill's to buy Hyde's <I>Lovesongs of Connacht</I>.



<P>-- I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?



<P>-- The bard's fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired

perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played

Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining held

that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman?

Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He swears (His Highness

not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.



<P>-- The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde's, Mr Best said,

lifting his brilliant notebook. That <I>Portrait of Mr W. H</I>. where

he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.



<P>-- For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.



<P>Or Hughie Wills. Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?



<P>-- I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.

Of course it's all paradox, don't you know, Hughes and hews and hues the

colour, but it's so typical the way he works it out. It's the very essence

of Wilde, don't you know. The light touch.



<P>His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.

Tame essence of Wilde.



<P>You're darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy's

ducats.



<P>How much did I spend? O, a few shillings.



<P>For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.



<P>Wit. You would give your five wits for youth's proud livery he pranks

in. Lineaments of gratified desire.



<P>There be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool ruttime

send them. Yea, turtledove her.



<P>Eve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in's kiss.



<P>-- Do you think it is only a paradox, the quaker librarian was asking.

The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.



<P>They talked seriously of mocker's seriousness.



<P>Buck Mulligan's again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head

wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His mobile

lips read, smiling with new delight.



<P>-- Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!



<P>He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:



<P>-- <I>The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the

immense debtorship for a thing done</I>. Signed: Dedalus. Where did you

launch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four quid?

The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram! Malachi

Mulligan, the Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, you

priestified kinchite!



<P>Joyfully he thrust the message and envelope into a pocket but keened

in querulous brogue:



<P>-- It's what I'm telling you, mister honey, it's queer and sick we were,

Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. 'Twas murmur we did

for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I'm thinking, and he limp with

leching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery's sitting

civil waiting for pints apiece.



<P>He wailed!



<P>-- And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us

your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like

the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.



<P>Stephen laughed. Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down:



<P>-- The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He

heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He's out in pampooties to

murder you.



<P>-- Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.



<P>Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping

ceiling.



<P>-- Murder you! he laughed.



<P>Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of

lights in rue Saint-Andr&eacute;-des-Arts. In words of words for words,

palabras. Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing

a winebottle, <I>C'est vendredi saint!</I> Murthering Irish. His image,

wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i' the forest.



<P>-- Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.



<P>-- ... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his

<I>Diary of Master William Silence</I> has found the hunting terms... Yes?

What is it?



<P>-- There's a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward

and offering a card. From the <I>Freeman</I>. He wants to see the files

of the <I>Kilkenny People</I> for last year.



<P>-- Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...



<P>He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down, unglanced, looked,

asked, creaked, asked:



<P>-- Is he?... O there!



<P>Brisk in a galliard he was off and out. In the daylit corridor he talked

with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest

broadbrim.



<P>-- This gentleman? <I>Freeman's Journal? Kilkenny People?</I> To be

sure. Good day, sir. <I>Kilkenny</I>... We have certainly...



<P>A patient silhouette waited, listening.



<P>-- All the leading provincial... <I>Northern Whig, Cork Examiner Enniscorthy

Guardian</I>, 1903... Will you please?... Evans, conduct this gentleman...

If you just follow the atten... Or please allow me... This way... Please,

sir...



<P>Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing

dark figure following his hasty heels.



<P>The door closed.



<P>-- The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.



<P>He jumped up and snatched the card.



<P>-- What's his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.



<P>He rattled on.



<P>-- Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the

museum when I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that

has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her. <I>Life

of life, thy lips enkindle</I>.



<P>Suddenly he turned to Stephen:



<P>-- He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker

than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove. Venus

Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! <I>The god pursuing the maiden

hid</I>.



<P>We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best's approval.

We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if

at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.



<P>-- Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty

from Kyrios Menelaus' brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in

whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty years

he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal

to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His art,

more than the art of feudalism, as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of

surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses,

marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when

they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair

of fancy stays. The gombeen woman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to

vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied there between conjugal love

and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures. You

know Manningham's story of the burgher's wife who bade Dick Burbage to

her bed after she had seen him in <I>Richard III</I> and how Shakespeare,

overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns

and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon's

blankets: <I>William the conqueror came before Richard III</I>. And the

gay lakin, Mistress Fitten, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies,

Lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the

punks of the bankside, a penny a time.



<P>Cours-la-Reine. <I>Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites cochonneries.

Minette? Tu veux?</I>



<P>-- The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of Oxford's

mother with her cup of canary for every cockcanary.



<P>Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:



<P>-- Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!



<P>-- And Harry of six wives' daughter and other lady friends from neighbour

seats, as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those twenty years

what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond

panes?



<P>Do and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter Lane of Gerard, herbalist,

he walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of Juno's

eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do. Afar, in

a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.



<P>Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton's desk sharply.



<P>-- Whom do you suspect? he challenged.



<P>-- Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice

spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.



<P>Love that dare not speak its name.



<P>-- As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved

a lord.



<P>Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.



<P>-- It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all

other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the

stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a

shrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two

deeds are rank in that ghost's mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel

on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband's brother. Sweet Ann

I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer twice a wooer.



<P>Stephen turned boldly in his chair.



<P>-- The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said, frowning. If

you deny that in the fifth scene of <I>Hamlet</I> he has branded her with

infamy, tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years

between the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those women

saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor



<P>dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first

to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan,

her husband too, while Susan's daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy's

words, wed her second, having killed her first.



<P>O yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in royal

London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father's

shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended

her to posterity.



<P>He faced their silence.



<P>To whom thus Eglinton:

<BLOCKQUOTE>You mean the will.

<BR>That has been explained, I believe, by jurists.

<BR>She was entitled to her widow's dower

<BR>At common law. His legal knowledge was great

<BR>Our judges tell us.

<BR>Him Satan fleers,



<P>Mocker:



<P>And therefore he left out her name

<BR>From the first draft but he did not leave out

<BR>The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,

<BR>For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford

<BR>And in London. And therefore when he was urged,

<BR>As I believe, to name her

Woa!



<P>-- Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed,

as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.



<P>-- He was a rich countrygentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms

and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist

shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her his

best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?



<P>-- It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr

Secondbest Best said finely.



<P>-- <I>Separatio a mensa et a thalamo</I>, bettered Buck Mulligan and

was smiled on.



<P>-- Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.

Let me think.



<P>-- Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,

Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays

tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his

dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don't forget

Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.



<P>-- Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean...



<P>-- He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish

for a king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!



<P>-- What? asked Besteglinton.



<P>William Shakespeare and company, limited. The people's William. For

terms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house...



<P>-- Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought

of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his hands

and said: <I>All we can say is that life ran very high in those days</I>.

Lovely!



<P>Catamite.



<P>-- The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best

to ugling Eglinton.



<P>Steadfast John replied severe:



<P>-- The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You can not eat your

cake and have it.



<P>Sayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me the palm of beauty?



<P>-- And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his

own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself

a cornjobber and moneylender with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine

riots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by

Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. He sued a fellowplayer

for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest

for every money lent. How else could Aubrey's ostler and callboy get rich

quick? All events brought grist to his mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting

that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen's leech Lopez, his

jew's heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: <I>Hamlet</I>

and <I>Macbeth</I> with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster

with a turn for witchroasting. The lost armada is his jeer in <I>Love's

Labour Lost</I>. His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide

of Mafeking enthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter's

theory of equivocation. The <I>Sea Venture</I> comes home from Bermudas

and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American

cousin. The sugared sonnets follow Sidney's. As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise

carroty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired <I>The Merry Wives of Windsor</I>,

let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings

in the depth of the buckbasket.



<P>I think you're getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological.

<I>Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere</I>.



<P>-- Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly. Your dean

of studies holds he was a holy Roman.



<P><I>Sufflaminandus sum</I>.



<P>-- He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher

of Italian scandals.



<P>-- A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him myriadminded.



<P><I>Amplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia

inter multos</I>.



<P>-- Saint Thomas, Stephen began...



<P>-- <I>Ora pro nobis</I>, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.



<P>There he keened a wailing rune.



<P>-- <I>Pogue mahone! Asushla machree!</I> It's destroyed we are from

this day! It's destroyed we are surely!



<P>All smiled their smiles.



<P>-- Saint Thomas, Stephen, smiling, said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy

reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different

from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his

wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that the love

so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger

who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with avarice,

are of all races the most given to inter-marriage. Accusations are made

in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for

whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too

with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will

tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls

his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what

he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife. No sir smile neighbour

shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or

his jackass.



<P>-- Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.



<P>-- Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.



<P>-- Which Will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.



<P>-- The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will's

widow, is the will to die.



<P>-- <I>Requiescat!</I> Stephen prayed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>What of all the will to do?

<BR>It has vanished long ago...</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobled

queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a

motor car is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes.

In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed at New Place and drank

a quart of sack the town paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not

to ask) and heard she had a soul. She read or had read to her his chapbooks

preferring them to the <I>Merry Wives</I> and, loosing her nightly waters

on the jordan, she thought over <I>Hooks and Eyes for Believers' Breeches</I>

and <I>The most Spiritual Snuffbox</I> <I>to Make the Most Devout Souls

Sneeze</I>. Venus had twisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse

of conscience. It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.



<P>-- History shows that to be true, <I>inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos</I>.

The ages succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man's

worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that Russell

is right. What do we care for his wife and father? I should say that only

family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man. I feel that

the fat knight is his supreme creation.



<P>Lean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy supping

with the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it

him. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there's a gentleman

to see you. Me? Says he's your father, sir. Give me my Wordsworth. Enter

Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with a buttoned

codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten forests, a wand

of wilding in his hand.



<P>Your own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.



<P>Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I touched

his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is attending her.

The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.



<P>-- A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary

evil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father's death.

If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with

thirtyfive years of life, <I>nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita</I>, with

fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then

you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No.

The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night. From hour to hour

it rots and rots. He rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that

mystical estate upon his son. Boccaccio's Calandrino was the first and

last man who felt himself with child. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious

begetting, is unknown to man. It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession,

from only begetter to only begotten. On that mystery and not on the madonna

which the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church

is founded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro-

and microcosm, upon the void. Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood. <I>Amor

matris</I>, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true thing

in life. Paternity may be a legal fiction. Who is the father of any son

that any son should love him or he any son?



<P>What the hell are you driving at?



<P>I know. Shut up. Blast you! I have reasons.



<P><I>Amplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea</I>.



<P>Are you condemned to do this?



<P>-- They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal

annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities, hardly

record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbic sisters,

loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers, jailbirds

with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The sun unborn mars beauty: born,

he brings pain, divides affection, increases care. He is a male: his growth

is his father's decline, his youth his father's envy, his friend his father's

enemy.



<P>In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.



<P>-- What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut. Am I father?

If I were?



<P>Shrunken uncertain hand.



<P>-- Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of

the field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of

Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if the

father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father

be a son? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the

same name in the comedy of errors wrote <I>Hamlet</I> he was not the father

of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself

the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father

of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was born for nature,

as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.



<P>Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladly glancing,

a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.



<P>Flatter. Rarely. But Flatter.



<P>-- Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big

with child. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play!

The play's the thing! Let me parturiate!



<P>He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.



<P>-- As for his family, Stephen said, his mother's name lives in the forest

of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in <I>Coriolanus</I>.

His boyson's death is the deathscene of young Arthur in <I>King John</I>.

Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the girls in <I>The

Tempest</I>, in <I>Pericles</I>, in <I>Winter's Tale</I> are we know. Who

Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may guess. But

there is another member of his family who is recorded.



<P>-- The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.



<P>The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with

haste, quake, quack.



<P>Door closed. Cell. Day.



<P>They list. Three. They.



<P>I you he they.



<P>Come, mess.

<BLOCKQUOTE>STEPHEN He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert

in his old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister

Gatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the playwriter

up in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on's back. The playhouse sausage

filled Gilbert's soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund and a Richard are recorded

in the works of sweet William.



<P>MAGEEGLINJOHN Names! What's in a name?



<P>BEST That is my name, Richard, don't you know. I hope you are going

STEPHEN In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago, Richard

Nay, that last play was written or being written while his brother Edmund

<P>BEST I hope Edmund is going to catch it. I don't want Richard, my name.

<CENTER>(<I>Laughter</I>.)</CENTER>





<P>QUAKERLYSTER (<I>A tempo</I>.) But he that filches from me my good name...



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Stringendo</I>.) He has hidden his own name, a fair name,

William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old

Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it in

the sonnets where there is Will in overplus. Like John O'Gaunt his name

is dear to him, as dear as the coat of arms he toadied for, on a bend sable

a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer than his

glory of greatest shakescene in the country. What's in a name? That is

what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told

is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake rose at his birth. It shone by

day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in the night, and by night

it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is

the signature of his initial among the stars. His eyes watched it, lowlying

on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer

fields at midnight, returning from Shottery and from her arms.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Both satisfied. I too.



<P>Don't tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.



<P>And from her arms.



<P>Wait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?



<P>Read the skies. <I>Autontimerumenos. Bonus Stephanoumenos</I>. Where's

your configuration? Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. S. D.: <I>sua

donna. Gi&agrave;: di lui. Gelindo risolve di non amar. S. D.</I>



<P>-- What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a celestial

phenomenon?



<P>-- A star by night, Stephen said, a pillar of the cloud by day.



<P>What more's to speak?



<P>Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.



<P><I>Stephanos</I>, my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape

of my feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.



<P>-- You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own name

is strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.



<P>Me, Magee and Mulligan.



<P>Fabulous artificer, the hawklike man. You flew. Whereto? Newhaven-Dieppe,

steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus. <I>Pater, ait</I>.

Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing he.



<P>Mr Best's eagerquietly lifted his book to say:



<P>-- That's very interesting because that brother motive, don't you know,

we find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three brothers

Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don't you know, the fairytales. The third brother

that marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize.



<P>Best of Best brothers. Good, better, best.



<P>The quaker librarian springhalted near.



<P>-- I should like to know, he said, which brother you... I understand

you to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers... But perhaps

I am anticipating?



<P>He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.



<P>An attendant from the doorway called:



<P>-- Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...



<P>-- O! Father Dineen! Directly.



<P>Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.



<P>John Eglinton touched the foil.



<P>-- Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.

You kept them for the last, didn't you?



<P>-- In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and

nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A

brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.



<P>Lapwing.



<P>Where is your brother? Apothecaries' hall. My whetstone. Him, then Cranly,

Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They mock to

try you. Act. Be acted on.



<P>Lapwing.



<P>I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.



<P>On.



<P>-- You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which

he took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others?

Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann

(what's in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard

the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The other

four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his kings Richard

is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare's reverence, the angel of the

world. Why is the underplot of <I>King Lear</I> in which Edmund figures

lifted out of Sidney's <I>Arcadia</I> and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend

older than history?



<P>-- That was Will's way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine

a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. <I>Que voulez-vous?</I>

Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote

Aristotle.



<P>-- Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or

the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare,

what the poor is not, always with him. The note of banishment, banishment

from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from <I>The

Two Gentlemen of Verona</I> onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries

it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book. It doubles itself

in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself,

protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe. It repeats itself again when

he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old

block, is accused of adultery. But it was the original sin that darkened

his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination

to evil. The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth: an original

sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has

sinned. It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified

on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has

not withered it. Beauty and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite

variety everywhere in the world he has created, in <I>Much Ado about Nothing</I>,

twice in <I>As you like It</I>, in <I>The Tempest</I>, in <I>Hamlet</I>,

in <I>Measure for Measure</I>, and in all the other plays which I have

not read.



<P>He laughed to free his mind from his mind's bondage. Judge Eglinton

summed up.



<P>-- The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince.

He is all in all.



<P>-- He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act

five. All in all. In <I>Cymbeline</I>, in <I>Othello</I> he is bawd and

cuckold. He acts and is acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like

Jos&eacute; he kills the real Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the

hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.



<P>-- Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!



<P>Dark dome received, reverbed.



<P>-- And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.

When all is said Dumas <I>fils</I> (or is it Dumas <I>p&egrave;re</I>?)

is right. After God Shakespeare has created most.



<P>-- Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns

after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where

he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey

of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The

motion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet <I>p&eacute;re</I> and Hamlet

<I>fils</I>. A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music.

And, what though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts

for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom

they refuse to be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous

Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa's lump of love, and nuncle

Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the

bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world without as actual

what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck says: <I>If Socrates

leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep. If

Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend</I>. Every life

is many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers,

ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love. But

always meeting ourselves. The playwright who wrote the folio of this world

and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later),

the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call <I>dio

boia</I>, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and

butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven,

foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous

angel, being a wife unto himself.



<P>-- <I>Eureka!</I> Buck Mulligan cried. <I>Eureka!</I>



<P>Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton's

desk.



<P>-- May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.



<P>He began to scribble on a slip of paper.



<P>Take some slips from the counter going out.



<P>-- Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one,

shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.



<P>He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.



<P>Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his

variorum edition of <I>The Taming of the Shrew</I>.



<P>-- You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have

brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe your

own theory?



<P>-- No, Stephen said promptly.



<P>-- Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a

dialogue, don't you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.



<P>John Eclecticon doubly smiled.



<P>-- Well, in that case, he said, I don't see why you should expect payment

for it since you don't believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is some

mystery in <I>Hamlet</I> but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man

Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that

the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to visit the

present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the

plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he believes his theory.



<P>I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or

help me to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? <I>Egomen</I>. Who to unbelieve?

Other chap.



<P>-- You are the only contributor to <I>Dana</I> who asks for pieces of

silver. Then I don't know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space

for an article on economics.



<P>Fraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.



<P>-- For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.



<P>Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then

gravely said, honeying malice:



<P>-- I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh

street and found him deep in the study of the <I>Summa contra Gentiles</I>

in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay

whore.



<P>He broke away.



<P>-- Come, Kinch. Come, wandering &amp;Aelig;ngus of the birds.



<P>Come, Kinch, you have eaten all we left. Ay, I will serve you your orts

and offals.



<P>Stephen rose.



<P>Life is many days. This will end.



<P>-- We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. <I>Notre ami</I> Moore

says Malachi Mulligan must be there.



<P>Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.



<P>-- Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth

of Ireland. I'll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk

straight?



<P>Laughing he...



<P>Swill till eleven. Irish nights' entertainment.



<P>Lubber...



<P>Stephen followed a lubber...



<P>One day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After his

lub back I followed. I gall his kibe.



<P>Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt

head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of

no thoughts.



<P>What have I learned? Of them? Of me?



<P>Walk like Haines now.



<P>The constant readers' room. In the readers' book Cashe Boyle O'Connor

Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was Hamlet

mad? The quaker's pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.



<P>-- O please do, sir... I shall be most pleased...



<P>Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:



<P>-- A pleased bottom.



<P>The turnstile.



<P>Is that?... Blueribboned hat... Idly writing... What? Looked?...



<P>The curving balustrade; smoothsliding Mincius.



<P>Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:

<BLOCKQUOTE>John Eglinton, my jo, John.

He sputtered to the air:

Jest on. Know thyself.



<P>Halted below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.



<P>-- Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing

black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are black.



<P>A laugh tripped over his lips.



<P>-- Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that

old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jew jesuit! She gets you

a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus. Couldn't

you do the Yeats touch?



<P>He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:



<P>-- The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.

One thinks of Homer.



<P>He stopped at the stairfoot.



<P>-- I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.



<P>The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men's morrice

<P>In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Everyman His own Wife

<BR>or

<BR>(a national immorality in three orgasms)

<BR>by

<BR>Ballocky Mulligan</BLOCKQUOTE>

He turned a happy patch's smirk to Stephen, saying:



<P>-- The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.



<P>He read, <I>marcato</I>:



<P>-- Characters:

<BR>FRESH NELLY

<BR>and

<BR>ROSALIE (the coalquay whore)</BLOCKQUOTE>

He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:

and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:



<P>-- O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to

lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured,

multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!



<P>-- The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted

them.



<P>About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.



<P>Part. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today,

if Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must

come to, ineluctably.



<P>My will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.



<P>A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.



<P>-- Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.



<P>The portico.



<P>Here I watched the birds for augury. &amp;Aelig;ngus of the birds. They

go, they come. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wandered. Street of

harlots after. A creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.



<P>-- The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown's awe. Did

you see his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I fear thee, ancient

mariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.



<P>Manner of Oxenford.



<P>Day. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.



<P>A dark back went before them. Step of a pard, down, out by the gateway,

under portcullis barbs.



<P>They followed.



<P>Offend me still. Speak on.



<P>Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail

from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw

of softness softly were blown.



<P>Cease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline, hierophantic:

PREPARATORY TO ANYTHING ELSE MR BLOOM BRUSHED OFF THE GREATER bulk of the

shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally

in orthodox Samaritan fashion, which he very badly needed. His (Stephen's)

mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and

on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom, in view of

the hour it was and there being no pumps of Vartry water available for

their ablutions, let alone drinking purposes, hit upon an expedient by

suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman's shelter, as it

was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt Bridge, where they might

hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral.

But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he was rather nonplussed

but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures

on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen

repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face

so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some

description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being

e. d. ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing

to be found. Accordingly, after a few such preliminaries, as, in spite

of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after

it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, brushing, they both walked

together along Beaver street, or, more properly, lane, as far as the farrier's

and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner

of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching

into Amiens Street round by the corner of Dan Bergin's. But, as he confidently

anticipated, there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to

be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on

the spree, outside the North Star Hotel and there was no symptom of its

budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional

whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding

his arms arched over his head, twice.



<P>This was a quandary but, bringing commonsense to bear on it, evidently

there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it

which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullet's and the Signal

House, which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction

of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance

that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured

adage, gone the way of all buttons, though, entering thoroughly into the

spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance. So, as

neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and

the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation

of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle

was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United

Tramways Company's sandstrewer happening to be returning the elder man

recounted to his companion <I>&agrave; propos</I> of the incident his own

truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They passed the main

entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for

Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour, and,

passing the back door of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not

to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night), ultimately gained

the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for

its C division police station. Between this point and the high, at present

unlit, warehouses of Beresford Place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen,

associated with Baird's, the stonecutter's, in his mind somehow in Talbot

Place, first turning on the right, while the other, who was acting as his

<I>fidus Achates</I>, inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James

Rourke's city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very

palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public

the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your

bread, O tell me where is fancy bread? At Rourke's the baker's, it is said.



<P><I>En route</I>, to his taciturn, and, not to put too fine a point on

it, not yet perfectly sober companion, Mr Bloom, who at all events, was

in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly

sober, spoke a word of caution <I>re</I> the dangers of nighttown, women

of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while,

though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap

for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking

habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little juijitsu

for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer

a nasty kick if you didn't look out. Highly providential was the appearance

on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious

that, but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour, the

finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident

ward, or, failing that, the Bridewell and an appearance in the court next

day before Mr Tobias, or, he being the solicitor, rather old Wall, he meant

to say, or Malony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited

about. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen,

whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service

of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A

Division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten

gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the City,

Pembroke Road, for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence,

the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another

thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms

of any description, liable to go off at any time, which was tantamount

to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall nut over

anything. You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and

health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing,

fast women of the <I>demimonde</I> ran away with a lot of #. s. d. into

the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though,

touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of

choice old wine in season as both nourishing and blood-making and possessing

aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer

in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line

as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the

tender mercy of others practically. Most of all he commented adversely

on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting <I>confr&egrave;res</I>

but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos

under all the circs.



<P>-- And that one was Judas, said Stephen, who up to then had said nothing

whatsoever of any kind.



<P>Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back

of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge when a brazier

of coke burning in front of a sentrybox, or something like one, attracted

their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for no

special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light

emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of

the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began to

remember that this had happened, or had been mentioned as having happened,

before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised

in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's Gumley. To avoid a meeting

be drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.



<P>-- Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.



<P>A figure of middle height on the prowl, evidently, under the arches

saluted again, calling: <I>Night!</I> Stephen, of course, started rather

dizzily and stopped to return the compliment. Mr Bloom, actuated by motives

of inherent delicacy, inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own

business, moved off but nevertheless remained on the <I>qui vive</I> with

just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least. Although unusual

in the Dublin area, he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes

who had next to nothing to live on to be about waylaying and generally

terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in

some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames

embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders

ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a

moments notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral,

gagged and garotted.



<P>Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though

he was not in any over sober state himself, recognised Corley's breath

redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley, some called him, and his

genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of Inspector Corley

of the G Division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine

Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His grandfather, Patrick Michael

Corley, of New Ross, had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden

name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had it, though not proved,

that she descended from the house of the Lords Talbot de Malahide in whose

mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth

seeing, his mother or aunt or some relative had enjoyed the distinction

of being in service in the washkitchen. This, therefore, was the reason

why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed

Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John

Corley.



<P>Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.

Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. His friends had

all deserted him. Furthermore, he had a row with Lenehan and called him

to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of other uncalled-for expressions.

He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God's

earth he could get something, anything at all to do. No, it was the daughter

of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the

house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both

occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn't a complete

fabrication from start to finish. Anyhow, he was ill in.



<P>-- I wouldn't ask you, only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows

I'm on the rocks.



<P>-- There'll be a job tomorrow or the next day, Stephen told him, in

a boys' school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garret Deasy. Try it.

You may mention my name.



<P>-- Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn't teach in a school, man.

I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. Got stuck

twice in the junior at the Christian Brothers.



<P>-- I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.



<P>Corley, at the first go-off, was inclined to suspect it was something

to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody

tart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney's,

but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M'Conachie

told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern

street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar

Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he hadn't said a word about

it.



<P>Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it

still Stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew

that Corley's brandnew rigmarole, on a par with the others, was hardly

deserving of much credence. However, <I>haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere

disco</I>, etcetera, as the Latin poet remarks, especially as luck would

have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth

which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of

the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke was nothing would

get it Out of Corley's head that he was living in affluence and hadn't

a thing to do but hand out the needful - whereas. He put his hand in a

pocket anyhow, not with the idea of finding any food there, but thinking

he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour

at all events and get sufficient to eat. But the result was in the negative

for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken biscuits were

all the result of his investigation. He tried his hardest to recollect

for the moment whether he had lost, as well he might have, or left, because

in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse,

in fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search

though he tried to recollect about biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now

exactly gave them, or where was, or did he buy? However, in another pocket

he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously,

however, as it turned out.



<P>-- Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.



<P>And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen lent him one

of them.



<P>-- Thanks, Corley answered. You're a gentleman. I'll pay you back some

time. Who's that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse

in Camden street with Boylan the billsticker. You might put in a good word

for us to get me taken on there. I'd carry a sandwichboard only the girl

in the office told me they're full up for the next three weeks, man. God,

you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don't

give a shite anyway so long as I get a job even as a crossing sweeper.



<P>Subsequently, being not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six

he got, he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky

that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam's, the shipchandler's bookkeeper

there, that used to be often round in Nagle's back with O'Mara and a little

chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow, he was lagged the night

before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to

go with the constable.



<P>Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the

cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman's

sentrybox, who, evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having

a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account

while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at

Stephen's anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen

that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position

to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. Being a levelheaded

individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation,

he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel

generally, testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Probably he was one of

his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one

preying on his next door neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put

it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street

chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude, with or without the

option of a fine, would be a very <I>rara avis</I> altogether. In any case

he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that

hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.



<P>The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom, who, with his

practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the

blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said,

laughingly, Stephen, that is:



<P>-- He's down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named

Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.



<P>At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest,

Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the

direction of a bucket dredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,

moored alongside Customhouse Quay and quite possibly Out of repair, whereupon

he observed evasively:



<P>-- Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention

it his face was familiar to me. But leaving that for the moment, how much

did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?



<P>-- Half-a-crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.



<P>-- Needs, Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at

the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably

does. Everyone according to his needs and everyone according to his deeds.

But talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will

you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is Out of the question and, even

supposing you did, you won't get in after what occurred at Westland Row

station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I don't mean to presume to dictate

to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father's house?



<P>-- To seek misfortune, was Stephen's answer.



<P>-- I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically

returned. Today, in fact, or, to be strictly accurate, on yesterday. Where

does he live at present? I gathered in the course of conversation that

he had moved.



<P>-- I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.

Why?



<P>-- A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects

than one and a born <I>raconteur</I> if ever there was one. He takes great

pride, quite legitimately, Out of you. You could go back, perhaps, he hazarded,

still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when

it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that

English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion,

were patently trying, as if the whole bally station belonged to them, to

give Stephen the slip in the confusion.



<P>There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion, however, such as

it was, Stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his

family hearth the last time he saw it, with his sister, Dilly, sitting

by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell

cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could

drink it with the oatmeal water for milk after the Friday herrings they

had eaten at two a penny, with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey,

the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred

fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the

third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded,

it being quarter tense or, if not, ember days or something like that.



<P>-- No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn't personally repose much trust

in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr

Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher, and friend, if I were in your shoes.

He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability

he never realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you

didn't notice as much as I did but it wouldn't occasion me the least surprise

to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink

for some ulterior object.



<P>He understood, however, from all he heard, that Dr Mulligan was a versatile

allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming

to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy

a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical

practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which

professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial

respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?

was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not

too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what

earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer

cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.



<P>-- Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking

your brains, he ventured to throw out.



<P>The guarded glance of half solicitude, half curiosity, augmented by

friendliness, which he gave at Stephen's at present morose expression of

features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact, on the problem

as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled, to judge by two or

three low spirited remarks he let drop, or, the other way about, saw through

the affair, and, for some reason or other best known to himself, allowed

matters to more or less... Grinding poverty did have that effect and he

more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed,

he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.



<P>Adjacent to the men's public urinal he perceived an icecream car round

which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting

rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly

animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.



<P>-- <I>Putana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!</I>



<P>-- <I>Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano pi&ugrave;</I>



<P>-- <I>Dice lui, pero</I>.



<P>-- <I>Farabutto! Mortacci sui!</I>



<P>Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman's shelter, an unpretentious

wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely, if ever, been before;

the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent

the keeper of it, said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat, Fitzharris,

the invincible, though he wouldn't vouch for the actual facts, which quite

possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few moments later saw

our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner, only to be greeted

by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays

and other nondescript specimens of the genus <I>homo</I>, already there

engaged in eating and drinking, diversified by conversation, for whom they

seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.



<P>-- Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest

to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the

shape of solid food, say a roll of some description.



<P>Accordingly his first act was with characteristic <I>sangfroid</I> to

order these commodities quietly. The <I>hoi polloi</I> of jarvies or stevedores,

or whatever they were, after a cursory examination, turned their eyes,

apparently dissatisfied, away, though one redbearded bibulous individual,

a portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor, probably, still stared for

some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.



<P>Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just

a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though, to be sure,

rather in a quandary over <I>voglio</I>, remarked to his <I>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</I>

in an audible tone of voice, <I>apropos</I> of the battle royal in the

street which was still raging fast and furious:



<P>-- Beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not write

your poetry in that language? <I>Bella Poetria!</I> it is so melodious

and full. <I>Belladonna voglio</I>.



<P>Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn, if he could, suffering

from dead lassitude generally, replied:



<P>-- To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.



<P>-- Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at

the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than

were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds

it.



<P>The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this <I>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</I>

put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the

table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed, after

which he beat a retreat to his counter. Mr Bloom determining to have a

good square look at him later on so as not to appear to... for which reason

he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours

by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to

be called coffee gradually nearer him.



<P>-- Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little

time. Like names, Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody, Jesus, Mr Doyle.

Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What's in a name?



<P>-- Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our

name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.



<P>The redbearded sailor, who had his weather eye on the newcomers, boarded

Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely

by asking:



<P>-- And what might your name be?



<P>Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion's boot but Stephen,

apparently disregarding the warm pressure, from an unexpected quarter,

answered:



<P>-- Dedalus.



<P>The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather

bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and

water.



<P>-- You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.



<P>-- I've heard of him, Stephen said.



<P>Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping

too.



<P>-- He's Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same

way and nodding. All Irish.



<P>-- All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.



<P>As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business

and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor,

of his own accord, turned to the other Occupants of the shelter with the

remark: I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his

shoulder. The left hand dead shot.



<P>Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures

being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.



<P>-- Bottle Out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles.

Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.



<P>He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely, then

he screwed his features up some way sideways and glared out into the night

with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.



<P>-- Pom, he then shouted once.



<P>The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there

being still a further egg.



<P>-- Pom, he shouted twice.



<P>Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,

<BR>Never missed nor he never will.</BLOCKQUOTE>

A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like asking

him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.



<P>-- Beg pardon, the sailor said.



<P>-- Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.



<P>-- Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic

influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He

toured the wide world with Hengler's Royal Circus. I seen him do that in

Stockholm.



<P>-- Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.



<P>-- Murphy's my name, the sailor continued, W. B. Murphy, of Carrigaloe.

Know where that is?



<P>-- Queenstown Harbour, Stephen replied.



<P>-- That's right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That's

where I hails from. My little woman's down there. She's waiting for me,

I know. <I>For England, home and beauty</I>. She's my own true wife I haven't

seen for seven years now, sailing about.



<P>Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene - the homecoming

to the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones - a

rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a number

of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden

and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O'Leary, a

favourite and most trying declamation piece, by the way, of poor John Casey

and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way? Never about the runaway

wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. The face at the

window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and

the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections.

You little expected me but I've come to stay and make a fresh start. There

she sits, a grass widow, at the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead. Rocked

in the cradle of the deep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the

case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating

rumpsteak and onions. No chair for father. Boo! The wind! Her brandnew

arrival is on her knee, <I>post mortem</I> child. With a high ro! and a

randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin

and bear it. I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband, W. B.

Murphy.



<P>The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one

of the jarvies with the request:



<P>-- You don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you,

do you?



<P>The jarvey addressed, as it happened, had not but the keeper took a

die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object

was passed from hand to hand.



<P>-- Thank you, the sailor said.



<P>He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing, and with some slow stammers,

proceeded:



<P>-- We come up this morning eleven o'clock. The threemaster <I>Rosevean</I>

from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this afternoon.

There's my discharge. See? W. B. Murphy, A. B. S.



<P>In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket

and handed to his neighbours a not very clean looking folded document.



<P>-- You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,

leaning on the counter.



<P>-- Why, the sailor answered, upon reflection upon it, I've circumnavigated

a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and

North America and South America. I seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was

in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles, under Captain Dalton the

best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. <I>Gospodi pomilooy</I>.

That's how the Russians prays.



<P>-- You seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey.



<P>-- Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug, I seen

queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an

anchor same as I chew that quid.



<P>He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his

teeth, bit ferociously.



<P>-- Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses

and the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent

me.



<P>He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket, which seemed

to be in its way a species of repository, and pushed it along the table.

The printed matter on it stated: <I>Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia</I>.



<P>All focused their attention on the scene exhibited, at a group of savage

women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping,

amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside

some primitive shanties of osier.



<P>-- Chews coca all day long, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs

like breadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can't bear no more

children. See them there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse's liver

raw.



<P>His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns

for several minutes, if not more.



<P>-- Know how to keep them off? he inquired genially.



<P>Nobody volunteering a statement, he winked, saying:



<P>-- Glass. That boggles 'em. Glass.



<P>Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the

card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as

follows: <I>Tarjeta Postal. Se&ntilde;or A. Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago,

Chile</I>. There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.

Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping

transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don

Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in <I>Maritana</I> on which occasion the

former's ball passed through the latter's hat), having detected a discrepancy

between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to

be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on

the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive

which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend's <I>bona fides</I>,

nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant

to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London <I>via</I>

long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great

extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate

he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead

which was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work

a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up

with the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it did

come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd's heart it was not

so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside, considering the

fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six there and

back. The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and

be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver

was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth,

Falmouth, Southampton and so on, culminating in an instructive tour of

the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon

where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower, abbey, wealth

of Park Lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing just struck him

as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot

to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer

music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed

bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate

and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou

spots, which might prove highly remunerative. Not, of course, with a hole

and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C. P.

M'Coy type - lend me your valise and I'll post you the ticket. No, something

top notch, an all star Irish cast, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company

with its own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to

the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was

quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be

managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable

wires and thus combine business with pleasure. But who? That was the rub.



<P>Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was

to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with

the times <I>apropos</I> of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was

mooted, was once more on the <I>tapis</I> in the Circumlocution departments

with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom

and dunderheads generally. A great opportunity there certainly was for

push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large,

the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.



<P>It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and

no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when

the system really needed toning up, for a matter of a couple of paltry

pounds, was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead

of being always cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife.

After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it

and merited a radical change of <I>venue</I> after the grind of city life

in the summertime, for choice, when Dame Nature is at her spectacular best,

constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. There were equally excellent

opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots

for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing

tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs,

even, Poulaphouca, to which there was a steam tram, but also farther away

from the madding crowd, in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland,

an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen, so long as it didn't come

down, and in the wilds of Donegal, where if report spoke true, the <I>coup

d'<oe>il</I> was exceedingly grand, though the lastnamed locality was not

easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that

it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it, while

Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace

O'Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel

was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men, especially

in the spring when young men s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths

by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way,

on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour's run

from the pillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet

merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to

be desired. Interesting to fathom, it seemed to him, from a motive of curiosity

pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route

or vice-versa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the other side of

the card picture and passed it along to Stephen.



<P>-- I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had

little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened, and

every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house,

another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the

Chinese does.



<P>Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces, the globetrotter

went on adhering to his adventures.



<P>-- And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his

back. Knife like that.



<P>Whilst speaking he produced a dangerous looking clasp knife, quite in

keeping with his character, and held it in the striking position.



<P>-- In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.

Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. <I>Prepare to

meet your God</I>, says he. Chuck! It went into his back up to the butt.



<P>His heavy glance, drowsily roaming about, kind of defied their further

questions even should they by any chance want to. That's a good bit of

steel, repeated he, examining his formidable <I>stiletto</I>.



<P>After which harrowing <I>d&eacute;nouement</I> sufficient to appal the

stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away

as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.



<P>-- They're great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite

in the dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought

the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of

them using knives.



<P>At this remark, passed obviously in the spirit of <I>where ignorance

is bliss</I>, Mr Bloom and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both

instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the

strictly <I>entre nous</I> variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat,

<I>alias</I> the keeper, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair.

His inscrutable face, which was really a work of art, a perfect study in

itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn't understand

one jot of what was going on. Funny very.



<P>There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading by fits and

starts a stained by coffee evening journal; another, the card with the

natives <I>choza de</I>; another, the seaman's discharge. Mr Bloom, so

far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.

He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well

as yesterday, some score of years previously, in the days of the land troubles

when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early

in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.



<P>-- Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.



<P>The request being complied with, he clawed them up with a scrape.



<P>-- Have you seen the Rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.



<P>The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay,

or no.



<P>-- Ah, you've touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking

he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences

but he failed to do so, simply letting spurt a jet of spew into the sawdust,

and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.



<P>-- What year would that be about? Mr Bloom interpolated. Can you recall

the boats?



<P>Our <I>soi-disant</I> sailor munched heavily awhile, hungrily, before

answering.



<P>-- I'm tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.

Salt junk all the time.



<P>Tired, seemingly, he ceased. His questioner, perceiving that he was

not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,

fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the

globe. Suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed,

it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly

what it meant, to rule the waves. On more than one occasion - a dozen at

the lowest - near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated

old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly

redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him,

dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings. And

it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to find out the secret

for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of

thing and over and under - well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.

And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at

all. Nevertheless, without going into the <I>minutiae</I> of the business,

the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and

in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and

fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people

usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like

the hell idea and the lottery and insurance, which were run on identically

the same lines so that for that very reason, if no other, lifeboat Sunday

was a very laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter

where living, inland or seaside,-is the case might be, having it brought

home to them like that, should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters

and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out

amid the elements, whatever the season, when duty called <I>Ireland expects

that every man</I> and so on, and sometimes had a terrible time of it in

the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable

to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced

some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.



<P>-- There was a fellow sailed with me in the <I>Rover</I>, the old seadog,

himself a rover, proceeded. Went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman's

valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I've on me and he gave

me an oilskin and that jackknife. I'm game for that job, shaving and brushup.

I hate roaming about. There's my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his

mother got him took in a draper's in Cork where he could be drawing easy

money.



<P>-- What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the

side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away

from the carking cares of office, unwashed, of course, and in a seedy getup

and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.



<P>-- Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance. My son Danny?

He'd be about eighteen now, way I figure it.



<P>The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow

shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to

be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink, intended to represent an

anchor.



<P>-- There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked. Sure as nuts.

I must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It's them black lads I objects

to. I hate those buggers. Sucks your blood dry, they does.



<P>Seeing they were all looking at his chest, he accommodatingly dragged

his shirt more open so that, on top of the time honoured symbol of the

mariner's hope and rest, they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young

man's sideface looking frowningly rather.



<P>-- Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were lying

becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton Fellow the name

of Antonio done that. There he is himself, a Greek.



<P>-- Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.



<P>That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the someway

in his. Squeezing or...



<P>-- See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is, cursing the mate.

And there he is now, he added. The same fellow, pulling the skin with his

fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.



<P>And in point of fact the young man named Antonio's livid face did actually

look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved

admiration of everybody, including Skin-the-Goat who this time stretched

over.



<P>-- Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He's

gone too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.



<P>He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression

of before.



<P>-- Neat bit of work, longshoreman one said.



<P>-- And what's the number for? loafer number two queried.



<P>-- Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.



<P>-- Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time,

with some sort of a half smile, for a brief duration only, in the direction

of the questioner about the number. A Greek he was.



<P>And then he added, with rather gallowsbird humour, considering his alleged

end:

<BLOCKQUOTE>-- As bad as old Antonio,

<BR>For he left me on my ownio.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The face of a streetwalker, glazed and haggard under a black straw hat,

peered askew round the door of the shelter, palpably reconnoitring on her

own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom, scarcely

knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment, flusterfied but outwardly

calm, and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street

organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up

and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink? His reason for so

doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had

caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond Quay, the partially

idiotic female, namely, of the lane, who knew the lady in the brown costume

does be with you (Mrs B.), and begged the chance of his washing. Also why

washing, which seemed rather vague than not?



<P>Your washing. Still, candour compelled him to admit that he had washed

his wife's undergarments when soiled in Holles Street and women would and

did too a man's similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper's marking

ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say. Love

me, love my dirty shirt. Still, just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired

the female's room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief

when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. Round the side

of the <I>Evening Telegraph</I> he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her

face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing

that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the

group of gazers round Skipper Murphy's nautical chest and then there was

no more of her.



<P>-- The gunboat, the keeper said.



<P>-- It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking,

how a wretched creature like that from the Lock Hospital, reeking with

disease, can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober

senses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of

course, I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.

Still no matter what the cause is from...



<P>Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:



<P>-- In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a

roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy

the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.



<P>The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude,

said that it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put

a stop to <I>instanter</I> to say that women of that stamp (quite apart

from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were

not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing

he could truthfully state he, as a <I>paterfamilias</I>, was a stalwart

advocate of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of

that sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a

lasting boon on everybody concerned.



<P>-- You, as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe

in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as

distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup? I believe

in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions

of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X

rays, for instance. Do you?



<P>Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to

try and concentrate and remember before he could say:



<P>-- They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore

incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility

of its annihilation by its First Cause, Who, from all I can hear, is quite

capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, <I>corruptio

per se</I> and <I>corruptio per accidens</I> both being excluded by court

etiquette.



<P>Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the

mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he

felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:



<P>-- Simple? I shouldn't think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant

you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue

moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance

to invent those rays R&ouml;ntgen did, Or the telescope like Edison, though

I believe it was before his time, Galileo was the man I mean. The same

applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such

as electricity but it's a horse of quite another colour to say you believe

in the existence of a supernatural God.



<P>-- O, that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several

of the best known passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.

On this knotty point, however, the views of the pair, poles apart as they

were, both in schooling and everything else, with the marked difference

in their respective ages, clashed.



<P>-- Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his

original point. I'm not so sure about that. That's a matter of every man's

opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I

beg to differ with you <I>in toto</I> there. My belief is, to tell you

the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put

in by monks most probably or it's the big question of our national poet

over again, who precisely wrote them, like <I>Hamlet</I> and Bacon, as

you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn't

tell you. Can't you drink that coffee, by the way? Let me stir it and take

a piece of that bun. It's like one of our skipper's bricks disguised. Still,

no one can give what he hasn't got. Try a bit.



<P>-- Couldn't, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the

moment refusing to dictate further.



<P>Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat, Mr Bloom thought well to

stir, or try to, the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something

approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative)

work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a

world of good. Shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal

lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings, and useful lectures

(admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders. On the other hand,

he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion

Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very

modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly

inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition

to speak of. Sulphate of copper poison, SO<FONT SIZE=-2>4</FONT> or something

in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere

but he couldn't remember when it was or where. Anyhow, inspection, medical

inspection, of all eatables, seemed to him more than ever necessary which

possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble's Vi-Cocoa on account of

the medical analysis involved.



<P>-- Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being

stirred.



<P>Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it, Stephen lifted the heavy

mug from the brown puddle - it clopped out of it when taken up - by the

handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.



<P>-- Still, it's solid food, his good genius urged, I'm a stickler for

solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least

but regular meals as the <I>sine qua non</I> for any kind of proper work,

mental or manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different

man.



<P>-- Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But oblige me by taking away that

knife. I can't look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.



<P>Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article,

a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique

about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous

point about it.



<P>-- Our mutual friend's stories are like himself, Mr Bloom, <I>apropos</I>

of knives, remarked to his <I>confidente sotto voce</I>. Do you think they

are genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long

and lie like old boots. Look at him.



<P>Yet still, though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air, life was

full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was

quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication

though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the

spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.



<P>He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him

and Sherlockholmesing him up, ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though

a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,

there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail

delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate

such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. He

might even have done for his man, supposing it was his own case he told,

as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and

had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing

of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical

name who sprang from the pen Of our national poet) who expiated his crimes

in the melodramatic manner above described. On the other hand he might

be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness, because meeting unmistakable mugs,

Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad, would tempt

any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about

the schooner <I>Hesperus</I> and etcetera. And when all was said and done,

the lies a fellow told about himself couldn't probably hold a proverbial

candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.



<P>Mind you, I'm not saying that it's all a pure invention, he resumed.

Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants, though,

that is rather a far cry you see once in a way. Marcella, the midget queen.

In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are

called, sitting bowlegged. They couldn't straighten their legs if you paid

them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his

companion the brief outline, the sinews, or whatever you like to call them,

behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so

long cramped up, being adored as gods. There's an example again of simple

souls.



<P>However, reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who

reminded him a bit of Ludwig, <I>alias</I> Ledwidge, when he occupied the

boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management

in the <I>Flying Dutchman</I>, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers

came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships

of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat

as also did trains), there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about

it, he conceded. On the contrary, that stab in the back touch was quite

in keeping with those Italianos, though candidly he was none the less free

to admit those ice creamers and friers in the fish way, not to mention

the chip potato variety and so forth, over in little Italy there, near

the Coombe, were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit

too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion

of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuck in with garlic

<I>de rigueur</I> off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on

the cheap.



<P>-- Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like

that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own

hands and give you your quietus double quick with those poignards they

carry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally.

My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half, that is. Point of fact she could

actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically)

Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite dark, regular brunette,

black. I, for one, certainly believe climate accounts for character. That's

why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.



<P>-- The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very

passionate about ten shillings. <I>Roberto ruba roba sua</I>.



<P>-- Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.



<P>-- Then, Stephen said, staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown

listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles

triangle, Miss Portinari, he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso

Mastino.



<P>-- It's in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the

blood of the sun. Coincidence, I just happened to be in the Kildare street

Museum today, shortly prior to our meeting, if I can so call it, and I

was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions

of hips, bosom. You simply don't knock against those kind of women here.

An exception here and there. Handsome, yes, pretty in a way you find, but

what I'm talking about is the female form. Besides, they have so little

taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman's natural

beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled stockings - it may be, possibly

is, a foible of mine, but still it's a thing I simply hate to see.



<P>Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and the others

got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions

with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy, of course, had his own

say to say. He had doubled the Cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon,

a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep

there was one thing, he declared, stood to him, or words to that effect,

a pious medal he had that saved him.



<P>So then after that they drifted on to the wreck of Daunt's rock, wreck

of that illfated Norwegian barque - nobody could think of her name for

the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell

remembered it, <I>Palme</I>, on Booterstown Strand, that was the talk of

the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original

verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish <I>Times</I>) breakers

running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified

with horror. Then someone said something about the case of the s. s. <I>Lady

Cairns</I> of Swansea, run into by the <I>Mona</I>, which was on an Opposite

tack, in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. No aid

was given. Her master, the <I>Mona's</I>, said he was afraid his collision

bulkhead would give way. She had no water, it appears, in her hold.



<P>At this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him

to unfurl a reef, the sailor vacated his seat.



<P>-- Let me cross your bows, mate, he said to his neighbour, who was just

gently dropping off into a peaceful dose.



<P>He made tracks heavily, slowly, with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,

stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore

due left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings, Mr Bloom, who

noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship's rum

sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning

interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it, or unscrew, and, applying

its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with

a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion

that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction

in the shape of a female, who, however, had disappeared to all intents

and purposes, could, by straining, just perceive him, when duly refreshed

by his rum puncheon exploit, gazing up at the piers and girders of the

Loop Line, rather out of his depth, as of course it was all radically altered

since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person or persons invisible

directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all

over the place for the purpose but, after a brief space of time during

which silence reigned supreme, the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth,

eased himself close at hand, the noise of his bilge-water some little time

subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently woke a horse of

the cabrank.



<P>A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.

Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brasier of live coke, the watcher

of the corporation, who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was

none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically

on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human

probability, from dictates of humanity, knowing him before - shifted about

and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in the arms of

Morpheus. A truly amazing piece of hard times in its most virulent form

on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home

comforts all his life who came in for a cool #100 a year at one time which

of course the double-barrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and

drakes of. And there he was at the end of his tether after having often

painted the town tolerably pink, without a beggarly stiver. He drank, needless

to be told, and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily

be in a large way of business if - a big if, however - he had contrived

to cure himself of his particular partiality.



<P>All, meantime, were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,

coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same

thing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra Basin,

the only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no

ships ever called.



<P>There were wrecks and wrecks, the keeper said, who was evidently <I>au

fait</I>.



<P>What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only

rock in Galway Bay when the Galway Harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington

or some name like that, eh? Ask her captain, he advised them, how much

palmoil the British Government gave him for that day's work. Captain John

Lever of the Lever line.



<P>-- Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor now returning after

his private potation and the rest of his exertions.



<P>That worthy, picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words,

growled in wouldbe music, but with great vim, some Kind of chanty or other

in seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom's sharp ears heard him then expectorate

the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the

time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs

and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. Anyhow in he

rolled after his successful libation-<I>cum</I>-potation, introducing an

atmosphere of drink into the <I>soir&eacute;e</I>, boisterously trolling,

like a veritable son of a seacook:

<BLOCKQUOTE>-- The biscuits was as hard as brass,

<BR>And the beef as salt as Lot's wife's arse.

<BR>O Johnny Lever!

<BR>Johnny Lever, O!</BLOCKQUOTE>

After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene

and, regaining his seat, he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided.



<P>Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was

airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural

resources of Ireland, or something of that sort, which he described in

his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of

God's earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities,

six million pounds' worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between

butter and eggs, and all the riches drained out of it by England levying

taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always, and gobbling

up the best meat in the market, and a lot more surplus steam in the same

vein. Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that

that was a fact. You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated,

and there was Colonel Everard down there in Cavan growing tobacco. Where

would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning,

he stated <I>crescendo</I> with no uncertain voice - thoroughly monopolising

all the conversation - was in store for mighty England, despite her power

of pelf on account of her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest

fall in history. The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little

lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem

England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles

heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles,

the Greek hero - a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped

their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. His advice

to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland

and live for Ireland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one

of her sons.



<P>Silence all round marked the termination of his <I>finale</I>. The impervious

navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed.



<P>-- Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably

a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.



<P>To which cold douche, referring to downfall and so on, the keeper concurred

but nevertheless held to his main view.



<P>-- Who's the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately

interrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals and

generals we've got? Tell me that.



<P>-- The Irish for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes

apart.



<P>-- That's right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic

peasant. He's the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?



<P>While allowing him his individual opinions, as every man, the keeper

added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman

worthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few irascible

words, when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners

who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn't indulge

in recriminations and come to blows.



<P>From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was

rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,

pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was

fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless

they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their

strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea

in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the

sister island would be played out and if, as time went On, that turned

Out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter

was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might

occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the

most of both countries, even though poles apart. Another little interesting

point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance,

reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against

her, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them,

the licensee of the place, rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the

famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly

as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it

was prearranged, as the lookeron, a student of the human soul, if anything,

the others seeing least of the game. And as for the lessee or keeper, who

probably wasn't the other person at all, he (Bloom) couldn't help feeling,

and most properly, it was better to give people like that the goby unless

you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do

with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there

always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen's

evidence - or king's now - like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly

repudiated. Quite apart from that, he disliked those careers of wrongdoing

and crime on principle. Yet, though such criminal propensities had never

been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel,

and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was), a certain kind

of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel,

with the courage of his political convictions though, personally, he would

never be a party to any such thing, off the same bat as those love vendettas

of the south - have her or swing for her - when the husband frequently,

after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the

other lucky mortal (the man having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal

injuries on



<P>his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial <I>liaison</I>

by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed

Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the

outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to

the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved

his skin on. In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for

our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived

his welcome. He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold

high. Like actresses, always farewell - positively last performance then

come up smiling again. Generous to a fault, of course, temperamental, no

economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the

shadow. So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever

got rid of some #. s. d. in the course of his perambulations round the

docks in the congenial atmosphere of the <I>Old Ireland</I> tavern, come

back to Erin and so on. Then as for the others, he had heard not so long

before the same identical lingo, as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually

silenced the offender.



<P>He took umbrage at something or other, that much injured but on the

whole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew, and

in a heated fashion, offensively. So I, without deviating from plain facts

in the least, told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too, and all his

family, like me, though in reality I'm not. That was one for him. A soft

answer turns away wrath. He hadn't a word to say for himself as everyone

saw. Am I not right?



<P>He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride

at the soft impeachment, with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to

glean in a kind of a way that it wasn't all exactly .



<P>-- <I>Ex quibus</I>, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their

two or four eyes conversing, <I>Christus</I> or Bloom his name is, or,

after all, any other, <I>secundum carnem</I>.



<P>-- Of course, Mr Bloom proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both

sides of the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as

to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is

though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government

it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It's all very fine to

boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality? I resent violence

or intolerance in any shape or form. It never reaches anything or stops

anything. A revolution must come on the due instalments plan. It's a patent

absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the

corner and speak another vernacular, so to speak.



<P>-- Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes' war, Stephen assented,

between Skinner's alley and Ormond market.



<P>-- Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that

was overwhelmingly right and the whole world was overwhelmingly full of

that sort of thing.



<P>-- You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of

conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn't remotely.



<P>All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad

blood - bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed

to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag - were very largely a question

of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy,

people never knowing when to stop.



<P>-- They accuse - remarked he audibly. He turned away from the others,

who probably... and spoke nearer to, so as the others... in case they...



<P>-- Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen's ear, are accused

of ruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History - would

you be surprised to learn? - proves up to' the hilt Spain decayed when

the Inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell,

an uncommonly able ruffian, who, in other respects, has much to answer

for, imported them. Why? Because they are practical and are proved to be

so. I don't want to indulge in any... because you know the standard works

on the subject, and then, orthodox as you are... But in the economic, not

touching religion, domain, the priest spells poverty. Spain again, you

saw in the war, compared with goahead America. Turks, it's in the dogma.

Because if they didn't believe they'd go straight to heaven when they die

they'd try to live better - at least, so I think. That's the juggle on

which the p.p.'s raise the wind on false pretences. I'm, he resumed, with

dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about

at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and

classes <I>pro rata</I> having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard

fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of #300 per annum That's

the vital issue at stake and it's feasible and would be provocative of

friendlier intercourse between man and man. At least that's my idea for

what it's worth. I call that patriotism. <I>Ubi patria</I>, as we learned

a small smattering of in our classical day in <I>Alma Mater, vita bene</I>.

Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.



<P>Over his untasteable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this

synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.

He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those

crabs about Ringsend in the morning, burrowing quickly into all colours

of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath

or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn't say

the words the voice he heard said - if you work.



<P>-- Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning to work.



<P>The eyes were surprised at this observation, because as he, the person

who owned them pro. tem. observed, or rather, his voice speaking did: All

must work, have to, together.



<P>-- I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest

possible sense. Also literary labour, not merely for the kudos of the thing.

Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays. That's

work too. Important work. After all, from the little I know of you, after

all the money expended on your education, you are entitled to recoup yourself

and command your price. You have every bit as much right to live by your

pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has. What? You both belong

to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. Each is equally important.



<P>-- You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I

may be important because I belong to the <I>faubourg Saint Patrice</I>

called Ireland for short.



<P>-- I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.



<P>-- But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important

because it belongs to me.



<P>-- What belongs? queried Mr Bloom, bending, fancying he was perhaps

under some misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately I didn't catch the

latter portion. What was it you?...



<P>Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of

coffee, Or whatever you like to call it, none too politely, adding:



<P>-- We can't change the country. Let us change the subject.



<P>At this pertinent suggestion, Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked

down, but in a quandary, as he couldn't tell exactly what construction

to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some

kind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say, the fumes of his

recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way, foreign

to his sober state. Probably the home life, to which Mr Bloom attached

the utmost importance, had not been all that was needful or he hadn't been

familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of fear for the

young man beside him, whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some

consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more

especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw

much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured

fellows that promised so brilliantly, nipped in the bud of premature decay,

and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance, there was the case of

O'Callaghan, for one, the half crazy faddist, respectably connected, though

of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries, among whose other gay doings

when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was

in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper

(a fact). And then the usual <I>d&eacute;nouement</I> after the fun had

gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited

away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon

of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of

the Criminal Law Amendment Act, certain names of those subpoenaed being

handed in but not divulged, for reasons which will occur to anyone with

a pick of brains. Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen, which

he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes

and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts, even

In the House of Lords, because early in life the occupant of the throne,

then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages

simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected

about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality

such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in

a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy as the law stands

was terribly down on, though not for the reason they thought they were

probably, whatever it was, except women chiefly, who were always fiddling

more or less at one another, it being largely a matter of dress and all

the rest of it. Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every

well tailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo

and give more of a genuine fillip to acts of impropriety between the two,

she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages

in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring

a continental. However, reverting to the original, there were on the other

hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by

the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer force of natural genius, that. With

brains, sir.



<P>For which and further reasons he felt it was interest and duty even

to wait on and profit by the unlooked for occasion, though why, he could

not exactly tell, being, as it was, already several shillings to the bad,

having, in fact, let himself in for it. Still, to cultivate the acquaintance

of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection

would amply repay any small... Intellectual stimulation as such was, he

felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind. Added to which

was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt, of the

here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events,

all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in, especially

as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz., coalminers, divers, scavengers,

etc., were very much under the microscope lately. To improve the shining

hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same

luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing. Suppose he were to

pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at

the rate of one guinea per column, <I>My Experiences</I>, let us say, <I>in

a Cabman's Shelter</I>.



<P>The pink edition, extra sporting, of the <I>Telegraph</I>, tell a graphic

lie, lay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just puzzling

again, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and the preceding

rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard was addressed to

A. Boudin, find the captain's age, his eyes went aimlessly over the respective

captions which came under his special province, the allembracing give us

this day our daily press. First he got a bit of a start but it turned out

to be only something about somebody named H. du Boyes, agent for typewriters

or something like that. Great battle Tokio. Lovemaking in Irish #200 damages.

Gordon Bennett. Emigration swindle. Letter from His Grace William. Ascot

<I>Throwaway</I> recalls Derby of '92 when Captain Marshall's dark horse,

<I>Sir Hugo</I> , captured the blue riband at long odds. New York disaster,

thousand lives lost. Foot and Mouth. Funeral of the late Mr Patrick Dignam.



<P>So to change the subject he read about Dignam, R.I.P., which, he reflected,

was anything but a gay sendoff.



<P>-- <I>This morning</I> (Hynes put it in, of course), <I>the remains

of the late Mr Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge

Avenue, Sandymount, for internment in Clasnevin. The deceased gentleman

was a most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise,

after a brief illness, came as great shock to citizens of all classes by

whom he is deeply regretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the

deceased were present, were carried out</I> (certainly Hynes wrote it with

a nudge from Corny) <I>by Messrs. H. J. O'Neill &amp; Son, 164 North Strand

road. The mourners included: Patk. Dignam (son), Bernard Corrigan (motherinlaw),

John Henry Menton, solr., Martin Cunningham, John Power eatondph 1/8 ador

dorador douradora</I> (must be where he called Monks the dayfather about

Keyes's ad), <I>Thomas Kernan, Simon Dedalus, Stephen Dedalus, B. A., Edward

J. Lambert, Cornelius Kelleher, Joseph M'C. Hynes, L. Boom, C. P. M'Coy,

- M'Intosh, and several others</I>.



<P>Nettled not a little by <I>L. Boom</I> (as it incorrectly stated) and

the line of bitched type, but tickled to death simultaneously by C. P.

M'Coy and Stephen Dedalus, B. A., who were conspicuous, needless to say,

by their total absence (to say nothing of M'Intosh), L. Boom pointed it

out to his companion B. A., engaged in stifling another yawn, half nervousness,

not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of misprints.



<P>-- Is that first epistle to the Hebrews, he asked, as soon as his bottom

jaw would let him, in? Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it.



<P>-- It is, really, Mr Bloom said (though first he fancied he alluded

to the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there could

be no possible connection) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and a bit

flabbergasted at Myles Crawford's after all managing the thing, there.



<P>While the other was reading it on page two Boom (to give him for the

nonce his new misnomer) whiled away a few odd leisure moments in fits and

starts with the account of the third event at Ascot on page three, his

sidevalue 1,000 sovs., with 3,000 sovs. In specie added for entire colts

and fillies, Mr F. Alexander's <I>Throwaway</I>, b.h. by <I>Rightaway</I>,

close order. It was anybody's race then the rank outsider drew to the fore

got long lead, beating lord Howard de Walden's chestnut colt and Mr W.

Bass's bay filly Sceptre on a 2 1/2 mile course. Winner trained by Braine

so that Lenehan's version of the business was all pure buncombe. Secured

the verdict cleverly by a length. 1,000 sovs., with 3,000 in specie. Also

ran J. de Bremond's (French horse Bantam Lyons was anxiously inquiring

after not in yet but expected any minute) <I>Maximum II</I>. Different

ways of bringing off a coup. Lovemaking damages. Though that halfbaked

Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get left. Of course, gambling

eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though, as the event turned

out, the poor fool hadn't much reason to congratulate himself on his pick,

the forlorn hope. Guesswork it reduced itself to eventually.



<P>-- There was every indication they would arrive at that, Mr Bloom said.



<P>-- Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.



<P>One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read,

<I>Return of Parnell</I>. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier

was in that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride

it was killed him. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low

for a time after Committee Room No. 15 until he was his old self again

with no-one to point a finger at him. Then they would all to a man have

gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered

his senses. Dead he wasn't. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they

brought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer

general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.



<P>All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their

memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels, and

not singly but in their thousands, and then complete oblivion because it

was twenty odd years. Highly unlikely, of course, there was even a shadow

of truth in the stories and, even supposing, he thought a return highly

inadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in his

death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his

various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether

it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots

and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult

a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it

amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly

they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands. Of course

nobody being acquainted with his movements even before, there was absolutely

no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the <I>Alice, where

art thou</I> order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases

such as Fox and Stewart, so the remark which emanated from friend cabby

might be within the bounds of possibility. Naturally then, it would prey

on his mind as a born leader of men, which undoubtedly he was, and a commanding

figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged

feet, whereas Messrs So-and-So who, though they weren't even a patch on

the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very

few and far between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of

clay. And then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual

mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You had to come back

- that haunting sense kind of drew you - to show the understudy in the

title <I>r&ocirc;le</I> how to. He saw him once on the auspicious occasion

when they broke up the type in the <I>Insuppressible</I> or was it <I>United

Ireland</I>, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact,

handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said <I>Thank you</I>,

excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid expression notwithstanding

the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip - what's

bred in the bone. Still, as regards return, you were a lucky dog if they

didn't set the terrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot of shillyshally

usually followed. Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And then, number

one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your

credentials, like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne.

<I>Bella</I> was the boat's name to the best of his recollection he, the

heir, went down in, as the evidence went to show, and there was a tattoo

mark too in Indian ink, Lord Bellew, was it? As he might very easily have

picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up

to tally with the description given, introduce himself with, <I>Excuse

me, my name is So-and-So</I> or some such commonplace remark. A more prudent

course, Mr Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished

personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie

of the land first.



<P>-- That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor

commented. She put the first nail in his coffin.



<P>-- Fine lump of a woman, all the same, the <I>soi-disant</I> town-clerk,

Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. I seen her picture in a barber's.

Her husband was a captain or an officer.



<P>-- Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added. He was, and a cottonball one.



<P>This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair

amount of laughter among his <I>entourage</I>. As regards Bloom, he, without

the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the

door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary

interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public

with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them, full of sweet

nothings. First, it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an

attachment sprang up between them, till bit by bit matters came to a climax

and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came

as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however, who were resolved

upon encouraging his downfall though the thing was public property all

along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently

blossomed into. Sino their names were coupled, though, since he was her

declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to

the rank and file from the housetops, the fact namely, that he had shared

her bedroom, which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went

through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape

of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular

date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance

of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion,

a fact that the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined

shoals of money out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was

simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in

common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the

scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms

and forgetting home ties. The usual sequel, to bask in the loved one's

smiles. The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped

up. Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case,

exist between married folk? Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely

if he regarded her with affection carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent

specimen of manhood he was truly, augmented obviously by gifts of a high

order as compared with the other military supernumerary, that is (who was

just the usual everyday <I>farewell, my gallant captain</I> kind of an

individual in the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate), and

inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his

own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly

likely to carve his way to fame, which he almost bid fair to do till the

priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents

and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in

the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf

in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually

cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head,

much in the same way as the fabled ass's kick. Looking back now in a retrospective

kind of arrangement, all seemed a kind of dream. And the coming back was

the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel

out of place as things always moved with the times. Why, as he reflected,

Irishtown Strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years,

looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the

north side. North or south however, it was just the wellknown case of hot

passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and

just bore out the very thing he was saying, as she also was Spanish or

half so, types that wouldn't do things by halves, passionate abandon of

the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.



<P>-- Just bears out what I was saying, he with glowing bosom said to Stephen.

And, if I don't greatly mistake, she was Spanish too.



<P>-- The king of Spain's daughter, Stephen answered, adding something

or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions

and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so

and so many.



<P>-- Was she? Bloom ejaculated surprised, though not astonished by any

means. I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there it

was, as she lived there. So, Spain.



<P>Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket <I>Sweets of</I>, which reminded

him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out

his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents rapidly, finally

he.



<P>-- Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a fades

photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?



<P>Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large

sized lady, with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion, as she

was in the full bloom of womanhood, In evening dress cut ostentatiously

low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than

vision of breasts, her full lips parted, and some perfect teeth, standing

near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano, on the rest of which was <I>In

old Madrid</I>, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue.

Her (the lady's) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about

something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin's premier

photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.



<P>Mrs Bloom, my wife the <I>prima donna</I>, Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom

indicated. Taken a few years since. In or about '96. Very like her then.



<P>Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his

legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian

Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer

having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet

sixteen. As for the face, it was a speaking likeness in expression but

it did not do justice to her figure, which came in for a lot of notice

usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup

She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not

to dwell on certain opulent curves of the... He dwelt, being a bit of an

artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally

because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon, he had seen those

Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum.

Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry. All

the rest, yes, Puritanism. It does though, St Joseph's sovereign... whereas

no photo could, because it simply wasn't art, in a word.



<P>The spirit moving him, he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar's

good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak

for itself on the plea he... so that the other could drink in the beauty

for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which

the camera could not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional

etiquette so, though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully

cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm... And he did

feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward

voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion. Nevertheless, he

sat tight, just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves,

none the worse for wear, however, and looked away thoughtfully with the

intention of not further increasing the other's possible embarrassment

while gauging her symmetry of heaving <I>embonpoint</I>. In fact, the slight

soiling was only an added charm, like the case of linen slightly soiled,

good as new, much better, in fact, with the starch out. Suppose she was

gone when he?... I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his

mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the

morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike

hoses (<I>sic</I>) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately

beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.



<P>The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, <I>distingu&eacute;</I>,

and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch, though

you wouldn't think he had it in him... yet you would. Besides he said the

picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was, though at the moment

she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of make-believe went

on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash

page of letterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct

with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being

honest and aboveboard about the whole business. How they were fated to

meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were

coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the

habitual mushy and compromising expressions, leaving no loophole, to show

that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown

seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became

in due course intimate. Then the decree <I>nisi</I> and the King's Proctor

to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, <I>nisi</I> was made absolute.

But as for that, the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were

in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did

till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor, who filed a petition

for the party wronged in due course. He, Bloom, enjoyed the distinction

of being close to Erin's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred

in the historic fracas when the fallen leader's - who notoriously stuck

to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery

- (leader's) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly

even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the <I>Insuppressible</I>

or no it was <I>United Ireland</I> (a by no means, by the by, appropriate

appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like

that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of

the O'Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation, reflecting

on the erstwhile tribune's private morals. Though palpably a radically

altered man, he was still a commanding figure, though carelessly garbed

as usual, with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with

the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that

their idol had feet of clay, after placing him upon a pedestal, which she,

however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot times

in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty

prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging

some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character.

His hat (Parnell's) was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict

history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing

the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did

with the utmost celerity) who, panting and hatless and whose thoughts were

miles away from his hat at the time, being a gentleman born with a stake

in the country, he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the

kudos of the thing than anything else, what's bred in the bone, instilled

into him in infancy at his mother's knee in the shape of knowing what good

form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked

him with perfect <I>aplomb</I>, saying: <I>Thank you, sir</I> though in

a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession

whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day,

history repeating itself with a difference; after the burial of a mutual

friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of

having committed his remains to the grave.



<P>On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes

of the cabmen and so on, who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately,

pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in

reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties

themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be

a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones,

who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position

locked in one another's arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings

and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness

of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection

and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would

overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones, with tears in her eyes,

though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time, as

quite possibly there were several others. He personally, being of a sceptical

bias, believed, and didn't make the smallest bones about saying so either,

that man, or men in the plural, were always hanging around on the waiting

list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and

they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting

her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life, and was on for a little

flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper

intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause

of many <I>liaisons</I> between still attractive married women getting

on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases

of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.



<P>It was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of

brains, as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time

with profligate women, who might present him with a nice dose to last him

his lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take

unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim

ladies' society was a <I>conditio sine qua non</I> though he had the gravest

possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about

Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought

him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would

find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the

company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi- or tri-weekly

with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentpaying and walking out

leading up to fond lovers' ways and flowers and chocs. To think of him

house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother,

was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things he popped out

with attracted the elder man who was several years the other's senior or

like his father. But something substantial he certainly ought to eat, were

it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing

that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.



<P>-- At what o'clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and

tired though unwrinkled face.



<P>-- Some time yesterday, Stephen said.



<P>-- Yesterday, exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow,

Friday. Ah, you mean it's after twelve!



<P>-- The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.



<P>Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence, Bloom reflected.

Though they didn't see eye to eye in everything, a certain analogy there

somehow was, as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the

one train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some

score of years previously when he had been a <I>quasi</I> aspirant to parliamentary

honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which

was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for

those same ultra ideas. For instance, when the evicted tenants' question,

then at its first inception, bulked largely in people's minds though, it

goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely

to its dictums, some of which wouldn't exactly hold water, he at the outset

in principle, at all events, was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession,

as voicing the trend of modern Opinion, a partiality, however, which, realising

his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of, and even was twitted

with going a step further than Michael Davitt in the striking views he

at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly

resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion at the gathering

of the clans in Barney Kiernan's so that he, though often considerably

misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed

from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard

though so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious

of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of

mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone

conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest,

in a word.



<P>Anyhow, upon weighing the pros and cons, getting on for one as it was,

it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit

risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody

having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as

on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame

paw, not that the cases were either identical or the reverse, though he

had hurt his hand too, to Ontario Terrace, as he very distinctly remembered,

having been there, so to speak. On the other hand it was altogether far

and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he

was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives... Everything

pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of

the opportunity, all things considered. His initial impression was that

he was a bit standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway.

For one thing he mightn't what you call jump at the idea, if approached,

and what mostly worried him was he didn't know how to lead up to it or

word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford

him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin

in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound

up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of

Epps's cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two

and overcoat doubled into a pillow. At least he would be in safe hands

and as warm as a toast on a trivet. He failed to perceive any very vast

amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was

kicked up. A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower

in question, who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn't appear in any

particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown

and it was highly likely some sponger's bawdyhouse of retired beauties

off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character's

whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings

(the mermaids') with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical

calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody's bones and mauling their largesized

charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of

large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to

who he in reality was let XX equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra

remarks <I>passim</I>. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his repartee

to the blood and ouns champion about his God being a jew. People could

put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite

from a sheep. The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles, your God

was a jew, because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon

or somewhere about in the county Sligo.



<P>-- I propose, our hero eventually suggested, after mature reflection

while prudently pocketing her photo, as it's rather stuffy here, you just

come with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the vicinity.

You can't drink that stuff. Wait, I'll just pay this lot.



<P>The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain

sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper

of the shanty, who didn't seem to...



<P>-- Yes, that's the best, he assured Stephen, to whom for the matter

of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.



<P>All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (Bloom's) busy

brain. Education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,

up to date billing, hydros and concert tours in English watering resorts

packed with theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent

perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity of

course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a

slice of luck. An opening was all was wanted. Because he more than suspected

he had his father's voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the

cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail

the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.



<P>The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy,

earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers' association dinner in London

somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement.

Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of

vitality left read out that Sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for

the chief secretary's lodge or words to that effect. To which absorbing

piece of intelligence echo answered why. - Give us a squint at that literature,

grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.



<P>-- And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.



<P>The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles

which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.



<P>-- Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the town

clerk queried.



<P>-- Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was

a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of sea-green

portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading. Sand

in the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the dark, manner

of speaking. <I>The Arabian Nights' Entertainment</I> was my favourite

and <I>Red as a Rose is She</I>.



<P>Thereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,

found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred

and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely

regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently

new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him, as he muttered against

whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough

to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply

looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.



<P>To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first

to rise to his feet so as not to outstay their welcome having first and

foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the

occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host

as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not

looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand

total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers,

literally the last of the Mohicans) he having previously spotted on the

printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite to him in unmistakable

figures, coffee 2d., confectionery do., and honestly well worth twice the

money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark. - Come, he counselled,

to close the <I>s&eacute;ance</I>.



<P>Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear, they left the shelter

or shanty together and the <I>&eacute;lite</I> society of oil skin and

company whom nothing short Of an earthquake would move out of their <I>dolce

far niente</I>. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged

out, paused at the, for a moment... the door to...



<P>-- One thing I never understood, he said, to be original on the spur

of the moment, why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs

upside down on the tables In cafes.



<P>To which impromptu the never failing Bloom replied without a moment's

hesitation, saying straight off:



<P>-- To sweep the floor in the morning.



<P>So saying he skipped around nimbly, considering frankly, at the same

time apologetic, to get on his companion's right, a habit of his, by the

by, the right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The

night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit

weak on his pins.



<P>-- It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk,

in a moment. The only thing is to walk then you'll feel a different man.

It's not far. Lean on me.



<P>Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen's right and led him on

accordingly.



<P>-- Yes, Stephen said uncertainly, because he thought he felt a strange

kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and

all that.



<P>Anyhow, they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier, etc. where the

municipal supernumerary, ex-Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes

wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields

and pastures new. And <I>apropos</I> of coffin of stones, the analogy was

not at all bad, as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo

out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and

chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants

he had put in their holdings.



<P>So they passed on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom,

as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm-in-arm

across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its

way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off

but the music of Mercadante's <I>Huguenots</I>, Meyerbeer's <I>Seven Last

Words on the Cross</I>, and Mozart's <I>Twelfth Mass</I>, he simply revelled

in, the <I>Gloria</I> in that being to his mind the acme of first class

music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat. He

infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything

the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey

hymns or <I>Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be</I>. He

also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini's <I>Stabat Mater</I>,

a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion

Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say greatly

adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade

in the jesuit fathers' church in Upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice

being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or <I>virtuosi</I>

rather. There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up

to her and, suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred

character, there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole,

though favouring preferably light opera of the <I>Don Giovanni</I> description,

and <I>Martha</I>, a gem in its line, he had a <I>penchant</I>, though

with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as

Mendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about

the old favourites, he mentioned <I>par excellence</I> Lionel's air in

<I>Martha, M'appari</I>, which, curiously enough, he heard, or overheard,

to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from

the lips of Stephen's respected father, sung to perfection, a study of

the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen,

in reply to a politely put query, said he didn't but launched out into

praises of Shakespeare's songs, at least of in or about that period, the

lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter Lane near Gerard the herbalist, who

<I>anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus</I>, an instrument he was contemplating

purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom Bloom did not quite recall, though

the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby

and son with their dux and <I>comes</I> conceits and Byrd (William), who

played the virginals, he said, in the Queen's Chapel or anywhere else he

found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.



<P>On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond

the swing chain, a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,

brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not

perfectly certain whether he had caught a right the allusion to sixtyfive

guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity

of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.



<P>By the chains, the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving Bloom,

who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the other's sleeve gently,

jocosely remarking:



<P>-- Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.



<P>They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth

anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite

near, so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh,

because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a

taildangler, a headhanger, putting his hind foot foremost the while the

lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such

a good poor brute, he was sorry he hadn't a lump of sugar but, as he wisely

reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might

crop up. He was just a big foolish nervous noodly kind of a horse, without

a second care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel

in Barney Kiernan's, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face.

But it was no animal's fault in particular if he was built that way like

the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.

Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art

of man barring the bees; whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator, tickle

the small of his back and he sees the joke; chalk a circle for a rooster;

tiger, my eagle eye. These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field

occupied his mind, somewhat distracted from Stephen's words, while the

ship of the street was manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly

interesting old...



<P>-- What's this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging

in <I>medias res</I>, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your

acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.



<P>He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,

image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual blackguard

type they unquestionably had an indubitable hankering after as he was perhaps

not that way built.



<P>Still, supposing he had his father's gift, as he more than suspected,

it opened up new vistas in his mind, such as Lady Fingall's Irish industries

concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.



<P>Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air <I>Youth here has

End</I> by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows

come from. Even more he liked an old German song of <I>Johannes Jeep</I>

about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which

boggled Bloom a bit:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Von der Sirenen Listigkeit

<BR>Tun die Poeten dichten.</BLOCKQUOTE>

These opening bars he sang and translated <I>extempore</I>. Bloom, nodding,

said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means, which

he did.



<P>A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,

which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily,

if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such

as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its

own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate

possessor in the near future an <I>entr&eacute;e</I> into fashionable houses

in the best residential quarters, of financial magnates in a large way

of business and titled people where, with his university degree of B. A.

(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence

the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being

blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other

requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to, so as to the better

worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society's

sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could

militate against you. It was in fact only a matter of months and he could

easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic <I>conversaziones</I>

during the festivities of the Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight

flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies

out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record,

in fact, without giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if

he cared to, could easily have... Added to which of course, would be the

pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with

his tuition fees. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre

he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any

lengthy space of time but a step in the required direction it was, beyond

yea or nay, and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection

on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy

to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.

Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music

like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great

vogue, as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin's musical world after

the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public

by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their <I>genus omne</I>. Yes,

beyond a shadow of a doubt, he could, with all the cards in his hand and

he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place

in the city's esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking

ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given

a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak -

a big if, however - with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the

inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much feted prince

of good fellows and it need not detract from the other by one iota as,

being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature

in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with

his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was

a matter for himself alone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that

was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose

for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all.



<P>The horse was just then... and later on, at a propitious opportunity

he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying Into his private affairs

on the <I>fools step in where angels</I> principle advising him to sever

his connection with a certain budding practitioner, who, he noticed, was

prone to disparage, and even, to a slight extent, with some hilarious pretext,

when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it, which,

in Bloom's humble opinion, threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person's

character - no pun intended.



<P>The horse, having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted,

and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall

on the floor, which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking

globes of turds. Slowly, three times, one after another, from a full crupper,

he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient

in his scythed car.



<P>Side by side Bloom, profiting by the <I>contretemps</I>, with Stephen

passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping

over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen

singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad:

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Und alle Schiffe br&uuml;cken</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent. He merely watched

the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black - one full,

one lean - walk towards the railway bridge, <I>to be married by Father

Maher</I>. As they walked, they at times stopped and walked again, continuing

their <I>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</I> (which of course he was utterly

out of), about sirens, enemies of man's reason, mingled with a number of

other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind

while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper

car who in any case couldn't possibly hear because they were too far simply

sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner <I>street and looked after

their lowbacked car</I>.

Circe</H1></CENTER>

<I>The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled

transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and

danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with

faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and

women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal

and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of

the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under

a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer</I>.



<P>THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.



<P>THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.



<P>(<I>A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling,

jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons

him</I>.)



<P>THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.



<P>THE IDIOT (<I>Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.</I>) Grhahute!



<P>THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?



<P>THE IDIOT (<I>Gobbing.</I>) Ghaghahest.



<P>(<I>They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung

between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled

by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again.

On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack

of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last

bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked

cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her

lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls

sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken

navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At

a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters,

loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a

man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a

room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from

the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings

shrill from a lane</I>.)

(<I>Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy

the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends

him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face</I>.)



<P>STEPHEN <I>Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.</I>



<P>(<I>The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway</I>.)



<P>THE BAWD (<I>Her voice whispering huskily.</I>) Sst! Come here till

I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista</I>.



<P>THE BAWD (<I>Spits in their trail her jet of venom.</I>) Trinity medicals.

Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.



<P>(<I>Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her

shawl across her nostrils</I>.)



<P>EDY BOARDMAN (<I>Bickering.</I>) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful

place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed

hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen

me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her!

Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows

the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Triumphaliter</I>.) <I>Salvi facti i sunt</I>.



<P>(<I>He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering

light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after

him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.</I>)



<P>LYNCH So that?



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Looks behind</I>.) So that gesture, not music, not odours,

would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not

the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.



<P>LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!



<P>STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even

the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.



<P>LYNCH Ba!



<P>STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug?

This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold

my stick.



<P>LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?



<P>STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to <I>la belle dame sans merci</I>, Georgina

Johnson, <I>ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam</I>.



<P>(<I>Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands,

his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned

in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher</I>.)



<P>LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse.

Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.



<P>(<I>They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs

in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb.

The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark.

The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and

ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering

the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.</I>



<P><I>Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools,

middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond

the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves

the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under

the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate

into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait

shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents

to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level

Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of</I> <I>truculent Wellington

but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops

of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.</I>



<P><I>At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright

arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!



<P>(<I>He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming

rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing

Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing

a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with

wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses

a parcel against his rib and groans</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?



<P>(<I>He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset

siding. The glow leaps again</I>.)



<P>BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.



<P>(<I>He stands at Cormack's corner watching</I>.)



<P>BLOOM <I>Aurora borealis</I> or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of

course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush.

We're safe. (<I>He hums cheerfully</I>.) London's burning, London's burning!

On fire, on fire! (<I>He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the

crowd at the farther side of Talbot street</I>.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick.

Better cross here.



<P>(<I>He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout</I>.)



<P>THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (<I>Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns

aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling</I>.)



<P>THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Halts erect stung by a spasm</I>.) Ow.



<P>(<I>He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog</I> <I>a

dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him,

its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman

bangs his footgong</I>.)



<P>THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.



<P>(<I>The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved

hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward,

pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys</I>.)



<P>THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes

a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand</I>.) No thoroughfare.

Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises

again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential.

(<I>He feels his trouser pocket</I>.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily

catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria

peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick.

Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might

be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style

of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken

in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem

of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (<I>He closes his

eyes an instant</I>.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other.

Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!



<P>(<I>A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall,

a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero

the figure regards him with evil eye</I>.)



<P>BLOOM <I>Buenos noches, se&ntilde;orita Blanca, que calle es esta?</I>



<P>THE FIGURE (<I>Impassive, raises a signal arm</I>.) Password. <I>Sraid

Mabbot</I>.



<P>BLOOM Haha. <I>Merci</I>. Esperanto. <I>Slan leath. (He mutters</I>.)

Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.



<P>(<I>He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps

left, ragsackman left</I>.)



<P>BLOOM I beg. (<I>He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted

by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost

my way and contributed to the columns of the <I>Irish Cyclist</I> the letter

headed, In <I>darkest Stepaside</I>. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags

and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes

for. Wash off his sins of the world.



<P>(<I>Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom</I>.)



<P>BLOOM O!



<P>(<I>Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there.

Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket,

sweets of sin, potato soap</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch

your purse.



<P>(<I>The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled

form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan

of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles

hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn

face</I>.)



<P>RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken

goy ever. So. You catch no money.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen,

feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi</I>.



<P>RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (<I>With

feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face</I> <I>of Bloom</I>) Are

you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son

Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers

Abraham and Jacob?



<P>BLOOM (<I>With precaution</I>.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All

that's left of him.



<P>RUDOLPH (<I>Severely</I>.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog

after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?



<P>BLOOM (<I>In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered,

in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch

and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with

stiffening mud</I>.) Harriers, father. Only that once.



<P>RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make

you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Weakly</I>.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy.

I slipped.



<P>RUDOLPH (<I>With contempt) Ooim nachez</I>. Nice spectacles for your

poor mother!



<P>BLOOM Mamma!



<P>ELLEN BLOOM (<I>In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle,

widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens

and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase

banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm</I>.)

O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (<I>She

hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat.

A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out</I>.)

Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?



<P>(<I>Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels

in his filled pockets but desists, muttering</I>.)



<P>A VOICE (<I>Sharply</I>.) Poldy!



<P>BLOOM Who? (<I>He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily</I>.) At your

service.



<P>(<I>He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in

Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet

trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles

her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free

only her lace dark eyes and raven hair</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Molly!



<P>MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak

to me. (<I>Satirically</I>.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so

long?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Shifts from foot to foot</I>.) No, no. Not the least little

bit.



<P>(<I>He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions,

hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound.

A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles

are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a

turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his

bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely

she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him

in Moorish</I>.)



<P>MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.



<P>(<I>The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit,

offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his

head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops

his back for leapfrog</I>.)



<P>BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion...

if you...



<P>MARION So you notice some change? (<I>Her hands passing slowly over

her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes</I>.) O Poldy,

Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide

world.



<P>BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water.

Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (<I>He

pats divers pockets</I>.) This moving kidney. Ah!



<P>(<I>He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon

soap arises, diffusing light and perfume</I>.)



<P>THE SOAP

<BLOCKQUOTE>We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;

<BR>He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(<I>The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appeals in the disc of the

soapsun</I>.)



<P>SWENY Three and a penny, please.



<P>BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.



<P>MARION (<I>Softly</I>.) Poldy!



<P>BLOOM Yes, ma'am?



<P>MARION <I>Ti trema un poco il cuore?</I>



<P>(<I>In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon,

humming the duet from Don Giovanni</I>)



<P>BLOOM Are you sure about that <I>Voglio?</I> I mean the pronunciati...



<P>(<I>He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes

his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering</I>.)



<P>THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched.

Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.



<P>(<I>She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie

Kelly stands</I>.)



<P>BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?



<P>(<I>With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues

with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom.

Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker</I>.)



<P>THE BAWD (<I>Her wolfeyes shining</I>.) He's getting his pleasure. You

won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night

before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.



<P>(<I>Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling,

and shows coyly her bloodied clout</I>.)



<P>GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (<I>She murmurs</I>.)

You did that. I hate you.



<P>BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.



<P>THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman

false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take

the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.



<P>GERTY (<I>To Bloom</I>.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer.

(<I>She paws his sleeve, slobbering</I>.) Dirty married man! I love you

for doing that to me.



<P>(<I>She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with

loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen,

smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth</I>.)



<P>MRS BREEN Mr.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Coughs gravely</I>.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure

by letter dated the sixteenth instant .



<P>MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you

nicely! Scamp!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Hurriedly</I>.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think

me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since

I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having

this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting

quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Holds up a finger</I>.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know

somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (<I>Slily</I>.)

Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Looks behind</I>.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming.

The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello

black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore

christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.



<P>(<I>Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks,

upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap

out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle

the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle

through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe

heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips</I>.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>There's someone in the house with Dina

<BR>There's someone in the house, I know,

<BR>There's someone in the house with Dina

<BR>Playing on the old banjo.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(<I>They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling,

trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>With a sour tenderish smile</I>.) A little frivol, shall we,

if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for

a fraction of a second?



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Screams gaily</I>.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!



<P>BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage

mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner

for you. (<I>Gloomily</I>.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear

gazelle.



<P>MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (<I>She

puts out her hand inquisitively</I>.) What are you hiding behind your back?

Tell us, there's a dear.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Seizes her wrist with his free hand</I>.) Josie Powell that

was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking

back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's

housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the

pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?



<P>MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation

and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings,

blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs,

a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand</I>.) Ladies and gentlemen,

I give you Ireland, home and beauty.



<P>MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Meaningfully dropping his voice</I>.) I confess I'm teapot

with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little

teapot at present.



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Gushingly</I>.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot

and I'm simply teapot all over me. (<I>She rubs sides with him</I>.) After

the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the

staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his

fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which

she surrenders gently</I>.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter

out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (<I>Tenderly, as he slips on her finger

a ruby ring.) L&agrave; ci darem la mano</I>.



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue,

a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her

moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio

e non</I>. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.



<P>BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and

the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (<I>His clenched fist at his

brow</I>.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (<I>Hoarsely</I>.)

Woman, it's breaking me! (<I>Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom

Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard

thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in

the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter</I>.)



<P>ALF BERGAN (<I>Points jeering at the sandwich boards</I>.) U.p.: Up.



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>To Bloom</I>.) High jinks below stairs. (<I>She gives

him the glad eye</I>.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You

wanted to.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Shocked</I>.) Molly's best friend! Could you?



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss</I>.)

Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Off handedly</I>.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without

potted meat is incomplete. I was at <I>Leah</I>. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant

exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling

good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.



<P>(<I>Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears

weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which

a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows

it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked

pills</I>.)



<P>RICHIE Best value in Dub.



<P>(<I>Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his

napkin, waiting to wait</I>.)



<P>PAT (<I>Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy</I>.) Steak

and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.



<P>RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...



<P>(<I>With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching

by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn</I>.)



<P>RICHIE (<I>With a cry of pain, his hand to his back</I>) Ah! Bright's!

Lights!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Points to the navvy</I>.) A spy. Don't attract attention.

I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.



<P>MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and

bull story.



<P>BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here.

But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>All agog</I>.) O, not for worlds.



<P>BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?



<P>MRS BREEN Let's.



<P>(<I>The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen.

The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail</I>.)



<P>THE BAWD Jewman's melt!



<P>BLOOM (<I>In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel,

tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white

spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier

and a grey billycock hat</I>.) Do you remember a long long time, years

and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when

we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider

veil</I>.) Leopardstown.



<P>BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three

year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater

shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on

that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes

advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a

bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like

she did it on purpose...



<P>MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!



<P>BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky

little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired

on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a

pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart

the size of a fullstop.



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Squeezes his arm, simpers</I>.) Naughty cruel I was.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Low, secretly, ever more rapidly</I>.) And Molly was eating

a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly,

though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style.

She was .



<P>MRS BREEN Too.



<P>BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly

were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses,

the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses

was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if

I ever heard or read or knew or came across .



<P>MRS BREEN (<I>Eagerly</I>.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.



<P>(<I>She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on

towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet

apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen

to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour.

An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight</I>.)



<P>THE GAFFER (<I>Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout</I>.) And when

Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after

doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on

the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.



<P>THE LOITERERS (<I>Guffaw with cleft palates</I>.) O jays!



<P>(<I>Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their

lodges they frisk limblessly about him</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad

daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.



<P>THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the

men's porter.



<P>(<I>Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled,

call from lanes, doors, corners</I>.)



<P>THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got

a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.



<P>(<I>He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond.

From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk.

In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats</I>.)



<P>THE NAVVY (<I>Belching</I>.) Where's the bloody house?



<P>THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable

woman.



<P>THE NAVVY (<I>Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them</I>.)

Come on, you British army!



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Behind his back</I>.) He aint half balmy.



<P>PRIVATE COMPTON (<I>LAughs</I>.) What ho!



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>To the navvy</I>.) Portobello barracks canteen. You

ask for Carr. Just Carr.



<P>THE NAVVY (<I>Shouts</I>.)



<P>We are the boys. Of Wexford.



<P>PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?



<P>PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.



<P>THENAVVY (<I>Shouts</I>.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>The galling chain.

<BR>And free our native land.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(<I>He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault.

The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they

are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland

row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with

engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night

or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following

him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs

Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll

lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs.

What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with

that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind.

Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day

two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet

only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What

was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.



<P>(<I>He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend</I> Wet

Dream and <I>a phallic design</I>.)



<P>Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's

that like? (<I>Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window

embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed

floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths</I>.)



<P>THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.



<P>BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get

all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much.

(<I>The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging

his tail</I>.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better

speak to him first. Like women they like <I>rencontres</I>. Stinks like

a polecat. <I>Chacun son go&ucirc;t</I>. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain

in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (<I>The wolfdog sprawls on his

back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling

out</I>.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided

nobody. (<I>Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's

tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one

parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the

trotter</I>.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand.

Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide.

Two and six.



<P>(<I>With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff

mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching

the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur

together</I>.)



<P>THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.



<P>(<I>Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder</I>.)



<P>FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Stammers</I>.) I am doing good to others.



<P>(<I>A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime

with Banbury cakes in their beaks</I>.)



<P>THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.



<P>BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.



<P>(<I>He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over

the munching spaniel</I>.)



<P>BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.



<P>(<I>The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle

between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran

falls silently into an area</I>.)



<P>SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Enthusiastically</I>.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver

on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab.

Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram.

All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.



<P>(<I>Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond

studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a

curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound</I>.)



<P>SIGNOR MAFFEI (<I>With a sinister smile</I>.) Ladies and gentlemen,

my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with

my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted

thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel,

no matter how fractious, even <I>Leo ferox</I> there, the Libyan maneater.

A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced

Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (<I>He glares</I>.) I possess the

Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (<I>With

a bewitching smile</I>.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of

the ring.



<P>FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.



<P>BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (<I>He takes off his

high grade hat, saluting</I>.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have

heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. <I>Donnerwetter</I>! Owns

half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.



<P>FIRST WATCH Proof.



<P>(<I>A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing

a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers

it</I>.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs

John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.



<P>FIRST WATCH (<I>Reads</I>.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully

watching and besetting.



<P>SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower</I>.)

This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his

name. (<I>Plausibly</I>.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom.

The change of name Virag. (<I>He murmurs privately and confidentially</I>.)

We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement.

(He <I>shoulders the second watch gently</I>.) Dash it all. It's a way

we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (<I>He turns gravely

to the first watch</I>.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes.

Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (<I>To the second

watch gaily</I>.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake

of a lamb's tail.



<P>(<I>A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure</I>.)



<P>THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of

the army.



<P>MARTHA (<I>Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the

Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing</I>.) Henry! Leopold!

Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.



<P>FIRST WATCH (<I>Sternly</I>.) Come to the station.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart

and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard

of fellowcraft</I>.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken

identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs

fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I

am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully

condemned.



<P>MARTHA (<I>Sobbing behind her veil</I>.) Breach of promise. My real

name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell

my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Behind his hand</I>.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated.

(<I>He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim</I>.) Shitbroleeth.



<P>SECOND WATCH (<I>Tears in his eyes, to Bloom</I>.) You ought to be thoroughly

well ashamed of yourself.



<P>BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am

a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable

married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street.

My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant

upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one

of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority

for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.



<P>FIRST WATCH Regiment.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Turns to the gallery</I>.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt

of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in

arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police,

guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men,

as physique, in the service of our sovereign.



<P>A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?



<P>BLOOM (<I>His hand on the shoulder of the first watch</I>.) My old dad

too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with

the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General

Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned

in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (<I>With quiet feeling</I>.)

Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.



<P>FIRST WATCH Profession or trade.



<P>BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact

we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the

inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with

the British and Irish press. If you ring up...



<P>(<I>Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His

scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat</I>.<I> He dangles

a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone

receiver nozzle to his ear</I>.)



<P>MYLES CRAWFORD (<I>His cock's wattles</I> wagging.) Hello, seventyseven

eightfour. Hello. <I>Freeman's Urinal</I> and <I>Weekly Arse wiper</I>

here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?



<P>(<I>Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate

morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased

lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled</I>

Matcham's Masterstrokes.)



<P>BEAUFOY (<I>Drawls</I>.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know

it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most

rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly

loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading

as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness

he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect

gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books

of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar,

are a household word throughout the kingdom.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Murmurs with hangdog meekness</I>.) That bit about the laughing

witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?



<P>BEAUFOY (<I>His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court</I>.)

You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't

think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard.

My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord,

we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably

out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims,

who has not even been to a university.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Indistinctly</I>.) University of life. Bad art.



<P>BEAUFOY (<I>Shouts</I>.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral

rottenness of the man! (He <I>extends his portfolio</I>.) We have here

damning evidence, the <I>corpus delicti</I>, my lord, a specimen of my

maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.



<P>A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY

<BLOCKQUOTE>Moses, Moses, king of the jews,

<BR>Wiped his arse in the Daily News.</BLOCKQUOTE>

BLOOM (<I>Bravely</I>.) Overdrawn.



<P>BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter!

(<I>To the court</I>.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple

existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed

society. The arch conspirator of the age.



<P>BLOOM (<I>To the court</I>.) And he, a bachelor, how.



<P>FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.



<P>THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!



<P>(<I>Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket

on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand</I>.)



<P>SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?



<P>MARY DRISCOLL (<I>Indignantly</I>.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable

character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six

pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing

to his carryings on.



<P>FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?



<P>MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself

as poor as I am.



<P>BLOOM (<I>In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless

slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly</I>.) I treated you white.

I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously

I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in

all things. Play cricket.



<P>MARY DRISCOLL (<I>Excitedly</I>.) As God is looking down on me this

night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!



<P>FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?



<P>MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour,

when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety

pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he

interfered twice with my clothing.



<P>BLOOM She counterassaulted.



<P>MARY DRISCOLL (<I>Scornfully</I>.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush,

so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it

quiet!



<P>(<I>General laughter</I>.)



<P>GEORGES FOTTRELL (<I>Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly</I>.)

Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.



<P>(<I>Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins

a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in

his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though

branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve

the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as

a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully

brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been

lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now,

when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life

in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings

of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen

that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway

company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through

the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of

scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper

at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers

to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model

young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting

the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and

green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains

of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops

and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... </I>)



<P>(<I>Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that

they cannot hear</I>.)



<P>LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (<I>Without looking up from their notebooks</I>.)

Loosen his boots.



<P>PROFESSOR MACHUGH (<I>From the presstable, coughs and calls</I>.) Cough

it up, man. Get it out in bits.



<P>(<I>The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket.

Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A

plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly

agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment.

He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A</I>

Titbits <I>back number</I>.)



<P>(<I>Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash,

dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across

his nose, talks inaudibly</I>.)



<P>J. J. O'MOLLOY (<I>In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with

a voice of pained protest</I>.) This is no place for indecent levity at

the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden

nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an

infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and

is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was

due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination,

such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted

in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. <I>Prima facie</I>,

I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy

did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue

was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism.

There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family.

If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest

that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself,

my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission

is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions.

Not all there, in fact.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic

toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly,

passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor

fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing

one thumb heavenward</I>.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (<I>He begins

to lilt simply</I>.)

(<I>He is howled down</I>.)



<P>J. J. O'MOLLOY (<I>Hotly to the populace</I>.) This is a lonehand fight.

By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this

fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded

the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing

for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory

before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person

was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (<I>Bloom

takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips</I>.) I shall call

rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again

at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately

bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly

which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took

the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had

worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him

as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the

mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia

Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (<I>To Bloom</I>.) I suggest

that you will do the handsome thing.



<P>BLOOM A penny in the pound.

<P>DLUGACZ (<I>Hoarsely</I>.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.



<P>(<I>J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his

coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken

eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor.

He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping

tide of rosepink blood</I>.)



<P>J. J. O'MOLLOY (<I>Almost voicelessly</I>.) Excuse me, I am suffering

from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen

words. (<I>He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence

of Seymour Bushe</I>.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught

that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring

deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit

of the doubt. (<I>A paper with something written on it is handed into court</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>In court dress</I>.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan,

Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon,

ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest

afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball,

astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...



<P>MRS YELVERTON BARRY (<I>In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength

ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants

and panache of osprey in her hair</I>.) Arrest him constable. He wrote

me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the

North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch.

He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a

box of the <I>Theatre Royal</I> at a command performance of <I>La Cigale</I>.

I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct

myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time.

He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul

de Kock, entitled <I>The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays</I>.



<P>MRS BELLINGHAM (<I>In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose,

steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses

which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff</I>.) Also to me. Yes,

I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage

door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap

of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop

in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss

culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a

botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of

the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.



<P>MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!



<P>(<I>A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward</I>.)

<P>SECOND WATCH (<I>Produces handcuffs</I>.) Here are the darbies.



<P>MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome

compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound

coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious

of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to

my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial

bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped

or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves

in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden

treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged

me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the

marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.



<P>THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (<I>In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots

cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea

drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt

constantly</I>.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Ph<oe>nix

park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know,

shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings

win the final chukkar on his darling cob <I>Centaur</I>. This plebeian

Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes

an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards,

insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude

senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by

him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero,

evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin

with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an

unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride

and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.



<P>MRS BELLINGHAM Me too.



<P>MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.



<P>(<I>Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters

received from Bloom</I>.)



<P>THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (<I>Stamps her jingling spurs in a

sudden paroxysm of sudden fury</I>.) I will, by the God above me. I'll

scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay

him alive.



<P>BLOOM (<I>His eyes closing, quails expectantly</I>.) Here? (<I>He squirms</I>.)

Again! (<I>He pants cringing</I>.) I love the danger.



<P>THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for

you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.



<P>MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and

stripes on it!



<P>MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married

man!



<P>BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling

glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.



<P>THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (<I>Laughs derisively</I>.) O, did

you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of

your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained

for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.



<P>MRS BELLINGHAM (<I>Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively</I>.)

Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within

an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien</I>.)

O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet.

Let me off this once. (<I>He offers the other cheek</I>.)



<P>MRS YELVERTON BARRY (<I>Severely</I>.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs

Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!



<P>THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (<I>Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently</I>.)

I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped!

To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets.

I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (<I>She

swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air</I>.) Take down his trousers

without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?



<P>BLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.



<P>(<I>Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys</I>.)

<P>THE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin

of this odious pest. Scandalous! (<I>He dons the black cap</I>.) Let him

be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained

in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be

hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril

or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (<I>A black skullcap

<P>(<I>The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron</I>.)



<P>THE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!

are ghouleaten</I>.)



<P>PADDY DIGNAM (<I>In a hollow voice</I>.) It is true. It was my funeral.

<P>BLOOM (<I>In triumph</I>.) You hear?



<P>PADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!



<P>BLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.



<P>SECOND WATCH (<I>Blesses himself</I>.) How is that possible?



<P>FIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.



<P>PADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.



<P>A VOICE O rocks.



<P>PADDY DIGNAM (<I>Earnestly</I>.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H.

Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's

Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines.

The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that

bottle of sherry. (<I>He looks round him</I>.) A lamp. I must satisfy an

animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.



<P>(<I>The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding

a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain,

<P>FATHER COFFEY (<I>Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak</I>.) Namine.

Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.



<P>(<I>Foghorns stormily through his megaphone</I>.) Dignam, Patrick T.,

deceased.



<P>PADDY DIGNAM (<I>With pricked up ears, winces</I>.) Overtones.



<P>(<I>He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground</I>.) My masters'

Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.



<P>(<I>Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed,

his ears cocked</I>.)



<P>PADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.



<P>(<I>He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its

tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat

on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is

heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford,

Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening.

The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling,

cooing</I>.)



<P>THE KISSES (<I>Warbling</I>.) Leo! (<I>Twittering</I>.) Icky licky micky

sticky for Leo! (<I>Cooing</I>.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (<I>Warbling</I>.)

Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (<I>Twittering</I>.) Leeolee! (<I>Warbling</I>.)

O Leo!



<P>(<I>They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks,

silvery sequins</I>.)



<P>BLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.



<P>(<I>Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three

bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips

down the steps and accosts him</I>.)



<P>ZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.



<P>BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?



<P>ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse.

Mother Slipperslapper. (<I>Familiarly</I>.) She's on the job herself tonight

with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for

her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (<I>Suspiciously</I>.)

You're not his father, are you?



<P>BLOOM Not I!



<P>ZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?



<P>(<I>His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over

his left thigh</I>.)



<P>ZOE How's the nuts?



<P>BLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose.

One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.



<P>ZOE (<I>In sudden alarm</I>.) You've a hard chancre.



<P>BLOOM Not likely.



<P>ZOE I feel it.



<P>(<I>Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a</I>

<I>hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist

lips</I>.)



<P>BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.



<P>ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?



<P>(<I>She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm,

cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note,

oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed

with kohol. His smile softens</I>.)



<P>ZOE You'll know me the next time.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Forlornly</I>.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure

to.



<P>(<I>Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes.

Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong

hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by

the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white,

still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth

roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes,

strangely murmuring</I>.)



<P>ZOE (<I>Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously

smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith

Hierushaloim</I>.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Fascinated</I>.) I thought you were of good stock by your

accent.



<P>ZOE And you know what thought did?



<P>(<I>She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on

him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a

sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat

awkward hand</I>.) Are you a Dublin girl?



<P>ZOE (<I>Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil</I>.)

No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?



<P>BLOOM (<I>As before</I>.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish

device. (<I>Lewdly</I>.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder

of rank weed.



<P>ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.



<P>BLOOM (<I>In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating

tie and apache cap</I>.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought

from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence

by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will,

understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years

before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies.

All our habits. Why, look at our public life!



<P>(<I>Midnight chimes from distant steeples</I>.)



<P>THE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!



<P>BLOOM (<I>In alderman's gown and chain</I>.) Electors of Arran Quay,

Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say,

from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's

my programme. <I>Cui Bono?</I> But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their

phantom ship of finance...



<P>AN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!



<P>(<I>The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps</I>.)



<P>THE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!



<P>(<I>Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city

shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice

Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white

silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod

vigorously in agreement</I>.)



<P>LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (<I>In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral

chain and lace white silk scarf</I>) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech

be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he

was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare

hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated

Boulevard Bloom.



<P>COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Impassionedly</I>.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen

as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they?

Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses,

supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous

hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted

labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain

stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf

and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...



<P>(<I>Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring

up. A streamer bearing the legends</I> Cead Mille Failte <I>and</I> Mah

Ttob Melek Israel <I>spans the street. All the windows are thronged with

sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal

Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders

and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys

from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills,

cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering.

The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance

playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted,

trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal

standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of

the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in

a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They

are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin,

the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway,

Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees

and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire

Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order

of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal

Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most

reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland,

the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist,

anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of

the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands

with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers,

law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners,

tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators,

bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters,

corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers,

fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands,

bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato

factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen

of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone,

the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying

the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible.

Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of

welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson

velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb

and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone

with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall.

Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals.

The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid

the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes</I>.)

He scarcely looks thirtyone.



<P>A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest

reformer. Hats off!



<P>(<I>All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly</I>.)



<P>A MILLIONAIRESS (<I>Richly</I>.) Isn't he simply wonderful?



<P>A NOBLEWOMAN (<I>Nobly</I>.) All that man has seen!



<P>A FEMINIST (<I>Masculinely</I>.) And done!



<P>A BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.



<P>(<I>Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest</I>.)



<P>THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor

president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant

ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!



<P>ALL God save Leopold the First!



<P>BLOOM (<I>In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor

with dignity</I>.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.



<P>WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (<I>In purple stock and shovel hat</I>.)

Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments

in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears</I>.) So may

the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.



<P>MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (<I>Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's

head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem</I>. Leopold,

Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!



<P>(<I>Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring.

He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers

put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ

church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks

go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers

do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting</I>.)



<P>THE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.



<P>(<I>Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond.

His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary

transmitters are set for reception of message</I>.)



<P>BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix

hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our

former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene,

the splendour of night.



<P>(<I>The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the

Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent

on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst

of cheering</I>.)



<P><I>JOHN HOWARD PARNELL</I> (<I>Raises the royal standard</I>.) Illustrious

Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Embraces John Howard Parnell</I>.) We thank you from our heart,

John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of

our common ancestors.



<P>(<I>The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter.

The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He

shows all that he is wearing green socks</I>.)



<P>TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.



<P>BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy

at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with

telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do

we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left

our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their

warcry, <I>Bonafide Sabaoth</I>, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.



<P>THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!



<P>JOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.



<P>A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!



<P>AN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you

are.



<P>AN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.



<P>BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell

you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall

ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem

in the Nova Hibernia of the future.



<P>(<I>Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland,

under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem.

It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge

pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension

several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are

temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to

the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked

in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part

of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses</I>.)



<P>THE SIGHTSEERS (<I>Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die</I>.)



<P>(<I>A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points

an elongated finger at Bloom</I>.)



<P>THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man

is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.



<P>BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!



<P>(<I>A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his

sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful

enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees,

are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration

medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars,

free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied

with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock</I>, billets doux <I>in

the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole,

bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40</I> <I>days' indulgences,

spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets

available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian

lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst

Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals

for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth? (historic), Expel that Pain (medic),

Infant's Compendium of the Universe (cosmic), Let's All Chortle (hilaric),

Canvasser's Vade Mecum (journalic), love-letters of Mother Assistant (erotic),

Who's Who in Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's

Way to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward

to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through

the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great

acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings

are held up</I>.)



<P>THE WOMEN Little father! Little father!

<BLOCKQUOTE>Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,

<P>BLOOM (<I>Solemnly</I>.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.



<P>ALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?



<P>BLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments.

New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres

and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory

manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric

dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease.

General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all,

esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers

and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in

a free lay state.



<P>O'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.



<P>DAVY BYRNE (<I>Yawning</I>.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!



<P>BLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.



<P>LENEHAN What about mixed bathing?



<P>(<I>Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration.

All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging

Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also

naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor

Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private

<P>LENEHAN Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!



<P>THE VEILED SIBYL (<I>Enthusiastically</I>.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory

in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the

funniest man on earth.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Winks at the bystanders</I>.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.



<P>THEODORE PUREFOY (<I>In fishing cap and oilskin jacket</I>.) He employs

a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.



<P>THE VEILED SIBYL (<I>Stabs herself</I>.) My hero god! (<I>She dies</I>.)



<P>(<I>Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide

by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening

their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from

the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating

themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish

garters, leaping from windows of different storeys</I>.)



<P>ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (<I>Violently</I>.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites,

the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian

men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of

Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities

of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with

infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of

the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake

faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!



<P>THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!



<P>(<I>Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from

upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial

value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread,

sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Excitedly</I>.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke

again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother

Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the

viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, <I>sgenl inn ban bata

coisde gan capall</I>. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex

specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.



<P>DR MULLIGAN (<I>In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow</I>.)

Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's

private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy

is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis

have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of

chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely

bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake,

and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily

lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning.

I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid

test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to

be <I>virgo intacta.</I>



<P><I>(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs</I>.)



<P>DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations

I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine

in the national teratological museum.



<P>DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid.

Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.



<P>DR PUNCH COSTELLO The <I>fetor judaicus</I> is most perceptible.



<P>DR DIXON (<I>Reads a bill of health</I>.) Professor Bloom is a finished

example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable.

Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow

on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has

written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary

of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything.

He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on

a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas.

He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday.

He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree

reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child.

I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs

have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.



<P>(<I>General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American

makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques,

banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s,

wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly

collected</I>.)



<P>BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.



<P>MRS THORNTON (<I>In nursetender's gown</I>.) Embrace me tight, dear.

You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.



<P>(<I>Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white

children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive

plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably

dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and

interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible

letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor&eacute;e,

Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed

to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing

directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability

companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates</I>.)



<P>A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Darkly</I>.) You have said it.



<P>BROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.



<P>BANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.



<P>(<I>Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes

through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge

by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several

sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical

personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses

Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean

Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes,

Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the

tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger</I>.)

<P>ZOE (<I>Her lucky hand instantly saving him</I>.) Hoopsa! Don't fall

upstairs.



<P>BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (<I>He stands aside at the threshold</I>.)

After you is good manners.



<P>ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.



<P>(<I>She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding

out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall

hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them,

frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown

open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with

an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar

his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly

Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox:

then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade

of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round

a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth

mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped

over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked,

a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy.

The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In

the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged

on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand

he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume,

doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her

hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing

at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset

lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple

at the piano</I>.)



<P>KITTY (<I>Coughs behind her hand</I>.) She's a bit imbecilic. (<I>She

signs with a waggling forefinger</I>.) Blemblem. (<I>Lynch lifts up her

skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly</I>.)

Respect yourself. (<I>She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under

which her hair glows, red with henna</I>.) O, excuse!



<P>ZOE More limelight, Charley. (<I>She goes to the chandelier and turns

the gas full cock</I>.)



<P>KITTY (<I>Peers at the gasjet</I>.) What ails it tonight?



<P>LYNCH (<I>Deeply</I>.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.



<P>ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.



<P>(<I>The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands

at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he

repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble

goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle

in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening.

A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid</I>.)



<P>KITTY (<I>Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot</I>.) O, excuse!



<P>ZOE (<I>Promptly</I>.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your

shift.



<P>(<I>Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over

her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar

on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the

squatted figure with its cap back to the front</I>.)



<P>STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto

Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an

old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate <I>C<oe>la enarrant gloriam Domini</I>.

It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian

and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's

or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his

chief bassoonist about his almightiness. <I>Mais, nom de nom, that is another

pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops,

points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs</I>.) Which side is your knowledge

bump?



<P>THE CAP (<I>With saturnine spleen</I>.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's

reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form

of life. Bah!



<P>STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes.

How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!



<P>THE CAP Bah!



<P>STEPHEN Here's another for you. (<I>He frowns</I>.) The reason is because

the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible

interval which .



<P>THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>With on effort</I>.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible

ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.



<P>THE CAP Which? (<I>Outside the gramophone begins to blare</I> The Holy

City.)



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Abruptly</I>.) What went forth to the ends of the world

to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller,

having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment.

Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself

was ineluctably preconditioned to become. <I>Ecco!</I>



<P>LYNCH (<I>With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins</I>.)

What a learned speech, eh?



<P>ZOE (<I>Briskly</I>.) God help your head, he knows more than you have

forgotten.



<P>(<I>With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen</I>.)



<P>FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.



<P>KITTY No!



<P>ZOE (<I>Explodes in laughter</I>.) Great unjust God!



<P>FLORRY (<I>Offended.)</I> Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ.

O, my foot's tickling.



<P>(<I>Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling</I>.)



<P>THE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea

serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.



<P>(<I>Stephen turns and sees Bloom</I>.)



<P>STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.



<P>(<I>Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his

spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from

which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder

he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass

of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its

breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked,

hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose,

tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness</I>.)



<P>ALL What?



<P>THE HOBGOBLIN (<I>His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his

eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then

all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il

vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round

and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches

juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits!

(The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus.

(The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off

into vacuum</I>.)



<P>FLORRY (<I>Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly</I>.) The end

of the world!



<P>(<I>A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity

occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares

over coughs and feetshuffling</I>.)



<P>THE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...



<P>(<I>A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it,

proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah.

Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End

of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs,

whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs

of Man</I>.)



<P>THE END OF THE WORLD (<I>With a Scotch accent</I>.) Wha'll dance the

keel row, the keel row, the keel row?



<P>(<I>Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice,

harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice

with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which

the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.</I>)



<P>ELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole

Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut.

Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is

12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick

ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop

run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second

advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ,

Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to

sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on

the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the

higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll.

Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation,

and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a

lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with

jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous.

It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and

getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy,

have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's

it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps.

(<I>He shouts</I>.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing.

Encore! (<I>He sings.) Jeru</I>...



<P>THE GRAMOPHONE (<I>Drowning his voice</I>.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.



<P>(<I>The disc rasps gratingly against the needle</I>.)



<P>THE THREE' WHORES (<I>Covering their ears, squawk</I>.) Ahhkkk!



<P>ELIJAH (<I>In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the

top of his voice, his arms uplifted</I>.) Big Brother up there, Mr President,

you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe

strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and

Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't

never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just

now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our

sisters dear. (<I>He winks at his audience</I>.) Our Mr President, he twig

the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.



<P>KITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I

did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister

married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I

was pure.



<P>ZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.



<P>FLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of

Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the

bed.



<P>STEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without

end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.



<P>(<I>The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon,

Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping,

tramp fast past in noisy marching</I>.)



<P>THE BEATITUDES (<I>Incoherently</I>.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum

barnum buggerum bishop.



<P>LYSTER (<I>In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly</I>.)

He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.



<P>(<I>He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered,

his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's

kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat</I>.)



<P>BEST (<I>Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the

crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot</I>.)

I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you

know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (<I>Produces a greencapped dark

lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent</I>.) Esthetics

and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for

a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.



<P>(<I>In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave,

holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees.

He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his

head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His

right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by

its two talons</I>.)



<P>MANANAAN MACLIR (<I>With a voice of waves</I>.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub!

Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos.

(<I>With a voice of whistling seawind</I>.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I

won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the

cult of Shakti. (<I>With a cry of stormbirds</I>.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark

hidden Father! (<I>He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his

left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac.

He wails with the vehemence of the ocean</I>.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am

the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.



<P>(<I>A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes

to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling</I>.)



<P>THE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!



<P>(<I>Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle</I>.)



<P>ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?



<P>LYNCH (<I>Tossing a cigarette on to the table</I>.) Here.



<P>ZOE (<I>Her head perched aside in mock pride</I>.) Is that the way to

hand the <I>pot</I> to a lady? (<I>She stretches up to light the cigarette

over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits.

Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters

up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly

at her cigarette</I>.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?



<P>LYNCH I'm not looking.



<P>ZOE (<I>Makes sheep's eyes</I>.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would

you suck a lemon?



<P>(<I>Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom,

then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue

fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling

his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and

gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate,

chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the

left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears

a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left

eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell.

On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his

ears</I>.)



<P>VIRAG (<I>Heels together bows</I>.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely.

(<I>He coughs thoughtfully, drily</I>.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in

evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that

she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular

devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.



<P>BLOOM Granpapachi. But...



<P>VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse

white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood,

is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone

in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so

performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you

in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?



<P>BLOOM She is rather lean.



<P>VIRAG (<I>Not unpleasantly</I>.) Absolutely! Well observed and those

pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to

suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which

a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe

the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what

you can wear today. Parallax! (<I>With a nervous twitch of his head</I>.)

Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!



<P>BLOOM (<I>An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek</I>.)

She seems sad.



<P>VIRAG (<I>Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left

eye with a finger and barks hoarsely</I>.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper

and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered

by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (<I>More genially</I>.)

Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There

is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated

vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of

the party, longcasted and deep in keel.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Regretfully</I>.) When you come out without your gun.



<P>VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money,

take your choice. How happy could you be with either...



<P>BLOOM With?...



<P>VIRAG (<I>His tongue upcurling</I>.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad.

She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal

in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two

protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday

soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances,

suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing

to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful

nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets

of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of

green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions

of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt

to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (<I>His throat twitches</I>.)

Slapbang! There he goes again.



<P>BLOOM The stye I dislike.



<P>VIRAG (<I>Arches his eyebrows</I>.) Contact with a goldring, they say.

<I>Argumentum ad feminam</I>, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece

in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's

sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (<I>He twitches</I>.)

It is a funny sound.



<P>(<I>He coughs encouragingly</I>.) But possibly it is only a wart. I

presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head?

Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Reflecting</I>.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax.

This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter

of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .



<P>VIRAG (<I>Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking</I>.)

Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten.

Exercise your mnemotechnic. <I>La causa &egrave; santa</I>. Tara. Tara.

(<I>Aside</I>.) He will surely remember.



<P>BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic

tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures.

Mnemo?



<P>VIRAG (<I>Excitedly</I>.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (<I>He

taps his parchmentroll energetically.)</I> This book tells you how to act

with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite,

melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about

amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with

horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar

and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike

women in male habiliments? (<I>With a dry snigger</I>.) You intended to

devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer

months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate!

From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say?

Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated

combinations, camiknickers? (<I>He crows derisively</I>.) Keekeereekee!



<P>(<I>Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled

mauve light, hearing the everflying moth</I>.)



<P>BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence

this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is

will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.



<P>VIRAG (<I>Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper</I>.) Insects of the

day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell

of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal

verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (<I>His yellow parrotbeak gabbles

nasally</I>.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year

five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey

will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice

malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time

we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (<I>He coughs and, bending

his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand</I>.) You shall

find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember

their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth

book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L.

B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are

again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate

sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!



<P>BLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self

then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...



<P>VIRAG (<I>His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key</I>.) Splendid!

Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (<I>He gobbles

gluttonously with turkey wattles</I>.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where

are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (<I>He unrolls his parchment rapidly

and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which

he claws</I>.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters

will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves

may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister

omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis.

Though they stink yet they sting. (<I>He wags head with cackling raillery</I>.)

Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Absently</I>.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always

open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet

Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy

to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way

through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like

those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.



<P>VIRAG (<I>His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly

closed, psalms in outlandish monotone</I>.) That the cows with their those

distended udders that they have been the known...



<P>BLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (<I>He repeats</I>.)

Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their

teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (<I>Profoundly</I>.) Instinct

rules the world. In life. In death.



<P>VIRAG (<I>Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers

at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries</I>.)

Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly

burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit

Well, well. He doth rest anon.

<P>(<I>From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes

forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed

sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed

bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears

dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's

face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and

sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles

down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous

tongue</I>.)

Yes. Not much however.

<P>ARTIFONI <I>Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto</I>.



<P>FLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.



<P>STEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you

the letter about the lute?



<P>FLORRY (<I>Smirking</I>.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.



<P>(<I>The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons

<P>PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with

the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you

got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's

Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.



<P>PHILIP DRUNK (<I>Impatiently</I>.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid

the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow.

Keep in condition. Do like us.



<P>ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business

with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know

you've a Roman collar.



<P>VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (<I>Harshly,

his pupils waxing</I>.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun.

I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why

I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional.

Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (<I>He wriggles</I>.) Woman, undoing with sweet

pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short

time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy

and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with

big lingam, the stiff one. (<I>He cries.) Coactus volui</I>. Then giddy

woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites,

spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (<I>He chases

his tail</I>.) Piffpaff! Popo! (<I>He stops, sneezes.)</I> Pchp! (<I>He

worries his butt</I>.) Prrrrrht!



<P>LYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting

a bishop.



<P>ZOE (<I>Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils</I>.) He couldn't get

a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.



<P>BLOOM Poor man!



<P>ZOE (<I>Lightly</I>.) Only for what happened him.



<P>BLOOM How?



<P>VIRAG (<I>A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage,

cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.)

Verfluchte Goim!</I> He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed.

Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch,

the pope's bastard. (<I>He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent

rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute

world</I>.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.



<P>KITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from

Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow

and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed

for the funeral.



<P>PHILIP DRUNK (<I>Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position,

Philippe?</I>



<P>PHILIP SOBER (<I>Gaily.) C'&eacute;tait le sacr&eacute; pigeon, Philippe.</I>



<P><I>(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna

hair</I>. And <I>a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never

seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off</I>.)



<P>LYNCH (<I>Laughs</I>.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated

anthropoid apes.



<P>FLORRY (<I>Nods</I>.) Locomotor ataxy.



<P>ZOE (<I>Gaily</I>.) O, my dictionary.



<P>LYNCH Three wise virgins.



<P>VIRAG (<I>Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic

lips</I>.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the

Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (<I>He sticks out a

flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork</I>.) Messiah!

He burst her tympanum. (<I>With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips

in the cynical spasm</I>.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!



<P>(<I>Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded,

cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins

and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops</I>.)



<P>BEN POLLARD (<I>Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels

jovially in base barreltone</I>.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.



<P>(<I>The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers

and the ropes and mob him with open arms</I>.)



<P>THE VIRGINS (<I>Gushingly</I>.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!



<P>A VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.



<P>BEN DOLLARD (<I>Smites his thigh in abundant laughter</I>.) Hold him

now.



<P>HENRY (<I>Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs</I>.)

Thine heart, mine love. (<I>He plucks his lutestrings</I>.) When first

I saw.



<P>VIRAG (<I>Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting</I>.)

Rats! (<I>He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an

upward push of his parchment roll</I>.) After having said which I took

my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. <I>Dreck!</I>



<P><I>(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb

and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to

the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly

stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow

flybill, butting it with his head</I>.)



<P>THE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.



<P>HENRY All is lost now.



<P>(<I>Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm</I>.)



<P>VIRAG'S HEAD Quack!



<P>(<I>Exeunt severally</I>.)



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Over his shoulder to Zoe</I>.) You would have preferred

the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes,

the dog sage, and the last end of <I>Anus Heresiarchus</I>. The agony in

the closet.



<P>LYNCH All one and the same God to her.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Devoutly</I>.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.



<P>FLORRY (<I>To Stephen</I>.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a

monk.



<P>LYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.



<P>STEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.



<P>(<I>His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland,

appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven

dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping

under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs

are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs

a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing

his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims

with bloated pomp</I>.)



<P>THE CARDINAL

<BLOCKQUOTE>Conservio lies captured.

<BR>He lies in the lowest dungeon

<BR>With manacles and chains around his limbs

<BR>Weighing upwards of three tons.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(<I>He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left

cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and

fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour</I>.) O, the poor

little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and

heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage

He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.



<P>(<I>A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself

with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims</I>.) I'm suffering

the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny

little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face

of the bloody globe.



<P>(<I>His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers,

imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat

from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers.

The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing,

zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male,

melodious</I>.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee,

And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.



<P>(<I>The trick doorhandle turns</I>.)



<P>THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.



<P>ZOE The devil is in that door.



<P>(<I>A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking

the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily

and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket

and offers it nervously to Zoe</I>.)



<P>ZOE (<I>Sniffs his hair briskly</I>.) Hum. Thank your mother for the

rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep,

pricks his ears</I>.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double

event?



<P>ZOE (<I>Tears open the silverfoil</I>.) Fingers was made before forks.

(<I>She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts

and then turns kittenishly to Lynch</I>.) No objection to French lozenges?

(<I>He nods. She taunts him</I>.) Have it now or wait till you get it?

(<I>He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle.

His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her</I>.)

Catch.



<P>(<I>She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites

it through with a crack</I>.)



<P>KITTY (<I>Chewing</I>.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have

lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with

his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.



<P>BLOOM (<I>In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic

forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards

the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with

impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right

arm downwards from his left shoulder</I>.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever

you are.



<P>(<I>A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside.

Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly.

Zoe offers him chocolate</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Solemnly</I>.) Thanks.



<P>ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.



<P>(<I>A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Takes the chocolate</I>.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla

calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus.

Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad.

Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (<I>He eats</I>.) Influence taste too, mauve.

But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better

late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.



<P>(<I>The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She

is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled

selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck

in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are

deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy,

slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace

pendant beryl eardrops</I>.)



<P>BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.



<P>(<I>She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom

with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face,

neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter</I>.)



<P>THE FAN (<I>Flirting quickly, then slowly</I>.) Married, I see.



<P>BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .



<P>THE FAN (<I>Half opening, then closing</I>.) And the missus is master.

Petticoat government.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Looks down with a sheepish grin</I>.) That is so.



<P>THE FAN (<I>Folding together, rests against her eardrop</I>.) Have you

forgotten me?



<P>BLOOM Yes. No.



<P>THE FAN (<I>Folded akimbo against her waist</I>.) Is me her was you

dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the

same now we? (<I>Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Wincing</I>.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber

which women love.



<P>THE FAN (<I>Tapping</I>.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Cowed</I>.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your

domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak,

with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too

late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open

at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according

to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica

in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower,

was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of

tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David

and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A

dog's spittle, as you probably... (<I>He winces</I>.) Ah!



<P>RICHIE GOULDING (<I>Bagweighted, passes the door</I>.) Mocking is catch.

Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.



<P>THE FAN (<I>Tapping</I>.) All things end. Be mine. Now.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Undecided</I>.) All now? I should not have parted with my

talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my

time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.



<P>THE FAN (<I>Points downwards slowly</I>.) You may.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace</I>.

) We are observed.



<P>THE FAN (<I>Points downwards quickly</I>.) You must.



<P>BLOOM (<I>With desire, with reluctance</I>.) I can make a true black

knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for

Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy.

I knelt once before today. Ah!



<P>(<I>Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to

the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked.

Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers

draws out and in her laces</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Murmurs lovingly</I>.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was

my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace

up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly

small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily

to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.



<P>THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Crosslacing</I>.) Too tight?



<P>THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.



<P>BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar

dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That

night she met... Now!



<P>(<I>He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises

his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow

dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.



<P>BELLO (<I>With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice</I>.) Hound

of dishonour!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Infatuated</I>.) Empress!



<P>BELLO (<I>His heavy cheekchops sagging</I>.) Adorer of the adulterous

rump!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Plaintively</I>.) Hugeness!



<P>BELLO Dungdevourer!



<P>BLOOM (<I>With sinews semiflexed</I>.) Magnificence.



<P>BELLO Down! (<I>He taps her on the shoulder with his fan</I>.) Incline

feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling.

On the hands down!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing</I>.)

Truffles!



<P>(<I>With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting,

snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut

tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most

excellent master</I>.)



<P>BELLO (<I>With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his

shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport

skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in

his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in</I>.)

Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's

glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Enthralled, bleats</I>.) I promise never to disobey.



<P>BELLO (<I>Laughs loudly</I>.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in

store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in!

I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek

me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to

be inflicted in gym costume.



<P>(<I>Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe</I>.



<P>ZOE (<I>Widening her slip to screen her</I>.) She's not here.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Closing her eyes</I>.) She's not here.



<P>FLORRY (<I>Hiding her with her gown</I>.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello.

She'll be good, sir.



<P>KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.



<P>BELLO (<I>Coaxingly</I>.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you,

darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk,

sweety. (<I>Bloom puts out her timid head</I>.) There's a good girly now.

(<I>Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward</I>.) I only want

to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender

behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Fainting</I>.) Don't tear my.



<P>BELLO (<I>Savagely</I>.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the

hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the

Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember

me for the balance of your natural life. (<I>His forehead veins swollen,

his face congested</I>.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning

after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle

of Guinness's porter. (<I>He belches</I>.) And suck my thumping good Stock

Exchange cigar while I read the <I>Licensed Victualler's</I> Gazette. Very

possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy

a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked

like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.



<P>(<I>He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!



<P>BELLO (<I>Twisting</I>.) Another!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Screams</I>.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body

aches like mad!



<P>BELLO (<I>Shouts</I>.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's

the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting,

damn you. (<I>He slaps her face</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...



<P>BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.



<P>ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.



<P>FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.



<P>KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.



<P>(<I>The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy

bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin

stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door</I>.)



<P>MRS KEOCH (<I>Ferociously</I>.) Can I help? (<I>They hold and pinion

Bloom</I>.)



<P>BELLO (<I>Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke,

nursing a fat leg</I>.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond

Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters.

Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me

about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider <I>Throwaway</I>

at twenty to one. (<I>He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear</I>.)

Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Goaded, buttocksmothered</I>.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!



<P>BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never

prayed before. (<I>He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar</I>.) Here,

kiss that. Both. Kiss. (<I>He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's

knees, calls in a hard voice</I>.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross.

I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (<I>He bends sideways and squeezes

his mount's testicles roughly, shouting</I>.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse

you in proper fashion. (<I>He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle</I>.)

The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the

gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.



<P>FLORRY (<I>Pulls at Bello</I>.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I

asked before you.



<P>ZOE (<I>Pulling at Florry</I>.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him

yet, suckeress?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Stifling</I>.) Can't.



<P>BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (<I>He holds in his breath</I>.) Curse it.

Here. This bung's about burst. (<I>He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting

his features, farts loudly</I>.) Take that! (<I>He recorks himself</I>)

Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.



<P>BLOOM (<I>A sweat breaking out over him</I>.) Not man. (<I>He sniffs</I>.)

Woman.



<P>BELLO (<I>Stands up</I>.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed

for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest,

a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your

male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously

rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Shrinks</I>.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must

I tip-touch it with my nails?



<P>BELLO (<I>Points to his whores</I>.) As they are now, so will you be,

wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits.

Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with

cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone

busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your

figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks,

pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course,

with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent

for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little

chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness

of lace round your bare knees will remind you...



<P>BLOOM (<I>A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace

male hands and nose, leering mouth</I>.) I tried her things on only once,

a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save

the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.



<P>BELLO (<I>Jeers</I>.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and

showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn

blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender,

eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short

trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs

Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?



<P>BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.



<P>BELLO (<I>Guffaws</I>.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You

were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and

lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated

by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor

Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury

of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&amp;Aelig;sus, the varsity

wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs,

dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (<I>He guffaws again</I>.) Christ, wouldn't

it make a Siamese cat laugh?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Her hands and features working</I>.) It was Gerald converted

me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High

School play <I>Vice Versa</I>. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated

by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds

his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.



<P>BELLO (<I>With wicked glee</I>.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When

you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on

the smoothworn throne.



<P>BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (<I>Earnestly</I>.)

And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.



<P>BELLO (<I>Sternly</I>.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in

the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing,

sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your

swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The

sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.



<P>THE SINS OF THE PAST (<I>In a medley of voices</I>.) He went through

a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of

the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn

at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to

the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal

strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached

to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages

offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively

smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting

couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in

bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet

paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and

a postal order?



<P>BELLO (<I>Whistles loudly</I>.) Say! What was the most revolting piece

of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out.

Be candid for once.



<P>(<I>Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering,

Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling,

Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the</I>...

)



<P>BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought

the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...



<P>BELLO (<I>Peremptorily</I>.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing.

Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line

of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I

give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !



<P>BLOOM (<I>Docile, gurgles</I>.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...



<P>BELLO (<I>Imperiously</I>.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue!

Speak when you're spoken to.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Bows</I>.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!



<P>(<I>He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall</I>.)



<P>BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes,

also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned

up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (<I>He places

a ruby ring on her finger</I>.) And there now! With this ring I thee own.

Say, thank you, mistress.



<P>BLOOM Thank you, mistress.



<P>BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in

the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one.

Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne.

Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you

on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss,

with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your

wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered

with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights

of old laid down their lives. (<I>He chuckles</I>.) My boys will be no

end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come

here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded

heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named

Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman

out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of

all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What

offers? (<I>He points</I>.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and

carry, basket in mouth. (<I>He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in

Bloom's vulva</I>.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you

a hardon? (<I>He shoves his arm in a bidder's face</I>.) Here, wet the

deck and wipe it round!



<P>A BIDDER A florin!



<P>(<I>Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell</I>.)



<P>A VOICE One and eightpence too much.



<P>THE LACQUEY Barang!



<P>CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.



<P>BELLO (<I>Gives a rap with his gavel</I>.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure

and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points.

Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If

I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid

gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's

milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa,

my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (<I>He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup</I>.)

So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?



<P>A DARKVISAGED MAN (<I>In disguised accent</I>.) Hoondert punt sterlink.



<P>VOICES (<I>Subdued</I>.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.



<P>BELLO (<I>Gaily</I>.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly

short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette,

is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the

long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts

of the <I>blas&eacute;</I> man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk

on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the

thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination

to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger

in mouth</I>.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.



<P>BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (<I>He

stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds

of Bloom's haunches</I>.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's

your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy,

sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy

a bucket or sell your pump. (<I>Loudly</I>.) Can you do a man's job?



<P>BLOOM Eccles Street.



<P>BELLO (<I>Sarcastically</I>.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the

world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned,

my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well

for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts

all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee,

belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he

has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months,

my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts

already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (<I>He spits

in contempt</I>.) Spittoon!



<P>BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds.

Unmentionable. I.



<P>BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.



<P>BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...



<P>BELLO (<I>Ruthlessly</I>.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's

will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years.

Return and see.



<P>(<I>Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold</I>.)



<P><I>SLEEPY HOLLOW</I> Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!



<P>BLOOM (<I>In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing,

fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond

panes, cries out</I>.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's!

But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.



<P>BELLO (<I>Laughs mockingly</I>.) That's your daughter, you owl, with

a Mullingar student.



<P>(<I>Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab

in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls,

her young eyes wonderwide</I>.)



<P>MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!



<P>BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote,

Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and

his men friends are living there in clover. <I>The Cuckoos' Rest!</I> Why

not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot,

exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless

dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander,

O.



<P>BLOOM They... I



<P>BELLO (<I>Cuttingly</I>.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette

carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp

to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue

you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate

the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook

of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling

brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.



<P>BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return.

I will prove...



<P>A VOICE Swear!



<P>(<I>Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between

his teeth</I>.)



<P>BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your

secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You

are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.



<P>BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?



<P>(<I>He bites his thumb</I>.)



<P>BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace

about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to

hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have

none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our

shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my

stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with

a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the

buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (<I>He explodes in

a loud phlegmy laugh</I>.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (<I>He pipes scoffingly</I>.)

Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Clasps his head</I>.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned!

I have suff... (<I>He weeps tearlessly</I>.)



<P>BELLO (<I>Sneers</I>.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!



<P>(<I>Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face

to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised,

in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph

Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie

Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With

swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom</I>.)



<P>THE CIRCUMCISED (<I>In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit

upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad</I>.



<P>VOICES (<I>Sighing</I>.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom?

Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so?

Ah, yes.



<P>(<I>From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall

of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with

hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto

and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom</I>.)



<P>THE YEWS (<I>Their leaves whispering</I>.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.



<P>THE NYMPH (<I>Softly</I>.) Mortal! (<I>Kindly</I>.) Nay, dost not weepest!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight,

with dignity</I>.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of

habit.



<P>THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster

picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh

tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act,

the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of

rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb

callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary

articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman.

Useful hints to the married.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Lifts a turtle head towards her lap</I>.) We have met before.

On another star.



<P>THE NYMPH (<I>Sadly</I>.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied

to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited

testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed

four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.



<P>BLOOM You mean <I>Photo Bits?</I>



<P>THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me

above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four

places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Humbly kisses her long hair</I>.) Your classic curves, beautiful

immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty,

almost to pray.



<P>THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Quickly</I>.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the

worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of

my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the

rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some

days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive

vent. (<I>He sighs</I>.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.



<P>THE NYMPH (<I>Her fingers in her ears</I>.) And words. They are not

in my dictionary.



<P>BLOOM You understood them?



<P>THE YEWS Ssh.



<P>THE NYMPH (<I>Covers her face with her hand</I>.) What have I not seen

in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Apologetically</I>.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong

side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long

ago.



<P>THE NYMPH (<I>Bends her head</I>.) Worse! Worse!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Reflects precautiously</I>.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't

her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after

weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed

utensil which has only one handle.



<P>(<I>The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade</I>.)



<P>THE WATERFALL

<BLOCKQUOTE>Poulaphouca Poulaphouca

<BR>Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.</BLOCKQUOTE>

THE YEWS (<I>Mingling their boughs</I>.) Listen. Whisper. She is right,

our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous

summer days.



<P>JOHN WYSE NOLAN (<I>In the background, in Irish National For ester's

uniform, doffs his plumed hat</I>.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days,

trees of Ireland!



<P>THE YEWS (<I>Murmuring</I>.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school

excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile

grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered

stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge</I>.) I was

in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the

mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned

tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the

herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist

of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End

of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.



<P>(<I>Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys

and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen

Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing

of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom</I>.)



<P>THE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!



<P>(<I>They cheer</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent

snowballs, struggles to rise</I>.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark!

Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (<I>He cheers feebly</I>.)

Hurray for the High School!



<P>THE ECHO Fool!



<P>THE YEWS (<I>Rustling</I>.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (<I>Whispered

kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the

boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom</I>.) Who profaned

our silent shade?



<P>THE NYMPH (<I>Coyly through parting fingers</I>.) There! In the open

air?



<P>THE YEWS (<I>Sweeping downward</I>.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin

sward.

THE NYMPH (<I>With wide fingers</I>.) O! Infamy!



<P>BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of

the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time.

Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired,

I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's

operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto

Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked

tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides,

who saw?



<P>(<I>Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with

humid nostrils through the foliage</I>.)



<P>STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.



<P>BLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (<I>With pathos</I>.) No girl would

<P>(<I>High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered,

<P>THE NANNYGOAT (<I>Bleats</I>.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine</I>.)

Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (<I>He gazes intently downwards

on the water</I>.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare.

Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (<I>Through

silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly

from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters</I>.)



<P>THE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?



<P>(<I>Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the</I> Erin's

<P>COUNCILLOR NANNETI (<I>Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced,

her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my

epitaph be written. I have...



<P>BLOOM Done. Prff.



<P>THE NYMPH (<I>Loftily</I>.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not

such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat

electric light. (<I>She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing

her forefinger in her mouth</I>.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then

could you... ?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Pacing the heather abjectly</I>.) O, I have been a perfect

pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to

which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton

Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.



<P>THE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (<I>She blushes and makes

a knee</I>.) And the rest.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Dejected</I>.) Yes. <I>Peccavi!</I> I have paid homage on

that living altar where the back changes name. (<I>With sudden fervour</I>.)

For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules...

<P>(<I>Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems,

<P>THE VOICE OF VIRAG (<I>A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war

panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast

<P>BLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit

where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to

grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white

What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (<I>He

Reynard?

cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks</I>.) Poli... !

Grease.



<P>(<I>The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him</I>.)



<P>BELLA You'll know me the next time.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Composed, regards her.) Pass&eacute;e</I>. Mutton dressed

as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last

thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin

drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They

have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple

screw propeller.



<P>BELLA (<I>Contemptuously</I>.) You're not game, in fact. (<I>Her sowcunt

barks</I>.) Fohracht!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Contemptuously</I>.) Clean your nailless middle finger first,

the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful

<P>(<I>She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking

out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her</I>.)



<P>STEPHEN (With <I>exaggerated politeness</I>.) This silken purse I made

out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me.

Kinch and Lynch. <I>Dans ce bordel o&ugrave; tenons nostre &eacute;tat</I>.



<P>LYNCH (<I>Calls from the hearth</I>.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing

<P>STEPHEN (<I>Hands Bella a coin</I>.) Gold. She has it.



<P>BELLA (<I>Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty</I>.) Do

you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Delightedly</I>.) A hundred thousand apologies. (<I>He fumbles

again and takes out and hands her two crowns</I>.) Permit, <I>brevi manu</I>,

my sight is somewhat troubled.



<P>(<I>Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to

himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over

Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist,

<P>FLORRY (<I>Strives heavily to rise</I>.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (<I>She

kiss you.



<P>ZOE (<I>Points</I>.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (<I>Lynch bends Kitty

<P>BLOOM This is yours.



<P>STEPHEN How is that? <I>Le distrait</I> or absentminded beggar. (<I>He

fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object

falls</I>.) That fell.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches</I>.) This.



<P>STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Quietly</I>.) You had better hand over that cash to me to

take care of. Why pay more?



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Hands him all his coins</I>.) Be just before you are generous.



<P>BLOOM I will but is it wise? (<I>He counts</I>.) One, seven, eleven,

and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.



<P>STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing

says. Thirsty fox. (<I>He laughs loudly</I>.) Burying his grandmother.

Probably he killed her.



<P>BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.



<P>STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.



<P>BLOOM No, but...



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Comes to the table</I>.) Cigarette, please. (<I>Lynch tosses

a cigarette from the sofa to the table</I>.) And so Georgina Johnson is

dead and married. (<I>A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at

it</I>.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (<I>He strikes a match and

proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy</I>.)



<P>LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it

if you held the match nearer.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Brings the match nearer his eye</I>.) Lynx eye. Must get

glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees

all flat. (<I>He draws the match away. It goes out</I>.) Brain thinks.

Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (<I>He frowns mysteriously</I>.)

Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.



<P>ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with

him.



<P>FLORRY (<I>Nods</I>.) Mr Lambe from London.



<P>STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.



<P>LYNCH (<I>Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem</I>.

(<I>The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws

it into the grate</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (<I>To Zoe</I>.)

You have nothing?



<P>ZOE Is he hungry?



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of

the bloodoath in the</I> Dusk of the Gods.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>Hangende Hunger,

ZOE (<I>Tragically</I>.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (<I>She takes

his hand</I>.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (<I>She points to

his forehead</I>.) No wit, no wrinkles. (<I>She counts</I>.) Two, three,

Mars, that's courage. (<I>Stephen shakes his head</I>.) No kid.



<P>LYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake.

(<I>To Zoe</I>.) Who taught you palmistry?



<P>ZOE (<I>Turns</I>.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (<I>To Stephen</I>.)

I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (<I>She frowns with lowered

<P>LYNCH (<I>Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice</I>.) Like that. Pandy

bat.



<P>(<I>Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies

<P>FATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little

<P>(<I>Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee

<P>DON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very

<P>ZOE (<I>Examining Stephen's palm</I>.) Woman's hand.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Murmurs</I>.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could

read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.



<P>ZOE What day were you born?



<P>STEPHEN Thursday. Today.



<P>ZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (<I>She traces lines on his hand</I>.)

Line of fate. Influential friends.



<P>FLORRY (<I>Pointing</I>.) Imagination.



<P>ZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (<I>She peers at his hands

<P>BLOOM (<I>Detaches her fingers and offers his palm</I>.) More harm than

good. Here. Read mine.



<P>BELLA Show. (<I>She turns up Bloom's hand</I>.) I thought so. Knobby

knuckles, for the women.



<P>ZOE (<I>Peering at Bloom's palm</I>.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea

<P>BLOOM Wrong.



<P>ZOE (<I>Quickly</I>.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband.

That wrong?



<P>(<I>Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches

her wings and clucks</I>.)



<P>BLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.



<P>(<I>She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Points to his hand</I>.) That weal there is an accident. Fell

and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.



<P>ZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.



<P>STEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years

ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse.

(<I>He winces</I>.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?



<P>(<I>Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and

writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves</I>.)



<P>FLORRY What?



<P>(<I>A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked

mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes

Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches

behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy

gaze</I>.)



<P>THE BOOTS (<I>Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.</I>)

Haw, haw, have you the horn?



<P>(<I>Bronze by gold they whisper</I>.)



<P>ZOE (<I>To Florry</I>.) Whisper.



<P>(<I>They whisper again.)</I>



<P><I>(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set

sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and

white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder</I>.)



<P>LENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off

a few quims?



<P>BOYLAN (<I>Seated, smiles</I>.) Plucking a turkey.



<P>LENEHAN A good night's work.



<P>BOYLAN (<I>Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks</I>.)

Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (<I>He holds out a forefinger</I>.)

Smell that.



<P>LENEHAN (<I>Smells gleefully</I>.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!



<P>ZOE AND FLORRY (<I>Laugh together</I>.) Ha ha ha ha.



<P>BOYLAN <I>bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear</I>.

) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?



<P>BLOOM (<I>In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings

and powdered wig</I>.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...



<P>BOYLAN (<I>Tosses him sixpence</I>.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and

splash. (<I>He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head</I>.)

Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?



<P>BLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.



<P>MARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (<I>She plops splashing

out of the water</I>.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt.

Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.



<P>BOYLAN (<I>A merry twinkle in his eye</I>.) Topping!



<P>BELLA What? What is it?



<P>(<I>Zoe whispers to her</I>.)



<P>MARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write

to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals

out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped

receipt.



<P>BELLA (<I>Laughing</I>.) Ho ho ho ho.



<P>BOYLAN (<I>To Bloom, over his shoulder</I>.) You can apply your eye

to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few

times.



<P>BLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness

the deed and take a snapshot? (<I>He holds an ointment jar</I>.) Vaseline,

sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...



<P>KITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.



<P>(<I>Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping

loudly, poppysmic plopslop</I>.)



<P>MINA KENNEDY (<I>Her eyes upturned</I>.) O, it must be like the scent

of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her!

Stuck together! Covered with kisses!



<P>LYDIA DOUCE (<I>Her mouth opening</I>.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her

round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris

and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.



<P>KITTY (<I>Laughing</I>.) Hee hee hee.



<P>BOYLAN'S VOICE (<I>Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach</I>.)

Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!



<P>MARION'S VOICE (<I>Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat</I>.) O! Weeshwashtkissima,

<P>BLOOM (<I>His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself</I>) Show! Hide! Show!

Plough her! More! Shoot!



<P>BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!



<P>LYNCH (<I>Points</I>.) The mirror up to nature. (<I>He laughs</I>.)

Hu hu hu hu hu hu.



<P>(<I>Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare,

beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection

of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall</I>.)



<P>SHAKESPEARE (<I>In dignified ventriloquy</I>.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks

the vacant mind. (<I>To Bloom</I>.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest

invisible. Gaze. (<I>He crows with a black capon's laugh</I>.) Iagogo!

How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Smiles yellowly at the whores</I>.) When will I hear the joke?



<P>ZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.



<P>BLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements

were taken near the skin after his death...



<P>(<I>Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk,

tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry,

rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood

of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers

and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance

policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy

hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling,

Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with

the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft</I>.)



<P>FREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!



<P>SUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!



<P>SHAKESPEARE (<I>With paralytic rage</I>.) Weda seca whokilla farst.



<P>(<I>The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares

beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside.

Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono

gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily</I>.)



<P>MRS CUNNINGHAM (<I>Sings</I>.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.



<P>MARTIN CUNNINGHAM



<P>(<I>Gazes on her impassive</I>.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!



<P>STEPHEN <I>Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti</I>. Queens lay with prize bulls.

Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first

confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of

the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.



<P>BELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.



<P>LYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.



<P>ZOE (<I>Runs to Stephen and links him</I>.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.



<P>(<I>Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where

he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile

on his face</I>.)



<P>LYNCH (<I>Pommelling on the sofa</I>.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.

<P>STEPHEN Mark me. I dreamt of a watermelon.



<P>ZOE Go abroad and love a foreign lady.



<P>LYNCH Across the world for a wife.



<P>FLORRY Dreams go by contraries.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Extending his arms</I>.) It was here. Street of harlots.

In Serpentine Avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the

red carpet spread?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Approaching Stephen</I>.) Look.



<P>STEPHEN No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without

end. (<I>He cries.) Pater!</I> Free!



<P>BLOOM I say, look...



<P>STEPHEN Break my spirit, will he? <I>O merde alors! (He cries, his vulture

talons sharpened</I>.) Hola! Hillyho!



<P>(<I>Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready</I>.)



<P>SIMON That's all right. (<I>He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling,

uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings</I>.) Ho,

boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes.

Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying!

An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms!

Hai, boy!



<P>(<I>The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country.

A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother,

runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves.

The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry,

beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen

live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile

Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters

with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey

negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players,

thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard

hats clamour deafeningly</I>.)

prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their

saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock

<P>STEPHEN (<I>Cracking his fingers impatiently</I>.) Quick! Quick! Where's

my augur's rod? (<I>He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating

his foot in tripudium</I>.)



<P>ZOE (<I>Turns the drumhandle</I>.) There.



<P>(<I>She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start

forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin,

in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape,

bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering.

He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of

arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing</I>.)



<P>ZOE (<I>Twirls around herself heeltapping</I>.) Dance. Anybody here

for there? Who'll dance?



<P>(<I>The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude

to</I> My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. <I>Stephen throws his ashplant on the

table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table

towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins

to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals

a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains,

Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat.

With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates

in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream

tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight

lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is

a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges

it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows

and fondles his flower and buttons</I>.)



<P>MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with

Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment.

The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (<I>He

minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant!

R&eacute;v&eacute;rence! Tout le monde en place!</I>



<P><I>(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels,

shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz

time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade,

gold, rose, violet</I>.)



<P>THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls,

girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.



<P>(<I>From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish

blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their

skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked,

high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting

their arms</I>.)



<P>MAGINNI (<I>Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr&eacute;! Avant deux!</I>

Breathe evenly! <I>Balance!</I>



<P><I>(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing

<P>HOURS O, but lightly!



<P>CAVALIERS O, so lightly!



<P>THE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.



<P>(<I>Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours

advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their

cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze

with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze</I>.)



<P>MAGINNI <I>Avant! huit! Travers&eacute;! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois&eacute;!</I>

<P>BUCK MULLIGAN (<I>Shakes his curling capbell</I>.) The mockery of it!

Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (<I>Tears of

molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone</I>.) Our great sweet mother!

<I>Epi oinopa ponton</I>.



<P>THE MOTHER (<I>Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of

wetted ashes</I>.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men

in the world. You too. Time will come.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Choking with fright, remorse and horror</I>.) They said

I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.



<P>THE MOTHER (<I>A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth</I>.)

You sang that song to me. <I>Love's bitter mystery</I>.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Eagerly</I>.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now.

The word known to all men.



<P>THE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey

with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers?

Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline

manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.



<P>STEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!



<P>THE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that

boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved

you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.



<P>ZOE (<I>Fanning herself with the grate fan</I>.) I'm melting!



<P>FLORRY (<I>Points to Stephen</I>) Look! He's white.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Goes to the window to open it more</I>.) Giddy.



<P>THE MOTHER (<I>With smouldering eyes</I>.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Panting</I>.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!



<P>THE MOTHER (<I>Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen

breath</I>.) Beware! (<I>She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly

towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers</I>.) Beware! God's

hand! (<I>A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning

claws in Stephen's heart</I>.)



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Strangled with rage</I>.) Shite! (<I>His features grow drawn

and grey and old</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>At the window</I>.) What?



<P>STEPHEN <I>Ah non, par exemple!</I> The intellectual imagination! With

me all or not at all. <I>Non serviam!</I>



<P>FLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (<I>She rushes out</I>.)



<P>THE MOTHER (<I>Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately</I>.) O

Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine

Sacred Heart!



<P>STEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring

you all to heel!



<P>THE MOTHER (<I>In the agony of her deathrattle</I>.) Have mercy on Stephen,

Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love,

grief and agony on Mount Calvary.



<P>STEPHEN <I>Nothung!</I>



<P><I>(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier.

Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of

all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry</I>.)



<P>THE GASJET Pwfungg!



<P>BLOOM Stop!



<P>LYNCH (<I>Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand</I>.) Here! Hold

on! Don't run amok!



<P>BELLA Police!



<P>(<I>Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back

stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the

door</I>.)

<BR>BELLA (<I>Screams</I>.) After him!



<P>(<I>The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede

from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns</I>.)



<P>THE WHORES (<I>Jammed in the doorway, pointing</I>.) Down there.



<P>ZOE (<I>Pointing</I>.) There. There's something up.



<P>BELLA Who pays for the lamp? (<I>She seizes Bloom's coattail</I>.) There.

You were with him. The lamp's broken.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Rushes to the hall, rushes back</I>.) What lamp, woman?



<P>A WHORE He tore his coat.



<P>BELLA (<I>Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points</I>.) Who's

to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Snatches up Stephen's ashplant</I>.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't

you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...



<P>BELLA (<I>Loudly</I>.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel.

A ten shilling house.



<P>BLOOM (<I>His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet

lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant</I>.) Only

the chimney's broken. Here is all he...



<P>BELLA (<I>Shrinks back and screams</I>.) Jesus! Don't!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Warding off a blow</I>.) To show you how he hit the paper.

There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!



<P>FLORRY (<I>With a glass of water enters</I>.) Where is he?



<P>BELLA Do you want me to call the police?



<P>BLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student.

Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (<I>He makes

a masonic sign</I>.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You

don't want a scandal.



<P>BELLA (<I>Angrily</I>.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the

boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he?

I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (<I>She shouts</I>.) Zoe! Zoe!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Urgently</I>.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (<I>Warningly</I>.)

I know.



<P>BELLA (<I>Almost speechless</I>.) Who are you incog?



<P>ZOE (<I>In the doorway</I>.) There's a row on.



<P>BLOOM What? Where? (He throws <I>a shilling on the table and shouts</I>.)

That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (<I>He hurries out

through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from

her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly,

pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives

a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the

halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car

with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall

uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher

replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey.

Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his

caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face.

Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens

on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him,

torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack

of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho

cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the

scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their

tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags,

gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes,

eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound,

<P>STEPHEN (<I>With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly</I>.)

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and

seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>To Cissy Caffrey</I>.) Was he insulting you?



<P>STEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.

<BR>VOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's.

What's up? Soldiers and civilians.



<P>CISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to

do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the

man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads</I>.) Hail, Sisyphus.

(<I>He points to himself and the others</I>.) Poetic. Neopoetic.



<P>VOICES She's faithfultheman.



<P>CISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.



<P>PRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff

him one, Harry.



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>To Cissy</I>.) Was he insulting you while me and him

was having a piss?



<P>LORD TENNYSON (<I>In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded,

flowingbearded</I>.) Their's not to reason why.



<P>PRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>To Private Compton</I>. ) I don't know your name but you

are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men

in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.



<P>CISSY CAFFREY (<I>To the crowd</I>.) No, I was with the private.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Amiably</I>.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion

every lady for example...



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>His cap awry, advancing to Stephen</I>.) Say, how would

it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Looks up in the sky</I>.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art

of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (<I>He waves his hand</I>)

Hand hurts me slightly. <I>Enfin, ce sont vos oignons</I>.



<P>(<I>To Cissy Caffrey</I>.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?



<P>DOLLY GRAY (<I>From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign

of the heroine of Jericho</I>.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to

Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.



<P>(<I>The soldiers turn their swimming eyes</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously</I>.)

Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Turns</I>.) Eh? (<I>He disengages himself</I>) Why should

I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate

orange? (<I>He points his finger</I>.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk

to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.



<P>(<I>He staggers a pace back</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Propping him</I>.) Retain your own.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Laughs emptily</I>.) My centre of gravity is displaced.

I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle

for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar

and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (<I>He taps his brow</I>.)

But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.



<P>BIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor

out of the college.



<P>CUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.



<P>BIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.



<P>CUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Pulls himself free and comes forward</I>.) What's that

you're saying about my king?



<P>(<I>Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey

on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of

Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns'

horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company

of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect

and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his

left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed:</I> D&eacute;fense

d'uriner. <I>A roar of welcome greets him</I>.)



<P>EDWARD THE SEVENTH (<I>Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly</I>.) Peace,

perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (<I>He

turns to his subjects</I>.) We have come here to witness a clean straight

fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar

a back.



<P>(<I>He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom

and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously

in acknowledgement</I>.)



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>To Stephen</I>.) Say it again.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up</I>.) I understand your

point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the

age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is

the point. You die for your country, suppose. (<I>He places his arm on

Private Carr's sleeve</I>.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let

my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it

to die. Damn death. Long live life!



<P>EDWARD THE SEVENTH (<I>Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and

with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face</I>.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>My methods are new and are causing surprise.

STEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (<I>He falls back a pace</I>.) Come somewhere

and we'll... What was that girl saying?...



<P>PRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one

into Jerry.



<P>BLOOM (<I>To the privates, softly</I>.) He doesn't know what he's saying.

Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster.

I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Nods, smiling and laughing</I>.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar

and judge of impostors.



<P>PRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't

give a bugger who he is.



<P>STEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.



<P>(<I>Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day

porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!



<P>BLOOM (<I>To Stephen</I>.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Swaying</I>.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.



<P>BIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.



<P>THE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.



<P>THE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers!

Up King Edward!

RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (<I>Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances

with a gladstone bag which he opens</I>.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased

by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife

of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate

female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved

from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.



<P>(<I>He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag

him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently</I>.)



<P>THE CROPPY BOY <I>Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.</I>



<P><I>(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts

of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs

forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up</I>.)



<P>RUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (<I>He undoes the noose</I>.) Rope which

hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness.

(<I>He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out

his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails</I>.) My painful

duty has now been done. God save the king!

PRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Throws up his hands</I>.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing.

He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some

brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (<I>He searches his pockets vaguely</I>.)

Gave it to someone.



<P>PRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Tries to move off</I>.) Will some one tell me where I am

<P>STEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that

eats her farrow!



<P>OLD GUMMY GRANNY (<I>Rocking to and fro</I>.) Ireland's sweetheart,

the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners

to them! (<I>She keens with banshee woe</I>.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the

kine! (<I>She wails</I>.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she

stand?



<P>STEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person

of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.



<P>CISSY CAFFREY (<I>Shrill</I>.) Stop them from fighting!



<P>A ROUGH Our men retreated.



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Tugging at his belt</I>.) I'll wring the neck of any

<P>PRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.



<P>STEPHEN Did I? When?



<P>BLOOM (<I>To the redcoats</I>.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish

missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by

VOICES Police!



<P>DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!



<P>(<I>Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling

guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse

commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns

hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves

rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands,

swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks,

climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls,

albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles.

The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats

and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with

a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches,

arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the

void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes

they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy

clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts

above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty

sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters.

It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange

in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry

sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel

O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell,

Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny,

lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of

the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre

of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise

from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower

two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone

Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice

resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat

and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates

camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and

mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants

<P>CISSY CAFFREY (<I>Pulling Private Carr</I>.) Come on, you're boosed.

He insulted me but I forgive him. (<I>Shouting in his ear</I>.) I forgive

him for insulting me.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Over Stephen's shoulder</I>.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Breaks loose.)</I> I'll insult him.



<P>(<I>He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in

the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his

face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it

up</I>.)



<P>MAJOR TWEEDY (<I>Loudly</I>.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!



<P>THE RETRIEVER (<I>Barking furiously</I>.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.



<P>THE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The

soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's

fainted!



<P>(<I>The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily</I>.)



<P>What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence?

Let them go and fight the Boers!



<P>THE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with

his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.



<P>(<I>They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit</I>.)



<P>THE RETRIEVER (<I>Barking</I>.) Wow wow wow.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Shoves them back, loudly</I>.) Get back, stand back!



<P>PRIVATE COMPTON (<I>Tugging his comrade</I>.) Here bugger off, Harry.

There's the cops!



<P>(<I>Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group</I>)



<P>FIRST WATCH What's wrong here?



<P>PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted

my chum. (<I>The retriever barks</I>.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?



<P>CISSY CAFFREY (<I>With expectation</I>.) Is he bleeding?



<P>A MAN (<I>Rising from his knees</I>.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all

right.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Glances sharply at the man</I>.) Leave him to me. I can easily...



<P>SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Lurches towards the watch</I>.) He insulted my lady

friend.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Angrily</I>.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness.

Constable, take his regimental number.



<P>SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty.

PRIVATE COMPTON (<I>Pulling his comrade</I>.) Here, bugger off, Harry.

Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.



<P>PRIVATE CARR (<I>Staggering as he is pulled away</I>.) God fuck old

Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.



<P>FIRST WATCH (<I>Taking out his notebook</I>.) What's his name?



<P>BLOOM (<I>Peering over the crowd</I>.) I just see a car there. If you

give me a hand a second, sergeant.



<P>FIRST WATCH Name and address.



<P>(<I>Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand,

appears among the bystanders</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Quickly</I>.) O, the very man! (<I>He whispers</I>.) Simon

Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.



<P>SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.



<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>To the watch, with drawling eye</I>.) That's all

right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (<I>He

laughs</I>.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?



<P>FIRST WATCH (<I>Turns to the crowd</I>.) Here, what are you all gaping

at? Move on out of that.



<P>(<I>The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane</I>.)



<P>CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (<I>He

laughs, shaking his head</I>.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse.

What? Eh, what?



<P>FIRST WATCH (<I>Laughs</I>.) I suppose so.



<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Nudges the second watch</I>.) Come and wipe your

name off the slate. (<I>He lilts, wagging his head</I>.) With my tooraloom

tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?



<P>SECOND WATCH (<I>Genially</I>.) Ah, sure we were too.



<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Winking</I>.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round

there.



<P>SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.



<P>CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn</I>.) Thank you

very much gentlemen, thank you. (<I>He mumbles confidentially</I>.) We

don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly

respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.



<P>FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.



<P>SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.



<P>FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to

report it at the station.



<P>BLOOM (<I>Nods rapidly</I>.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden

duty.



<P>SECOND WATCH It's our duty.



<P>CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.



<P>THE WATCH (<I>Saluting together</I>.) Night, gentlemen. (<I>They move

off with slow heavy tread</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Blows</I>.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a

car?.



<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder

to the car brought up against the scaffolding</I>.) Two commercials that

were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two

quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly

girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.



<P>BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...



<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Laughs</I>.) Sure they wanted me to join in with

the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself.

(<I>He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye</I>.) Thanks be to God

we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!



<P>BLOOM (<I>Tries to laugh</I>.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was

just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor

fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and

I was just making my way home...



<P>(<I>The horse neighs</I>.)



<P>THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!



<P>CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after

we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and

got off to see. (<I>He laughs</I>.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will

I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?



<P>BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.



<P>(<I>Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls

at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down</I>.)



<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>Scratches his nape</I>.) Sandycove! (<I>He bends

down and calls to Stephen</I>.) Eh! (<I>He calls again</I>.) Eh! He's covered

with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.



<P>BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.



<P>CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll

shove along. (<I>He laughs</I>.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying

the dead. Safe home!



<P>THE HORSE (<I>Neighs</I>.) Hohohohohome.



<P>BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...



<P>(<I>Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse

harness jingles</I>.)



<P>CORNY KELLEHER (<I>From the car, standing</I>.) Night.



<P>BLOOM Night.



<P>(<I>The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The

car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat

sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey

joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom

shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher

reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what

else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that

is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner

of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand.

Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay.

The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo

lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and

ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the

shoulder</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Eh! Ho! (<I>There is no answer he bends again</I>.) Mr Dedalus!

(<I>There is no answer</I>.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (<I>He

bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate

form</I>.) Stephen! (<I>There is no answer. He calls again</I>.) Stephen!



<P>STEPHEN (<I>Groans</I>.) Who? Black panther vampire. (<I>He sighs and

stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) </I>Who...

drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...



<P>(<I>He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together</I>.)



<P>BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (<I>He bends again and undoes the

buttons of Stephen's waistcoat</I>.) To breathe. (<I>He brushes the wood

shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers</I>.) One

pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (<I>He listens</I>.) What!



<P>(<I>Murmurs</I>.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>... shadows... the woods

<BR>... white breast... dim...</BLOCKQUOTE>

(<I>He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding

his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens

and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and

form</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Communes with the night</I>.) Face reminds me of his poor

mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught.

A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (<I>He murmurs</I>.)...

swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or

parts, art or arts... (<I>He murmurs</I>.) in the rough sands of the sea.

a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...



<P>(<I>Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his

lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears

slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton

suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his

hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page</I>.)



<P>BLOOM (<I>Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly</I>.) Rudy!



<P>RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing,

smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby

buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet

howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)

PINEAPPLE ROCK, LEMON PLATT, BUTTER SCOTCH. A SUGARSTICKY GIRL shovelling

scoopfuls of creams for a christian brother. Some school treat. Bad for

their tummies. Lozenge and comfit manufacturer to His Majesty the King.

God. Save. Our. Sitting on his throne, sucking red jujubes white.



<P>A sombre Y.M.C.A. young man, watchful among the warm sweet fumes of

Graham Lemon's, placed a throwaway in a hand of Mr Bloom.



<P>Heart to heart talks.



<P>Bloo... Me? No.



<P>Blood of the Lamb.



<P>His slow feet walked him riverward, reading. Are you saved? All are

washed in the blood of the lamb. God wants blood victim. Birth, hymen,

martyr, war, foundation of a building, sacrifice, kidney burntoffering,

druid's altars. Elijah is coming. Dr John Alexander Dowie, restorer of

the church in Zion, is coming.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Is coming! Is coming!! Is coming!!!

<BR>All heartily welcome.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Paying game. Torry and Alexander last year. Polygamy. His wife will put

the stopper on that. Where was that ad some Birmingham firm the luminous

crucifix? Our Saviour. Wake up in the dead of night and see him on the

wall, hanging. Pepper's ghost idea. Iron nails ran in.



<P>Phosphorus it must be done with. If you leave a bit of codfish for instance.

I could see the bluey silver over it. Night I went down to the pantry in

the kitchen. Don't like all the smells in it waiting to rush out. What

was it she wanted? The Malaga raisins. Thinking of Spain. Before Rudy was

born. The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny. Very good for the brain.



<P>From Butler's monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor's walk.

Dedalus' daughter there still outside Dillon's auctionrooms. Must be selling

off some old furniture. Knew her eyes at once from the father. Lobbing

about waiting for him. Home always breaks up when the mother goes. Fifteen

children he had. Birth every year almost. That's in their theology or the

priest won't give the poor woman the confession, the absolution. Increase

and multiply. Did you ever hear such an idea? Eat you out of house and

home. No families themselves to feed. Living on the fat of the land. Their

butteries and larders. I'd like to see them do the black fast Yom Kippur.

Crossbuns. One meal and a collation for fear he'd collapse on the altar.

A housekeeper of one of those fellows If you could pick it out of her.

Never pick it out of her. Like getting L. s. d. out of him. Does himself

well. No guests. All for number one. Watching his water. Bring your own

bread and butter. His reverence. Mum's the word.



<P>Good Lord, that poor child's dress is in flitters. Underfed she looks

too. Potatoes and marge, marge and potatoes. It's after they feel it. Proof

of the pudding. Undermines the constitution.



<P>As he set foot on O'Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from

the parapet. Brewery barge with export stout. England. Sea air sours it,

I heard. Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see the

brewery. Regular world in itself. Vats of porter, wonderful. Rats get in

too. Drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating. Dead drunk on

the porter. Drink till they puke again like christians. Imagine drinking

that! Rats: vats. Well of course if we knew all the things.



<P>Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt quay

walls, gulls. Rough weather outside. If I threw myself down? Reuben J's

son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. One and eightpence

too much. Hhhhm. It's the droll way he comes out with the things. Knows

how to tell a story too.



<P>They wheeled lower. Looking for grub. Wait.



<P>He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. Elijah thirtytwo feet

per sec is com. Not a bit. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of swells,

floated under by the bridge piers. Not such damn fools. Also the day I

threw that stale cake out of the Erin's King picked it up in the wake fifty

yards astern. Live by their wits. They wheeled, flapping.

<BLOCKQUOTE>The hungry famished gull

<BR>Flaps o'er the waters dull.</BLOCKQUOTE>

That is how poets write, the similar sounds. But then Shakespeare has no

rhymes: blank verse. The flow of the language it is. The thoughts. Solemn.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Hamlet, I am thy father's spirit

<BR>Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth.</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- Two apples a penny! Two for a penny!



<P>His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand. Australians

they must be this time of year. Shiny peels: polishes them up with a rag

or a handkerchief.



<P>Wait. Those poor birds.



<P>He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes

for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into

the Liffey. See that? The gulls swooped silently two, then all, from their

heights, pouncing on prey. Gone. Every morsel.



<P>Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his

hands. They never expected that. Manna. Live on fishy flesh they have to,

all sea birds, gulls, seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swim down here sometimes

to preen themselves. No accounting for tastes. Wonder what kind is swanmeat.

Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.



<P>They wheeled, flapping weakly. I'm not going to throw any more. Penny

quite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. They spread foot and

mouth disease too. If you cram a turkey, say, on chestnut meal it tastes

like that. Eat pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish are

not salty? How is that?



<P>His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor

on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.



<P><I>Kino's</I>



<P>11/-



<P><I>Trousers</I>.



<P>Good idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How can you

own water really? It's always flowing in a stream, never the same, which

in the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream. All kind of places

are good for ads. That quack doctor for the clap used to be stuck up in

all the greenhouses. Never see it now. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.

Didn't cost him a red like Maginni the dancing master self advertisement.

Got fellows to stick them up or stick them up himself for that matter on

the q.t. running in to loosen a button. Fly by night. Just the place too.

POST NO BILLS. POST 110 PILLS. Some chap with a dose burning him.



<P>If he...



<P>O!



<P>Eh?



<P>No... No.



<P>No, no. I don't believe it. He wouldn't surely?



<P>No, no.



<P>Mr Bloom moved forward raising his troubled eyes. Think no more about

that. After one. Timeball on the ballast office is down. Dunsink time.

Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball's. Parallax. I never

exactly understood. There's a priest. Could ask him. Par it's Greek: parallel,

parallax. Met him pikehoses she called it till I told her about the transmigration.

O rocks!



<P>Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballast office. She's

right after all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.

She's not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I was thinking.

Still I don't know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice.

He has legs like barrels and you'd think he was singing into a barrel.

Now, isn't that wit? They used to call him big Ben. Not half as witty as

calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an albatross. Get outside of

a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at storing away number one Bass. Barrel

of Bass. See? it all works out.



<P>A procession of whitesmocked men marched slowly towards him along the

gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains. Like that priest

they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He read the scarlet

letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S. Wisdom Hely's. Y

lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed

it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Our staple food. Three bob

a day, walking along the gutters, street after street. Just keep skin and

bone together, bread and skilly. They are not Boyl: no: M'Glade's men.

Doesn't bring in any business either. I suggested to him about a transparent

show cart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks,

envelopes, blotting paper. I bet that would have caught on. Smart girls

writing something catch the eye at once. Everyone dying to know what she's

writing. Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing. Have a finger

in the pie. Women too. Curiosity. Pillar of salt, Wouldn't have it of course

because he didn't think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested

with a false stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like Plumtree's

potted under the obituaries, cold meat department. You can't lick 'em.

What? Our envelopes. Hello! Jones, where are you going? Can't stop, Robinson,

I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser <I>Kansell</I>,

sold by Hely's Ltd, 85 Dame Street. Well out of that ruck I am. Devil of

a job it was collecting accounts of those convents. Tranquilla convent.

That was a nice nun there, really sweet face. Wimple suited her small head.

Sister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes. Very hard

to bargain with that sort of woman. I disturbed her at her devotions that

morning. But glad to communicate with the outside world. Our great day,

she said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet name too: caramel. She

knew, I think she knew by the way she. If she had married she would have

changed. I suppose they really were short of money. Fried everything in

the best butter all the same. No lard for them. My heart's broke eating

dripping. They like buttering themselves in and out. Molly tasting it,

her veil up. Sister? Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker's daughter. It was a nun

they say invented barbed wire.



<P>He crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by. Rover

cycleshop. Those races are on today. How long ago is that? Year Phil Gilligan

died. We were in Lombard street west. Wait, was in Thom's. Got the job

in Wisdom Hely's year we married. Six years. Ten years ago: ninetyfour

he died, yes that's right, the big fire at Arnott's. Val Dillon was lord

mayor. The Glencree dinner. Alderman Robert O'Reilly emptying the port

into his soup before the flag fell, Bobbob lapping it for the inner alderman.

Couldn't hear what the band played. For what we have already received may

the Lord make us. Milly was a kiddy then. Molly had that elephantgrey dress

with the braided frogs. Mantailored with self-covered buttons. She didn't

like it because I sprained my ankle first day she wore choir picnic at

the Sugarloaf. As if that. Old Goodwin's tall hat done up with some sticky

stuff. Flies' picnic too. Never put a dress on her back like it. Fitted

her like a glove, shoulder and hips. Just beginning to plump it out well.

Rabbit pie we had that day. People looking after her.



<P>Happy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper,

Dockrell's, one and ninepence a dozen. Milly's tubbing night. American

soap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of her bathwater. Funny she looked

soaped all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa's daguerreotype

atelier he told me of. Hereditary taste.



<P>He walked along the curbstone.



<P>Stream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always

squinting in when he passed? Weak eyes, woman. Stopped in Citron's saint

Kevin's parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is getting. Pen...

? Of course it's years ago. Noise of the trams probably. Well, if he couldn't

remember the dayfather's name that he sees every day.



<P>Bartell d'Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home

after practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her that

song <I>Winds that blow from the south</I>.



<P>Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting

on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin's concert in the supper room

or oakroom of the mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of her music blew

out of my hand against the high school railings. Lucky it didn't. Thing

like that spoils the effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin linking

her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His farewell concerts. Positively

last appearance on any stage. May be for months and may be for never. Remember

her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar up. Corner of Harcourt road

remember that gust? Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered

old Goodwin. She did get flushed in the wind. Remember when we got home

raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her

supper with the Chutney sauce she liked. And the mulled rum. Could see

her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays. White.



<P>Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her.

Always liked to let herself out. Sitting there after till near two, taking

out her hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy. That was

the night.



<P>-- O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?



<P>-- Oh, how do you do, Mrs Breen?



<P>-- No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven't seen her for

ages.



<P>-- In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily, Milly has a position down in Mullingar,

you know.



<P>-- Go away! Isn't that grand for her?



<P>-- Yes, in a photographer's there. Getting on like a house on fire.

How are all your charges?



<P>-- All on the baker's list, Mrs Breen said.



<P>How many has she? No other in sight.



<P>-- You're in black I see. You have no...



<P>-- No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.



<P>Going to crop up all day, I foresee. Who's dead, when and what did he

die of? Turn up like a bad penny.



<P>-- o dear me, Mrs Breen said, I hope it wasn't any near relation.



<P>May as well get her sympathy.



<P>-- Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly,

poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Your funeral's tomorrow

<BR>While you're coming through the rye.

<BR>Diddlediddle dumdum

<BR>Diddlediddle...</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen's womaneyes said melancholily.



<P>Now that's quite enough about that. Just quietly: husband.



<P>-- And your lord and master?



<P>Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn't lost them anyhow.



<P>-- O, don't be talking, she said. He's a caution to rattlesnakes. He's

in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me

heartscalded. Wait till I show you.



<P>Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured

out from Harrison's. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom's gullet.

Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they'd

taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot arab stood over

the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.

Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork chained to the table.



<P>Opening her handbag, chipped leather, hatpin: ought to have a guard

on those things. Stick it in a chap's eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open.

Money. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain. Husband

barging. Where's the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are you feeding

your little brother's family? Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle. Pastile

that was fell. What is she?...



<P>-- There must be a new moon out, she said. He's always bad then. Do

you know what he did last night?



<P>Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him wide in

alarm, yet smiling.



<P>-- What? Mr Bloom asked.



<P>Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.



<P>-- Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.



<P>Indiges.



<P>-- Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.



<P>-- The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.



<P>She took a folded postcard from her handbag.



<P>-- Read that, she said. He got it this morning.



<P>-- What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.P.?



<P>-- U.P.: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It's a great

shame for them whoever he is.



<P>-- Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.



<P>She took back the card, sighing.



<P>-- And now he's going round to Mr Menton's office. He's going to take

an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.



<P>She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.



<P>Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen

its best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque, three

old grapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a

tasty dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than Molly.



<P>See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.



<P>He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.

Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I'm hungry too. Flakes of pastry

on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek. Rhubarb

tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie Powell that was.

In Luke Doyle's long ago, Dolphin's Barn, the charades. U.P.: up.



<P>Change the subject.



<P>-- Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy, Mr Bloom asked.



<P>-- Mina Purefoy? she said.



<P>Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers' club. Matcham often thinks

of the masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.



<P>-- Yes.



<P>-- I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. She's in the lying-in

hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She's three days bad now.



<P>-- O, Mr Bloom said. I'm sorry to hear that.



<P>-- Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home. It's a very

stiff birth, the nurse told me.



<P>-- O, Mr Bloom said.



<P>His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in compassion.

Dth! Dth!



<P>-- I'm sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That's terrible

for her.



<P>Mrs Breen nodded.



<P>-- She was taken bad on the Tuesday...



<P>Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her.



<P>-- Mind! Let this man pass.



<P>A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river, staring with

a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavy stringed glass. Tight as

a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat,

a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.



<P>-- Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts.

Watch!



<P>-- Who is he if it's a fair question, Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?



<P>-- His name is Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr

Bloom said, smiling. Watch!



<P>-- He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these

days.



<P>She broke off suddenly.



<P>-- There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me

to Molly, won't you?



<P>-- I will, Mr Bloom said.



<P>He watched her dodge through passers towards the shop-fronts. Denis

Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison's

hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay. Like old times.

He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey

beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.



<P>Meshuggah. Off his chump.



<P>Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the

tight skullpiece, the dangling stick, umbrella, dustcoat. Going the two

days. Watch him! Out he goes again. One way of getting on in the world.

And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds. Hard time she must have

with him.



<P>U.P.: up. I'll take my oath that's Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding. Wrote

it for a lark in the Scotch house, I bet anything. Round to Menton's office.

His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. Be a feast for the gods.



<P>He passed the <I>Irish Times</I>. There might be other answers lying

there. Like to answer them all. Good system for criminals. Code. At their

lunch now. Clerk with the glasses there doesn't know me. O, leave them

there to simmer. Enough bother wading through forty-four of them. Wanted

smart lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work. I called you naughty

darling because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is

the meaning. Please tell me what perfume does your wife. Tell me who made

the world. The way they spring those questions on you. And the other one

Lizzie Twigg. My literary efforts have had the good fortune to meet with

the approval of the eminent poet A. E. (Mr Geo Russell). No time to do

her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of poetry.



<P>Best paper by long chalks for a small ad. Got the provinces now. Cook

and general, exc cuisine, housemaid kept. Wanted live man for spirit counter.

Resp girl (R. C.) wishes to hear of post in fruit or pork shop. James Carlisle

made that. Six and a half percent dividend. Made a big deal on Coates's

shares. Ca'canny. Cunning old Scotch hunks. All the toady news. Our gracious

and popular vicereine. Bought the <I>Irish Field</I> now. Lady Mountcashel

has quite recovered after her confinement and rode out with the Ward Union

staghounds at the enlargement yesterday at Rathoath. Uneatable fox. Pothunters

too. Fear injects juices make it tender enough for them. Riding astride.

Sit her horse like a man. Weightcarrying huntress. No sidesaddle or pillion

for her, not for Joe. First to the meet and in at the death. Strong as

a brood mare some of those horsey women. Swagger around livery stables.

Toss off a glass of brandy neat while you'd say knife. That one at the

Grosvenor this morning. Up with her on the car: wishwish. Stonewall or

fivebarred gate put her mount to it. Think that pugnosed driver did it

out of spite. Who is this she was like? O yes? Mrs Miriam Dandrade that

sold me her old wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel. Divorced

Spanish American. Didn't take a feather out of her my handling them. As

if I was her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal party when Stubbs the

park ranger got me in with Whelan of the <I>Express</I>. Scavenging what

the quality left. High tea. Mayonnaise I poured on the plums thinking it

was custard. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few weeks after. Want

to be a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work for her, thanks.



<P>Poor Mrs Purefoy! Methodist husband. Method in his madness. Saffron

bun and milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy. Eating with a stopwatch,

thirtytwo chews to the minute. Still his muttonchop whiskers grew. Supposed

to be well connected. Theodore's cousin in Dublin Castle. One tony relative

in every family. Hardy annuals he presents her with. Saw him out at the

Three Jolly Topers marching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying

one in a marketnet. The squallers. Poor thing! Then having to give the

breast year after year all hours of the night. Selfish those t.t's are.

Dog in the manger. Only one lump of sugar in my tea, if you please.



<P>He stood at Fleet street crossing. Luncheon interval a sixpenny at Rowe's?

Must look up that ad in the national library. An eightpenny in the Burton.

Better. On my way.



<P>He walked on past Bolton's Westmoreland house. Tea. Tea. Tea. I forgot

to tap Tom Kernan.



<P>Sss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a vinegared

handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out! Phew! Dreadful

simply! Child's head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her trying to

butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out. Kill me that would.

Lucky Molly got over hers lightly. They ought to invent something to stop

that. Life with hard labour. Twilightsleep idea: queen Victoria was given

that. Nine she had. A good layer. Old woman that lived in a shoe she had

so many children. Suppose he was consumptive. Time someone thought about

it instead of gassing about the what was it the pensive bosom of the silver

effulgence. Flapdoodle to feed fools on. They could easily have big establishments.

Whole thing quite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five

quid at compound interest up to twentyone, five per cent is a hundred shillings

and five tiresome pounds, multiply by twenty decimal system, encourage

people to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years want

to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum, more than you think.



<P>Not stillborn of course. They are not even registered. Trouble for nothing.



<P>Funny sight two of them together, their bellies out. Molly and Mrs Moisel.

Mothers' meeting. Phthisis retires for the time being, then returns. How

flat they look after all of a sudden! Peaceful eyes. Weight off their minds.

Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. All my babies, she said. The spoon

of pap in her mouth before she fed them. O, that's nyumyum. Got her hand

crushed by old Tom Wall's son. His first bow to the public. Head like a

prize pumpkin. Snuffy Dr Murren. People knocking them up at all hours.

For God'sake doctor. Wife In her throes. Then keep them waiting months

for their fee. To attendance on your wife. No gratitude in people. Humane

doctors, most of them.



<P>Before the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of

pigeons flew. Their little frolic after meals. Who will we do it on? I

pick the fellow in black. Here goes. Here's good luck. Must be thrilling

from the air. Apjohn, myself and Owen Goldberg up in the trees near Goose

green playing the monkeys. Mackerel they called me.



<P>A squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian

file. Goose step. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their truncheons.

After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their belts. Policeman's

lot is oft a happy one. They split up into groups and scattered, saluting

towards their beats. Let out to graze. Best moment to attack one in pudding

time. A punch in his dinner. A squad of others, marching irregularly, rounded

Trinity railings, making for the station. Bound for their troughs. Prepare

to receive cavalry. Prepare to receive soup.



<P>He crossed under Tommy Moore's roguish finger. They did right to put

him up over a urinal: meeting of the waters. Ought to be places for women.

Running into cakeshops. Settle my hat straight. <I>There is not in this

wide world a vallee</I>. Great song of Julia Morkan's. Kept her voice up

to the very last. Pupil of Michael Balfe's wasn't she?



<P>He gazed after the last broad tunic. Nasty customers to tackle. Jack

Power could a tale unfold: father a G man. If a fellow gave them trouble

being lagged they let him have it hot and heavy in the bridewell. Can't

blame them after all with the job they have especially the young hornies.

That horse policeman the day Joe Chamberlain was given his degree in Trinity

he got a run for his money. My word he did! His horse's hoofs clattering

after us down Abbey street. Luck I had the presence of mind to dive into

Manning's or I was souped. He did come a wallop, by George. Must have cracked

his skull on the cobblestones. I oughtn't to have got myself swept along

with those medicals. And the Trinity jibs in their mortar-boards. Looking

for trouble. Still I got to know that young Dixon who dressed that sting

for me in the Mater and now he's in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy. Wheels

within wheels. Police whistle in my ears still. All skedaddled. Why he

fixed on me. Give me in charge. Right here it began.



<P>-- Up the Boers!



<P>-- Three cheers for De Wet!



<P>-- We'll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.



<P>Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Vinegar hill.

The Butter exchange band. Few years' time half of them magistrates and

civil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows

used to whether on the scaffold high.



<P>Never know who you're talking to. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff

in his eye. Like that Peter or Denis or James Carey that blew the gaff

on the invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on

to get in the know. All the time drawing secret service pay from the castle.

Drop him like a hot potato. Why those plain clothes men are always courting

slaveys. Easily twig a man used to uniform. Square-pushing up against a

backdoor. Maul her a bit. Then the next thing on the menu. And who is the

gentleman does be visiting there? Was the young master saying anything?

Peeping Tom through the keyhole. Decoy duck. Hotblooded young student fooling

round her fat arms ironing.



<P>-- Are those yours, Mary?



<P>-- I don't wear such things... Stop or I'll tell the missus on you.

Out half the night.



<P>-- There are great times coming, Mary. Wait till you see.



<P>-- Ah, get along with your great times coming. Barmaids too. Tobacco

shopgirls.



<P>James Stephens' idea was the best. He knew them. Circles of ten so that

a fellow couldn't round on more than his own ring. Sinn Fein. Back out

you get the knife. Hidden hand. Stay in, the firing squad. Turnkey's daughter

got him out of Richmond, off from Lusk. Putting up in the Buckingham Palace

hotel under their very noses. Garibaldi.



<P>You must have a certain fascination: Parnell, Arthur Griffith is a squareheaded

fellow but he has no go in him for the mob. Want to gas about our lovely

land. Gammon and spinach. Dublin Bakery Company's tearoom. Debating societies.

That republicanism is the best form of government. That the language question

should take precedence of the economic question. Have your daughters inveigling

them to your house. Stuff them up with meat and drink. Michaelmas goose.

Here's a good lump of thyme seasoning under the apron for you. Have another

quart of goosegrease before it gets too cold. Halffed enthusiasts. Penny

roll and a walk with the band. No grace for the carver. The thought that

the other chap pays best sauce in the world. Make themselves thoroughly

at home. Shove us over those apricots, meaning peaches. The not far distant

day. Home Rule sun rising up in the northwest.



<P>His smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly, shadowing

Trinity's surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing, outgoing, clanging.

Useless words. Things go on same; day after day: squads of police marching

out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies mooching about. Dignam carted

off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed groaning to have a child tugged

out of her. One born every second somewhere. Other dying every second.

Since I fed the birds five minutes. Three hundred kicked the bucket. Other

three hundred born, washing the blood off, all are washed in the blood

of the lamb, bawling maaaaaa.



<P>Cityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other

coming on, passing on. Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of pavements,

piledup bricks, stones. Changing hands. This owner, that. Landlord never

dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets his notice to quit.

They buy the place up with gold and still they have all the gold. Swindle

in it somewhere. Piled up in cities, worn away age after age. Pyramids

in sand. Built on bread and onions. Slaves. Chinese wall. Babylon. Big

stones left. Round towers. Rest rubble, sprawling suburbs, jerrybuilt,

Kerwan's mushroom houses, built of breeze. Shelter for the night.



<P>No one is anything.



<P>This is the very worst hour of the day. Vitality. Dull, gloomy: hate

this hour. Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.



<P>Provost's house. The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon. Well tinned

in there. Wouldn't live in it if they paid me. Hope they have liver and

bacon today. Nature abhors a vacuum.



<P>The sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the silver

ware in Walter Sexton's window opposite by which John Howard Parnell passed,

unseeing.



<P>There he is: the brother. Image of him. Haunting face. Now that's a

coincidence. Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don't meet

him. Like a man walking in his sleep. No-one knows him. Must be a corporation

meeting today. They say he never put on the city marshal's uniform since

he got the job. Charley Boulger used to come out on his high horse, cocked

hat, puffed, powdered and shaved. Look at the woebegone walk of him. Eaten

a bad egg. Poached eyes on ghost. I have a pain. Great man's brother: his

brother's brother. He'd look nice on the city charger. Drop into the D.

B. C. probably for his coffee, play chess there. His brother used men as

pawns. Let them all go to pot. Afraid to pass a remark on him. Freeze them

up with that eye of his. That's the fascination: the name. All a bit touched.

Mad Fanny and his other sister Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet

harness. Bolt upright like surgeon M'Ardle. Still David Sheehy beat him

for south Meath. Apply for the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public

life. The patriot's banquet. Eating orangepeels in the park. Simon Dedalus

said when they put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from

the grave and lead him out of the House of Commons by the arm.



<P>Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which

the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks with

a Scotch accent. The tentacles...



<P>They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone. Beard and bicycle.

Young woman.



<P>And there he is too. Now that's really a coincidence: second-time. Coming

events cast their shadows before. With the approval of the eminent poet

Mr Geo Russell. That might be Lizzie Twigg with him. A. E.: what does that

mean? Initials perhaps. Albert Edward, Arthur Edmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El

Esquire. What was he saying? The ends of the world with a Scotch accent.

Tentacles: octopus. Something occult: symbolism. Holding forth. She's taking

it all in. Not saying a word. To aid gentleman in literary work.



<P>His eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle, a

listening woman at his side. Coming from the vegetarian. Only weggebobbles

and fruit. Don't eat a beefsteak. If you do the eyes of that cow will pursue

you through all eternity. They say it's healthier. Wind and watery though.

Tried it. Keep you on the run all day. Bad as a bloater. Dreams all night.

Why do they call that thing they gave me nutsteak? Nutarians. Fruitarians.

To give you the idea you are eating rumpsteak. Absurd. Salty too. They

cook in soda. Keep you sitting by the tap all night.



<P>Her stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that: so tasteless,

Those literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy, symbolistic.

Esthetes they are. I wouldn't be surprised if it was that kind of food

you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical. For example

one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts; you couldn't

squeeze a line of poetry out of him. Don't know what poetry is even. Must

be in a certain mood.

<BLOCKQUOTE>The dreamy cloudy gull

<BR>Waves o'er the waters dull.</BLOCKQUOTE>

He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of Yeates

and Son, pricing the field glasses. Or will I drop into old Harris's and

have a chat with young Sinclair? Well-mannered fellow. Probably at his

lunch. Must get those old glasses of mine set right. G<oe>rz lenses, six

guineas. Germans making their way everywhere. Sell on easy terms to capture

trade. Undercutting. Might chance on a pair in the railway lost property

office. Astonishing the things people leave behind them in trains and cloak

rooms. What do they be thinking about? Women too. Incredible. Last year

travelling to Ennis had to pick up that farmer's daughter's bag and hand

it to her at Limerick junction. Unclaimed money too. There's a little watch

up there on the roof of the bank to test those glasses by.



<P>His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides. Can't see it. If

you imagine it's there you can almost see it. Can't see it.



<P>He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right

hand at arm's length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes: completely.

The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun's disk. Must be the focus

where the rays cross. If I had black glasses. Interesting. There was a

lot of talk about those sunspots when we were in Lombard street west. Terrific

explosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn some

time.



<P>Now that I come to think of it, that ball falls at Greenwich time. It's

the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out there

some first Saturday of the month. If I could get art introduction to professor

Joly or learn up something about his family. That would do to: man always

feels complimented. Flattery where least expected. Nobleman proud to be

descended from some king's mistress. His foremother. Lay it on with a trowel.

Cap in hand goes through the land. Not go in and blurt out what you know

you're not to: what's parallax? Show this gentleman the door.



<P>Ah.



<P>His hand fell again to his side.



<P>Never know anything about it. Waste of time. Gasballs spinning about,

crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas, then solid,

then world, then cold, then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock like

that pineapple rock. The moon. Must be a new moon, she said. I believe

there is.



<P>He went on by la Maison Claire.



<P>Wait. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly there

is a new moon. Walking down by the Tolka. Not bad for a Fairview moon.

She was humming: The young May moon she's beaming, love. He other side

of her. Elbow, arm. He. Glowworm's la-amp is gleaming, love. Touch. Fingers.

Asking. Answer. Yes.



<P>Stop. Stop. If it was it was. Must.



<P>Mr Bloom, quick breathing, slowlier walking, passed Adam court.



<P>With a keep quiet relief, his eyes took note: this is street here middle

of the day Bob Doran's bottle shoulders. On his annual bend, M'Coy said.

They drink in order to say or do something or <I>cherchez la femme</I>.

Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the rest of the

year as sober as a judge.



<P>Yes. Thought so. Sloping into the Empire. Gone. Plain soda would do

him good. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the

Queen's. Broth of a boy. Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon

face in a poky bonnet. Three Purty Maids from School. How time flies eh?

Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts. Drinkers, drinking, laughed

spluttering, their drink against their breath. More power, Pat. Coarse

red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke. Take off that white hat. His

parboiled eyes. Where is he now? Beggar somewhere. The harp that once did

starve us all.



<P>I was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twenty-eight I was.

She twentythree when we left Lombard street west something changed. Could

never like it again after Rudy. Can't bring back time. Like holding water

in your hand. Would you go back to then? Just beginning then. Would you?

Are you not happy in your home, you poor little naughty boy? Wants to sew

on buttons for me. I must answer. Write it in the library.



<P>Grafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses. Muslin prints,

silk, dames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in

the baking causeway. Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings.

Hope the rain mucks them up on her. Country bred chawbacon. All the beef

to the heels were in. Always gives a woman clumsy feet. Molly looks out

of plumb.



<P>He passed, dallying, the windows of Brown Thomas, silk mercers. Cascades

of ribbons. Flimsy China silks. A tilted urn poured from its mouth a flood

of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood. The huguenots brought that here. <I>La

causa &egrave; santa!</I> Tara tara. Great chorus that. Tara. Must be washed

in rainwater. Meyerbeer. Tara: bom bom bom.



<P>Pincushions. I'm a long time threatening to buy one. Stick them all

over the place. Needles in window curtains.



<P>He bared slightly his left forearm. Scrape: nearly gone. Not today anyhow.

Must go back for that lotion. For her birthday perhaps. Junejulyaugseptember

eighth. Nearly three months off. Then she mightn't like it. Women won't

pick up pins. Say it cuts lo.



<P>Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk stockings.



<P>Useless to go back. Had to be. Tell me all.



<P>High voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home

and houses, silk webs, silver, rich fruits, spicy from Jaffa. Agendath

Netaim. Wealth of the world.



<P>A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded.

Perfume of embraces all him assailed. With hungered flesh obscurely, he

mutely craved to adore.



<P>Duke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.



<P>He turned Combridge's corner, still pursued. Jingling hoofthuds. Perfumed

bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: In deep summer fields, tangled

pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas, creaking

beds.



<P>-- Jack, love!



<P>-- Darling!



<P>-- Kiss me, Reggy!



<P>-- My boy!



<P>-- Love!



<P>His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. Stink

gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slop of greens. See the

animals feed.



<P>Men, men, men.



<P>Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables calling

for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food, their

eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A pallid suetfaced young man polished

his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin. New set of microbes.

A man with an infant's saucestained napkin tucked round him shovelled gurgling

soup down his gullet. A man spitting back on his plate: halfmasticated

gristle: no teeth to chewchewchew it. Chump chop from the grill. Bolting

to get it over. Sad booser's eyes. Bitten off more than he can chew. Am

I like that? See ourselves as others see us. Hungry man is an angry man.

Working tooth and jaw. Don't! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland

Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne.

Wonder what he was eating. Something galoptious. Saint Patrick converted

him to Christianity. Couldn't swallow it all however.



<P>-- Roast beef and cabbage.



<P>-- One stew.



<P>Smells of men. His gorge rose. Spaton sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarette

smoke, reek of plug, spilt beer, men's beery piss, the stale of ferment.



<P>Couldn't eat a morsel here. Fellow sharpening knife and fork, to eat

all before him, old chap picking his tootles. Slight spasm, full, chewing

the cud. Before and after. Grace after meals. Look on this picture then

on that. Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it off

the plate, man! Get out of this.



<P>He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of

his nose.



<P>-- Two stouts here.



<P>-- One corned and cabbage.



<P>That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended

on it. Good stroke. Give me the fidgets to look. Safer to eat from his

three hands. Tear it limb from limb. Second nature to him. Born with a

silver knife in his mouth. That's witty, I think. Or no. Silver means born

rich. Born with a knife. But then the allusion is lost.



<P>An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. Rock, the bailiff,

standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard. Well up: it

splashed yellow near his boot. A diner, knife and fork upright, elbows

on table, ready for a second helping stared towards the foodlift across

his stained square of newspaper. Other chap telling him something with

his mouth full. Sympathetic listener. Table talk. I munched hum un thu

Unchster Bunk un Munchday. Ha? Did you, faith?



<P>Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said.



<P>-- Not here. Don't see him.



<P>Out. I hate dirty eaters.



<P>He backed towards the door. Get a light snack in Davy Byrne's. Stopgap.

Keep me going. Had a good breakfast.



<P>-- Roast and mashed here.



<P>-- Pint of stout.



<P>Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp. Grub. Gulp. Gobstuff.



<P>He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street.

Eat or be eaten. Kill! Kill!



<P>Suppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting down

with porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the street.

John Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every mother's son don't

talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity women and children, cabmen,

priests, parsons, fieldmarshals, archbishops. From Ailesbury road, Clyde

road, artisans' dwellings, north Dublin union, lord ma in his gingerbread

coach, old queen in a bathchair. My plate's empty. After you with our incorporated

drinkingcup. Like sir Philip Crampton's fountain. Rub off the microbes

with your handkerchief. Next chap rubs on a new batch with his. Father

O'Flynn would make hares of them all. Have rows all the same. All for number

one. Children fighting for the scrapings of the pot. Want a soup pot as

big as the Phoenix Park. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of it.

Hate people all round you. City Arms hotel <I>table d'h&ocirc;te</I> she

called it. Soup, joint and sweet. Never know whose thoughts you're chewing.

Then who'd wash up all the plates and forks? Might be all feeding on tabloids

that time. Teeth getting worse and worse.



<P>After all there's a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from

the earth garlic, of course, it stinks Italian organgrinders crisp of onions,

mushrooms truffles. Pain to animal too. Pluck and draw fowl. Wretched brutes

there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe to split their skulls

open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering bob. Bubble and squeak.

Butchers' buckets wobble lights. Give us that brisket off the hook. Plup.

Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed sheep hung from their haunches,

sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling nosejam on sawdust. Top and lashers

going out. Don't maul them pieces, young one.



<P>Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed. Insidious.

Lick it up, smoking hot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.



<P>Ah, I'm hungry.



<P>He entered Davy Byrne's. Moral pub. He doesn't chat. Stands a drink

now and then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.



<P>What will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?



<P>-- Hellow, Bloom! Nosey Flynn said from his nook.



<P>-- Hello, Flynn.



<P>-- How's things?



<P>-- Tiptop... Let me see. I'll take a glass of burgundy and... let me

see.



<P>Sardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham

and his descendants mustered and bred there. Potted meats. What is home

without Plumtree's potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad! Under the

obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree Dignam's potted meat.

Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too salty. Like pickled

pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of honour. Ought to be tough

from exercise. His wives in a row to watch the effect. <I>There was a right

royal old nigger. Who ate or something the somethings of the reverend Mr

MacTrigger</I>. With it an abode of bliss. Lord knows what concoction.

Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked and minced up. Puzzle find the meat.

Kosher. No meat and milk together. Hygiene that was what they call now.

Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of inside. Peace and war depend on some

fellow's digestion. Religions. Christmas turkeys and geese. Slaughter of

innocents. Eat, drink and be merry. Then casual wards full after. Heads

bandaged. Cheese digests all but itself. Mighty cheese.



<P>-- Have you a cheese sandwich?



<P>-- Yes, sir.



<P>Like a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass

of burgundy; take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber.

Tom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served

me that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God made

food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.



<P>-- Wife well?



<P>-- Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?



<P>-- Yes, sir.



<P>Nosey Flynn sipped his grog.



<P>-- Doing any singing those times?



<P>Look at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match.

Music. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him. Does

no harm. Free ad.



<P>-- She's engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard

perhaps.



<P>-- No. O, that's the style. Who's getting it up?



<P>The curate served.



<P>-- How much is that?



<P>-- Seven d., sir... Thank you, sir.



<P>Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. <I>Mr MacTrier</I>. Easier

than the dreamy creamy stuff. His <I>five hundred wives. Had the time of

their lives</I>.



<P>-- Mustard, sir?



<P>-- Thank you.



<P>He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. <I>Their lives</I>.

I have it. <I>It grew bigger and bigger and bigger</I>.



<P>-- Getting it up? he said. Well, it's like a company idea, you see.

Part shares and part profits.



<P>-- Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket

to scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn't Blazes Boylan mixed

up in it?



<P>A warm shock of air heat of mustard hauched on Mr Bloom's heart. He

raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock five

minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.



<P>His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly,

longingly.



<P>Wine.



<P>He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to

speed it, set his wineglass delicately down.



<P>-- Yes, he said. He's the organiser in point of fact.



<P>No fear. No brains.



<P>Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.



<P>-- He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that

boxing match Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello barracks.

By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he was telling

me...



<P>Hope that dewdrop doesn't come down into his glass. No, snuffled it

up.



<P>-- For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God

till further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is

a hairy chap.



<P>Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves,

cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring's blush. Whose

smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat

on the parsnips.



<P>-- And here's himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give

us a good one for the Gold cup?



<P>-- I'm off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything

on a horse.



<P>-- You're right there, Nosey Flynn said.



<P>Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish

of disgust, pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of

his wine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather

with the chill off.



<P>Nice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like

the way it curves there.



<P>-- I wouldn't do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined

many a man the same horses.



<P>Vintners' sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits

for consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.



<P>-- True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you're in the know. There's

no straight sport now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He's giving Sceptre

today. Zinfandel's the favourite, lord Howard de Walden's, won at Epsom.

Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one against Saint

Amant a fortnight before.



<P>-- That so? Davy Byrne said...



<P>He went towards the window and, taking up the petty cash book, scanned

its pages.



<P>-- I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said snuffling. That was a rare bit of

horseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm, Rothschild's

filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow cap. Bad luck to

big Ben Dollard and his John O'Gaunt. He put me off it. Ay.



<P>He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes.



<P>-- Ay, he said, sighing.



<P>Mr Bloom, champing standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numskull. Will

I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him forget.

Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down again. Cold nose

he'd have kissing a woman. Still they might like. Prickly beards they like.

Dog's cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the rumbling stomach's Skye terrier

in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling him in her lap. O the big doggy-bowwowsywowsy!



<P>Wine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish

cheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I'm not thirsty. Bath

of course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o'clock I can.

Six, six. Time will be gone then. She...



<P>Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so off

colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins, sardines, gaudy lobsters'

claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of shells, periwinkles

with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the French eat, out of

the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn nothing in a thousand years.

If you didn't know risky putting anything into your mouth. Poisonous berries.

Johnny Magories. Roundness you think good. Gaudy colour warns you off.

One fellow told another and so on. Try it on the dog first. Led on by the

smell or the look. Tempting fruit. Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves

for instance. Need artificial irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what

about oysters? Unsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to

open them too. Who found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and

Red bank oysters. Effect on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red bank

this morning. Was he oyster old fish at table. Perhaps he young flesh in

bed. No. June has no ar no oysters. But there are people like tainted game.

Jugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs fifty years old,

blue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each dish harmless might

mix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That archduke Leopold was it? No.

Yes, or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs? Or who was it used to eat the

scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch in town. Of course, aristocrats.

Then the others copy to be in the fashion. Milly too rock oil and flour.

Raw pastry I like myself. Half the catch of oysters they throw back in

the sea to keep up the price. Cheap. No one would buy. Caviare. Do the

grand. Hock in green glasses. Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom

pearls. The <I>&eacute;lite. Cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me</I>. They

want special dishes to pretend they're. Hermit with a platter of pulse

keep down the stings of the flesh. Know me come eat with me. Royal sturgeon.

High sheriff, Coffey, the butcher, right to venisons of the forest from

his ex. Send him back the half of a cow. Spread I saw down in the Master

of the Rolls' kitchen area. Whitehatted <I>chef</I> like a rabbi. Combustible

duck. Curly cabbage <I>&agrave; la duchesse de Parme</I>. Just as well

to write it on the bill of fare so you can know what you've eaten too many

drugs spoil the broth. I know it myself. Dosing it with Edwards' desiccated

soup. Geese stuffed silly for them. Lobsters boiled alive: Do ptake some

ptarmigan. Wouldn't mind being a waiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening

dress, halfnaked ladies. May I tempt you to a little more filleted lemon

sole, miss Dubedat? Yes, do bedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect

that. A miss Dubedat lived in Killiney I remember. <I>Du, de la</I>, French.

Still it's the same fish, perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped

the guts out of making money, hand over fist, finger in fishes' gills,

can't write his name on a cheque, think he was painting the landscape with

his mouth twisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha. Ignorant as a kish of brogues,

worth fifty thousand pounds.



<P>Stuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.



<P>Glowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the winepress

grapes of Burgundy. Sun's heat it is. Seems to a secret touch telling me

memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under wild ferns

on Howth. Below us bay sleeping sky. No sound. The sky. The bay purple

by the Lion's head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards Sutton. Fields

of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities. Pillowed on

my coat she had her hair, earwigs In the heather scrub my hand under her

nape, you'll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched

me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away. Ravished over her I lay,

full lips full open, kissed her mouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth

the seedcake warm and chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweet

and sour with spittle. Joy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave

me pouting. Soft, warm, sticky grumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take

me, willing eyes. Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on

Ben Howth rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants.

Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her, kissed

her; eyes, her lips, her stretched neck, beating, woman s breasts full

in her blouse of nun's veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her.

She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she

kissed me.



<P>Me. And me now.



<P>Stuck, the flies buzzed.



<P>His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab. Beauty:

it curves, curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the

world admires. Can see them library museum standing in the round hall,

naked goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don't care what man looks. All

to see. Never speaking, I mean to say to fellows like Flynn. Suppose she

did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first? Mortal! Put you in

your proper place. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods, golden dishes, all

ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and

turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar, imagine it drinking electricity: gods'

food. Lovely forms of woman sculped Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing

food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food:

have to feed it like stoking an engine. They have no. Never looked. I'll

look today. Keeper won't see. Bend down let something fall see if she.



<P>Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do

there to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked,

to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers,

a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.



<P>When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:



<P>-- What is this he is? Isn't he in the insurance line?



<P>-- He's out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for

the <I>Freeman</I>.



<P>-- I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?



<P>-- Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?



<P>-- I noticed he was in mourning.



<P>-- Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all

at home. You're right, by God. So he was.



<P>-- I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a

gentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their minds.



<P>-- It's not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before

yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan's

wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home

to his better half. She's well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.



<P>-- And is he doing for the <I>Freeman?</I> Davy Byrne said.



<P>Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.



<P>-- He doesn't buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of

that.



<P>-- How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.



<P>Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He winked.



<P>-- He's in the craft, he said.



<P>-- Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.



<P>-- Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order.

Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg up. I was told that by

a, well, I won't say who.



<P>-- Is that a fact?



<P>-- O, it's a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you're

down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it, but they're as close as

damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.



<P>Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:



<P>-- Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!



<P>-- There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to

find out what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and

swore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the Saint Legers

of Doneraile.



<P>Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:



<P>-- And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here

and I never once saw him, you know, over the line.



<P>-- God Almighty couldn't make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips

off when the fun gets too hot. Didn't you see him look at his watch? Ah,

you weren't there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he

outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he does.



<P>-- There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He's a safe man, I'd say.



<P>-- He's not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He has been

known to put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due.

O, Bloom has his good points. But there's one thing he'll never do.



<P>His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.



<P>-- I know, Davy Byrne said.



<P>-- Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.



<P>Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came In. Tom Rochford followed, a plaining

hand on his claret waistcoat.



<P>-- Day, Mr Byrne.



<P>-- Day, gentlemen.



<P>They paused at the counter.



<P>-- Who's standing? Paddy Leonard asked.



<P>-- I'm sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.



<P>-- Well, what'll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.



<P>-- I'll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.



<P>-- How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God's sake? What's

yours, Tom?



<P>-- How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.



<P>For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.



<P>-- Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.



<P>-- Certainly, sir.



<P>Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.



<P>-- Lord love a duck, he said, look at what I'm standing drinks to! Cold

water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.

He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.



<P>-- Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.



<P>Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before

him.



<P>-- That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.



<P>-- Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.



<P>Tom Rochford nodded and drank.



<P>-- Is it Zinfandel?



<P>-- Say nothing, Bantam Lyons winked. I'm going to plunge five bob on

my own.



<P>-- Tell us if you're worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard

said. Who gave it to you?



<P>Mr Bloom on his way Out raised three fingers in greeting.



<P>-- So long, Nosey Flynn said.



<P>The others turned.



<P>-- That's the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.



<P>-- Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we'll take

two of your small Jamesons after that and a...



<P>-- Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.



<P>-- Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.



<P>Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth

smooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach say. Then with those

R&ouml;ntgen rays searchlight you could.



<P>At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the

cobble stones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks

having fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom

coasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they move.

Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his. Wasting

time explaining it to Flynn's mouth. Lean people long mouths. Ought to

be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free. Course

then you'd have all the cranks pestering.



<P>He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo, the closes of the bars:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Don Giovanni, a cenar teco

<BR>M'invitasti.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Feel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap

in the blues. Dutch courage. That <I>Kilkenny People</I> in the national

library now I must.



<P>Bare clean closestools, waiting, in the window of William Miller, plumber,

turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow

a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body,

changing biliary duct, spleen squirting liver, gastric juice coils of intestines

like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his

insides entrails on show. Science.



<P>-- <I>A cenar teco</I>.



<P>What does that <I>teco</I> mean? Tonight perhaps.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited

<BR>To come to supper tonight,

<BR>The rum the rumdum.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Doesn't go properly.



<P>Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That'll be two pounds ten, about

two pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Presscott's ad. Two

fifteen. Five guineas about. On the pig's back.



<P>Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new

garters.



<P>Today. Today. Not think.



<P>Tour the south then. What about English watering places? Brighton, Margate.

Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely seaside girls.

Against John Long's a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing

a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages. Will eat anything.



<P>Mr Bloom turned at Gray's confectioner's window of unbought tarts and

passed the reverend Thomas Connellan's bookstore. Why <I>I left the church

of Rome? Bird's Nest</I>. Women run him. They say they used to give pauper

children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.

Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews. Same

bait. Why we left the church of Rome?



<P>A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane.

No tram in sight. Wants to cross.



<P>-- Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.



<P>The blind stripling did not answer. His wall face frowned weakly. He

moved his head uncertainly.



<P>-- You're in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite.

Do you want to cross? There's nothing in the way.



<P>The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom's eye followed its

line and saw again the dyeworks' van drawn up before Drago's. Where I saw

his brilliantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in John

Long's. Slaking his drouth.



<P>-- There's a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it's not moving. I'll see

you across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?



<P>-- Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.



<P>-- Come, Mr Bloom said.



<P>He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to

guide it forward.



<P>Say something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust

what you tell them. Pass a common remark:



<P>-- The rain kept off.



<P>No answer.



<P>Stains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different

for him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child's hand his hand. Like

Milly's was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder if

he has a name, Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse's legs tired drudge

get his doze. That's right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a horse.



<P>-- Thanks, sir.



<P>Knows I'm a man. Voice.



<P>-- Right now? First turn to the left.



<P>The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing

his cane back, feeling again.



<P>Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone

tweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?

Must have felt it. See things in their foreheads perhaps. Kind of sense

of volume. Weight. Would he feel it if something was removed? Feel a gap.

Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.

Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn't that cane? Bloodless pious face

like a fellow going in to be a priest.



<P>Penrose! That was that chap's name.



<P>Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers.

Tune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a deformed

person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say. Of course

the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People ought to help.

Work basket I could buy Molly's birthday. Hates sewing. Might take an objection.

Dark men they call them.



<P>Sense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides bunched together.

Each person too. Then the spring, the summer: smells. Tastes. They say

you can't taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke

in the dark they say get no pleasure.



<P>And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl

passing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have them

all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his mind's eye.

The voice temperature when he touches her with fingers must almost see

the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair, for instance. Say it was

black for instance. Good. We call it black. Then passing over her white

skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of white.



<P>Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two shillings

half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer's just here too. Wait.

Think over it.



<P>With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above

his ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt

the skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough. The

belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick street.

Perhaps to Levenston's dancing academy piano. Might be settling my braces.



<P>Walking by Doran's public house he slid his hand between waistcoat and

trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his

belly. But I know it's whiteyellow. Want to try in the dark to see.



<P>He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.



<P>Poor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would

he have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being born

that way? All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned

in New York. Holocaust. Karma they call that transmigration for sins you

did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike-hoses. Dear, dear, dear.

Pity of course: but somehow you can't cotton on to them someway.



<P>Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons' hall. Solemn as Troy.

After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. Old legal cronies cracking a

magnum. Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school.

I sentenced him to ten years. I suppose he'd turn up his nose at that stuff

I drank. Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle. Has

his own ideas of justice in the recorder's court. Wellmeaning old man.

Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing

crime. Sends them to the rightabout. The devil on moneylenders. Gave Reuben

J. a great strawcalling. Now he's really what they call a dirty jew. Power

those judges have. Crusty old topers in wigs. Bear with a sore paw. And

may the Lord have mercy on your soul.



<P>Hello, placard. Mirus bazaar. His excellency the lord lieutenant. Sixteenth

today it is. In aid of funds for Mercer's hospital. <I>The Messiah</I>

was first given for that. Yes Handel. What about going out there. Ballsbridge.

Drop in on Keyes. No use sticking to him like a leech. Wear out my welcome.

Sure to know someone on the gate.



<P>Mr Bloom came to Kildare Street. First I must. Library.



<P>Straw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.



<P>His heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved

to the right.



<P>Is it? Almost certain. Won't look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too heady.

Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Not see. Get on.



<P>Making for the museum gate with long windy strides he lifted his eyes.

Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?



<P>Didn't see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.



<P>The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold statues:

quiet there. Safe in a minute.



<P>No, didn't see me. After two. Just at the gate.



<P>My heart!



<P>His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir Thomas

Deane was the Greek architecture.



<P>Look for something I.



<P>His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded Agendath

Netaim. Where did I?



<P>Busy looking for.



<P>He thrust back quickly Agendath.



<P>Afternoon she said.



<P>I am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. <I>Freeman</I>.

Where did I ? Ah, yes. Trousers. Purse. Potato. Where did I ?



<P>Hurry. Walk quietly. Moment more. My heart.

YES BECAUSE HE NEVER DID A THING LIKE THAT BEFORE AS ASK To get his breakfast

in bed with a couple of eggs since the <I>City arms</I> hotel when he used

to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to

make himself interesting to that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought

he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for

herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out

4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much

old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world

let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were

her sort down on bathing-suits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her

to wear I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice

I hope I'll never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces

but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr

Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of

her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats

especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that

and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always

if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better

for them go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id

have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital

nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him

out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im

not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a

woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that

dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the

choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack

bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of

the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids

voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy

face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown

in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when

he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get blood poisoning

but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course

the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere

Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking

of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he

was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning

it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and

who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married

flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him

when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence

to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled

eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only

for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some

little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly

if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday

he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room for

the matches to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told

me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking

about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she

has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially

getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of

him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to

hide it not that I care two straws who he does it with or knew before that

way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under

my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace

padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell

of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting

him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that

one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water I woman

is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants

then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas if you please

O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6

per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was

but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out

a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her

aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting

me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them

the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough

for me a little bit too much I saw too that her face swelled up on her

with temper when I gave her her weeks notice better do without them altogether

do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing

out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house

I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar

and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the

place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because

he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere

and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave

my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals

another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze

back singing the young May Moon shes beaming love because he has an idea

about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to

the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case

God knows hes change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same

old hat unless] paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself

a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we

were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking

at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing

that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would

you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I

would because I told him about some Dean or Bishop was sitting beside me

in the jews Temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger

to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired

me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is

in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his

name who tell me who the German Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think

of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will

he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for

any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till ( he comes

and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow

its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people

make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and

think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying

him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all

over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me

sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss

long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession

when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm

if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts

on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high

up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out

and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever

way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father

what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had

a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither

would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know

me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never

turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost

for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them

Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense

off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married

hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a

penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping

me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not

a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his father I wonder

is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower

he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or

perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liquor

Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those

stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted one with my finger

dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father

he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last

time we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because

I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment

I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up as if the world

was coming to an end God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming

down about us to punish when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like

those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar and they come and tell you theres

no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only

make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars

street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff

if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your

soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what

it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp yes because he must have come

3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought

the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though

his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down

after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some

kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters

I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my

life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must

have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with

a big hole in the middle of us like a Stallion driving it up into you because

thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his

eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of

spunk in him when I made him pull it out and do it on me considering how

big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly

the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women

for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it

themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe

cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of

your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular

as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called

budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack

the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling

over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ear supposed to be healthy

not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know

what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was

married I m sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has

more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie

Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well

he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were

spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out

with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted

to ram it down my neck on account of not liking to see her a wallflower

that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when

he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course

a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after

for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist

he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still

he knows a lot of mixed up things especially about the body and the insides

I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family

physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded

and watch him after that I pretended I had on a coolness with her over

him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who

are you going to and I aid over to Floey and he made me the present of

lord Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I

could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing

he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know

if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down

the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out

1 kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well seen then

let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend

shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her

and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt

fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration with his plabbery

kind of a manner to her like he did to me though I had the devils own job

to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold

in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too

the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something

I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper

with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much

the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more

than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever

he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed

up and down as far as possible asking me did you wash possible the women

are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know

by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come

out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the

least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord

Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a

little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much

the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about

all my hairpins falling one after another with the mass of hair I had youre

always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she

knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on

between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt

my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder

what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she

had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her

she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment

she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about

him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used

to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine

having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any

moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyway

whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet

or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his

hat when he comes up in the street like that and now hes going about in

his slippers to look for #10000 for a postcard up up O Sweetheart May wouldnt

a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid

even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id

rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of course hed

never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me

come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart

take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love

with some other man yet it was found out on her wasnt she the downright

villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully

aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do

they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because

they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper

wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from

the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in

love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt

care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes

enough to go and hang a woman surely are they



<P>theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he

noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with

Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered

2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids

of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care

with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy

takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with

some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede

gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman

and he wanted me to put it in the Irish Times lost in the ladies lavatory

D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes

on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked

back and I went there for tea 2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now

how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the

other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand

is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice

aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot

so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins

botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the

house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my

stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street well and another time

it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could

find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what

did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what

does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress

edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy

thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when

I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell dArcy too that he used

to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I

sang Gounods <I>Ave Maria</I> what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me

straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot

for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if

you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said

wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything

so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise

him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it

so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without

him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise

hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself

anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the

evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove

and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to inquire

the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think

of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject

of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced

things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even

when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the

cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom

she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before

he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with

a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off

his complexion-and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he

doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like

from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions

but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him

coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping

away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I half turned

and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly

watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything

for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed

time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in

his waistcoat pocket O <I>Maria santissima</I> he did look a big fool dreeping

in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them

and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with sunray pleats

that there was nobody he Said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering

he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd

take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I

lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner

after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public

I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly

all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out

if it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say

I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver

then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have

the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after

when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course

he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henry Doyle

he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky

man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake

dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used

to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with

that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young

then writing a letter every morning sometimes twice a day I liked the way

he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8

big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote the night he kissed my

heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like

nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope

hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who

come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its

somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen

blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard

street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old

stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was

a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody

to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy

today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches

first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying

to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have

been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls

coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never

seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny

to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there

is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered

myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well

he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant

if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any

fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother

me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with

a cough knocking on the wall then he wouldnt believe next day we didnt

do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after

me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its

better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him

the time going to the Mallow Concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup

for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with

the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and

the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion

for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two

gentlemen in the 3rd class Carriage said he was quite right so he was too

hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job

he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken

us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting

in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a 1st

class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well

O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their

eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man

that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to

Howth Id like to find out something about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then

you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose

I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on

on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when

was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now

singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the

army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for lord

Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it

him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to

sing in the <I>Stabat Mater</I> by going around saying he was putting Lead

Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he

was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old

opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or

whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says

that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming

man Griffith is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it

must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of politics

after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner

Lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely

fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave

too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock

my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be

seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt

they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the

rest of the old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging

on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if

he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment

pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it

was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of

the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the Black

Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince

of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that

won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry

well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave theyve

lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball

like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting

going around with him shopping buying those things in a new city better

leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over

the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers

or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go

and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and

hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could

find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked

close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression

besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones

hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down

for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky

told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue

as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating either

can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue

suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on

them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy

watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back

with the stop press tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because

he lost 20 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he

put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits

that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming

back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor

looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed

him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could

have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty

and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything

on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish

I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was

playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant

for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy

cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world

is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other

good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he

likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar

never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her

Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second

pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have

brought them back to Lewers this morning and kick up a row and made that

one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into

him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id

want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips

he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a

delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across

the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock

off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent

from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they

call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle

of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to

drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a

few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo

it thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the

violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got

on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday

that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made

up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after

all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only

have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax

and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin

underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the

burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs

about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going

in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style

I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing

if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes how

much were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and

jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting up

this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women

try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things

getting dearer every day for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no

Im what am I at all Ill be 33 in September will I what O well look at that

Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week

her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair

on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in

Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing

it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the

day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the Jersey Lily the prince of Wales

was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only

for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id

like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about

the jealous old husband what was it all and an oyster knife he went no

he made her wear a kind of a tin thing around her and the prince of Wales

yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of

those books he brings me the works of Master Francois somebody supposed

to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell

out a nice word for any priest to write and her a-e as if any fool wouldnt

know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with the old

blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and

Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 50

the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate

sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he

drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like

the infant Jesus In the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure

no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first

it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she

wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H. R. H. he was

in Gibraltar the year I gas born I bet he found lilies there too where

he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have

planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am

he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks

out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay

or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all

the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir

with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe

like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about

for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for

what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him

promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice

first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I

felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out

of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought

it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed

my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like

the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get

on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great

lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour

off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put

on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a wedding

cake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one

coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shop girl in that

place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she

as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving

you too much trouble whats she there for but I stared it out of her yes

he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked

Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very

hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of

him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me

without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and

me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was

out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you

were



<P>yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long

be made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow

stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and

Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what

are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same in case

of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those

statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are

they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his

two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up

at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf the woman

is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture

naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys

and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would

I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger

or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has the nymphs

used they go about like that I asked him that disgusting Cameron highlander

behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the

tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending

he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to

one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved

them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed

outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try

some fellow or other trying to catch my eye or if it was 1 of the 7 wonders

of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home

with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you

feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting cold I couldnt

keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after

a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the

mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up

like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting

a kick or a bang or something there and that word met something with hoses

in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never

can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and

burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much

theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I

had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast

of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I

could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning

that delicate looking student that stopped in No 28 with the Citrons Penrose

nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel

to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till

he got doctor Brady to give me the Belladonna prescription I had to get

him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than

cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything

I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember

the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master

Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them

Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want

everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman

I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here

or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire

inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the 2nd time tickling

me behind with his finger I was coming for about 5 minutes with my legs

round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts

of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those

lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your

way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you

to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk

I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and

my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one

Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday



<P>frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines

have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of

them all sides like the end of Loves old sweet synnnng the poor men that

have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting

engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans

and Photo bits leaving things like that lying around hes getting very careless

and threw the rest of them up in the W C Ill get him to cut them tomorrow

for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence

for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats

I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is the rain was

lovely just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar

my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and

the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with

their 3 Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here

and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the mosquito nets and the

smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering

down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent

me from the B Marche Paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote

on what she was very nice whats this her other name was just a P C to tell

you I sent the little present have just had a jolly warm bath and feel

a very clean dog now enjoyed it wogger she called him wogger wd give anything

to be back in Gib and hear you sing in old Madrid or Waiting Concone is

the name of those exercises he bought me one of those new some word Icouldn't

make out shawls amusing things but tear for the least thing still theyre

lovely I think dont you will always think of the lovely teas we had together

scrumptious currant scones and raspberry wafers I adore well now dearest

Doggerina be sure and write soon kind she left out regards to your father

also Captain Grove with love yrs affly x x x x x she didnt look a bit married

just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond

of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the

bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear clothes

we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney

hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed

thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid

when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderillos with

the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting

bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping

all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a

thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the

dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever

I suppose theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist

makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all

to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker

than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and

whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were

like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her

bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with

the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at

the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove

I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our

eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing

I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised

myself the change I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement

like a rose I didn't get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account

of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to

read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and

the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman

I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without

and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on

account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one

he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything

she could cloth and stuff and yards of it this blanket is too heavy on

me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all

rolled up under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be

weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the

cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and

firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the

bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line

Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never come back and

she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger

people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the

waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the swell of the

ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say

anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt

was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe

I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a

Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage

made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got

as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away

mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or

marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed

his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop

especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions

if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was

or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague

the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and

he in mourning for the son then the same old reveille in the morning and

drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about

with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in

their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the

men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the

gates and the bagpipes and only Captain Groves and father talking about

Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum

lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil

with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his

nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but

he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on

some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of

course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I supposed

he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from

a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper

in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that

old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah

heah aheah all my compriments on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad

as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there

was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street

the nurse was after when I put on my gloves and hat at the window to show

I was going out not a notion what I meant arent they thick never understand

what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not

even if you shake hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either

when I half frowned at him outside Westland row chapel where does their

great intelligence come in Id like to know grey matter they have it all

in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the City Arms intelligence

they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the

meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with

the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and

pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no

visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that

wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam only his letter and the

card from Milly this morning see she wrote a letter to him who did I get

the last letter from O Mrs Dwenn now whatever possessed her to write after

so many years to know the recipe I had for pisto madrileno Floey Dillon

since she wrote to say she was married to a very rich architect if Im to

believe all I hear with a villa and eight rooms her father was an awfully

nice man he was near seventy always good humour well now Miss Tweedy or

Miss Gillespie theres the pyannyer that was a solid silver coffee service

he had too on the mahogany sideboard then dying so far away I hate people

that have always their poor story to tell everybody has their own troubles

that poor Nancy Blake died a month ago of acute pneumonia well I didnt

know her so well as all that she was Floeys friend more than mine its a

bother having to answer he always tells me the wrong things and no stops

to say like making a speech your sad bereavement sympathy I always make

that mistake and newphew with 2 double yous in I hope hell write me a longer

letter the next time if its a thing he really likes me O thanks be to the

great God I got somebody to give me what I badly wanted to put some heart

up into me youve no chances at all in this place like you used long ago

I wish somebody would write me a love-letter his wasnt much and I told

him he could write what he liked yours ever Hugh Boylan in Old Madrid silly

women believe love is sighing I am dying still if he wrote it I suppose

thered be some truth in it true or no it fills up your whole day and life

always something to think about every moment and see it all around you

like a new world I could write the answer in bed to let him imagine me

short just a few words not those long crossed letters Atty Dillon used

to write to the fellow that was something in the four courts that jilted

her after out of the ladies letterwriter when I told her to say a few simple

words he could twist how he liked not acting with precipit precipitancy

with equal candour the greatest earthly happiness answer to a gentlemans

proposal affirmatively my goodness theres nothing else its all very fine

for them but as for being a woman as soon as youre old they might as well

throw you out in the bottom of the ash pit.



<P>Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought

it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand

me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open

it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face

with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly

as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion

domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming

in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros

because 4 drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because

I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her

shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles

of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the

sun dancing 3 times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going

by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for

his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted

to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the

shop window then he tipped me just in passing I never thought hed write

making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading

it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing

to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember

shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to

near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my

sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till

he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee

up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged

for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and

he believed that I was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many

a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things

I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls

he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited

he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the

pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he

said on the Blackwater but it was too short then the day before he left

May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like

that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under

the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and

all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering

all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular

old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones

at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on

open at the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly

they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the

firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence

the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels

cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders

all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go

under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that

was the Malta boat passing Yes the sea and the sky you could do what you

liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that

its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw

hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my

blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see

his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldn't

let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption

or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that

one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but

I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere yes because

they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years

covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out

of youd think they could never get far enough up and then theyre done with

you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling

there all the time so tender how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled

him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened

my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat I had a skirt opening

up the side I tortured the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing

that dog in the hotel rrrsssst awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying

below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that morning I made him

blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took

his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons

men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me

what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant

he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went around to

the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said

hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed

do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying

perhaps hes dead or killed or a Captain or admiral its nearly 20 years

if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands

over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about 40

perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they

all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what

I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight

too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an

article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out

the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord

what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same

way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews

burial place pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire

his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his

peaked cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight

H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar

his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the

bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense

and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that

would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked

on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre

looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better

than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them

Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about

either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might

have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had

Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Willis road to Europa point

twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking

and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs

up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper

trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at

him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make

to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze

or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere

I went up windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with Captain Rubios

that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two

from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche Paris and the coral necklace

the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangierwhite

and the At!as mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so

clear Harry Molly Darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time

after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks

and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him

there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap

peau despagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else

I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for

luck that I gave Gardner going to South Africa where those Boers killed

him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as

if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl must have been

pure 16 carat gold because it was very heavy I can see his face clean shaven

was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if that pork

chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat I couldnt

smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutchers

is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts

better than having him leaving the gas on all night I couldnt rest easy

in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I so damned nervous

about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was

rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the

big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that

icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra

nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had

up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into

bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching

with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used

to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only

when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then

there were 2 of us Goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes

not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes

young again coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still

he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all

night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink

water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea Findon haddy

and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king

of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg

wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs

of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the

cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes

as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder

do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the

top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber

too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow

or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant

jam like long ago not those 2 lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the

London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far only for the

bones I hate those eels cod yes Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting

enough for 3 forgetting anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat

from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton

and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave

5/- each and or let him pay and invite some other woman for him who Mrs

Fleming and drive out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have

him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters

no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches

there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose

but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those

ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day

too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in

this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatmen

he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the

gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding

about and the weight all down my side telling me to pull the right reins

now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through through

the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrupits a mercy we werent

all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep

yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down

off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate

till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that

longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of

the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always

where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on you vomit a better face there

was no love lost between us thats I consolation I wonder what kind is that

book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr

de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his

tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes

all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy

and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea

excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the

back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old

Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with

the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to go get at I suppose

theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in

this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with

it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion

musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with

a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether

the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father

he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely

places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas

and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines

and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately

if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get

a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving

us here all day you never know what old beggar at the door for a crust

with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent

me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called

in Lloyds Weekly News 20 years in jail then he comes out and murders an

old woman for her mofley imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she

is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted

all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked

up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat

of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman

to murder her in her bed Id cut them off so I would not that hed be much

use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in

the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as

if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his

wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit

there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially

now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to

learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending

her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all

at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and

Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything

out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the

door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I

put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below

with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her

in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off

the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness

before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you

cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you

of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking

to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending

to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house and helping

her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed

tell not him he Cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter

of fact I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well

Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting

too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of

Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand

to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans

bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting

out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes

through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread

of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much

from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it

brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it

comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste

your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom

and I had to tell her no! to cock her legs up like that on show on the

windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when

I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot

too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot

away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush

her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres

in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that

fellow in the pit at the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby

the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby

or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes

a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylish dressed

ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him

on the moment the face and everything but he didn't remember me and she

didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope

shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was

down with the mumps her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course

she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22

or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense

and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper

sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because

he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and

supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives

up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are few men like

that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to

me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to

find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel

the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father

must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor

old man I suppose he felt lost always making love to my things too the

few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at 15 my powder too only

ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course

shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont

stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing

answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of

potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she

pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent

grand enough till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself

take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she

had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because

how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before

cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives

crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself

well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned

on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the

place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead

of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant

again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed

revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking

round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting

into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found

that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew

there was something and opened the window to let out the smell bringing

in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog

if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his

father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at

the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at

the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them

in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him

that knew us wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers

as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into

the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasn't

washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the

line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid

old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never

even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was

on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something

wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its

not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone

every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when

Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want

to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come

on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting

and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday

wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men

do God knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4

weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came

on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn

gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did

about insurance for him Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt

give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses

and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead

I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp

leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the

last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a

fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress

he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round

all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then

hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood

up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow

he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean

sheets the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they

always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all

thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced

40 times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too

purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested

that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this

damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear

us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt

on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the

day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding

me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next

time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres

the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after

that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him

sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt

first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never

felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God

I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man

almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money

from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet

he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are

the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like

a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman

O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy O how the waters

come down at Lahore



<P>who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something

growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last

I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to the doctor only

it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming

from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens

diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how

he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off

Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina

and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt

marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides there something

queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches

all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want

me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it

all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriment I suppose

hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking

about the rock of Gibraltar the way he puts it thats a very nice invention

too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far

as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and

needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by

Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the

same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and

asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the

words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways

I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else

still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe

his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything

no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course

that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one

everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that

comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got

out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 or 5 times

a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite

sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural

weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met

when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for

about 10 minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being

jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with

the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going

to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe

all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long

strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy

O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling

about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally

then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance

in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his

hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use

and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day

Id better not make an all night sitting on this affair they ought to make

chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels

down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the

habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can

he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out

all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he

took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow

in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking

out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both

put together all over Asia imitating him ashes always imitating everybody

I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square

feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this

those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I

knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must

have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it

from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better

for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right

for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen

I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father

bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl

because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as

ever after 16 years how many houses were we in at all Raymond Terrace and

Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about

whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march

pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the

City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on

the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks

after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting

on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys

and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over

his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and

gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the

Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the Freemasons

then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet

all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that

he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity

of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait 3 quarters

the hour wait 2 oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be

coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him

Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt

to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook

I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent

enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth

they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats

Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in

real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting

you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs

thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another

thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them

then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose

Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one

night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half

the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them

and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I

thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong

too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont

know what he forgets that we then I dont Ill make him do it again if he

doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the

blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes

such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman

thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him

that forlornlooking spectacle you couldn't call him a husband yes its some

little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the

College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top on his

nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those

two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of

course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy

Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper

Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something

reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Bloom

and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off

falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham

and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny

thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born

all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract

them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly

and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and

they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power

keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife always sick or going to

be sick or just getting better of it and hes a good-looking man still though

hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well

theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help

it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with

his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece

he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings

poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife

and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum

always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey

wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance

theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasn't he

yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night

he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and

squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped

childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have

been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats

for that to see him and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half

screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one

of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on

for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private

opera he had a delicious glorious voice Ph<oe>be dearest goodbye <I>sweetheart</I>

he always sang it not like Bartell dArcy sweet <I>tart</I> goodbye of course

he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like

a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though

it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married

at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the

good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says

hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im

to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not

good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out

of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present

of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to

the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats

11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning

for what was neither one thing nor the other of course he insisted hed

go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was

an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy

suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons

he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on

he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a

young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant

him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned

the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spaces for a Journey

by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens

and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and

2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too

yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy

hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they

go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed

at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet

like Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite

different I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly

is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose

hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not that

stuck up university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down

in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and taking of course he

pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity

college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like

Goodwin was he was a patent professor of John Jameson they all write about

some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where

softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue

sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from

Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was

so expressive will I never go back there again all new faces two glancing

eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything

of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful

words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent

person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy

Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then, if anything goes

wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished

Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young

those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathing place from

the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something

and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered

be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought

I could look at him all-day long curly head and his shoulders his finger

up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt

I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simply

I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was

asking you to suck it so clean and white he looked with his boyish face

I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only

like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared

with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years

end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches

Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at

my age Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard

comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill

read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who

he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same

and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till

he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly

too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but

then what am I going to do about him though



<P>no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing

in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didn't

call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats

what you get for notkeeping them in their proper place pulling off his

shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even

asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt

they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites

in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass

the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion

God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would

O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short

petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men

all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and

white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try

with that thing they have swelling upon you so hard and at the same time

so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those

cornerboys saying passing the corner of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has

a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt

make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing

long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the

handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what

they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different

tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always

chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start

I tell you for stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends

over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together

well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever

he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair

Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband

or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we

given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young

still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living

with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the

wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans

bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where

we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps

of lard before ever I do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere

thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in

that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands

his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20

times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to

be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes

by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some

dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd

be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only to do it off up in

a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had

their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things

if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry

sending me back over and over some old ones old stockings that blackguardlooking

fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride

me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do

themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere

this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper

on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he

gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round

a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too

some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I

suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move

over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the

winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great

Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards

this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity

between 2 7s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know

and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his

breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see

me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they

treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for

the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going

and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling

around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing

it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop

sure they wouldn't be in the world at all only for us they dont know what

it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of

them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had

thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books

and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowdy house

I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that

theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my

fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind

in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose

I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying

as was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another

our 1st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to

think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt

stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in

instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and

pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining

himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love

coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can

talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready

to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us

the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the

troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have

slept in there on the sofa in the other room suppose he was as shy as a

boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me

on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in

Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father

Vial plana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in

the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street

O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name

like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp

and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small

blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I

dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any

of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I haven't forgotten

it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person

place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio

lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways

I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he

tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt

stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly

I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so

long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going

her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a

few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of

them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I

changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time

Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt

it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without

a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked

things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed

with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back

room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all

the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning

like me as hes making the breakfast for I he can make it for 2 Im sure

Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo

of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent well-educated

person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with

the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown

that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago

in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill get

up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go

over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes

and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh

who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the

morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her

massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when

I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea

in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed

like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too

much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieti Masetto then Ill start dressing

myself to go out presto non son pill forte Ill put on my best shift and

drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand

for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked

yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times

handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother

to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel

my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to

tell him every scrap and make him do it in front of me serve him right

its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery

said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of

tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose

thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made

us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom

Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as

life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part

then Ill tell him I want #1 or perhaps 30/- Ill tell him I want to buy

underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want

to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written

out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds

a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him

do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I

suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent I or 2 questions Ill

know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know

every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words

smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then

Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay

and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing

pfooh you wouldn't know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum

and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be

more pointed hell never know whether he did it nor not there thats good

enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like

a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eyeing up at the ceiling

where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after

what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing

out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus

theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two

for his night office the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the

brains out of itself let me see if I can dose off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of

flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard

street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only

I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get

up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send

us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow

today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place

up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can have

music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the keys of

the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy

cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at 71/2d a lb or the

other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar lid a couple of

lbs of course a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper

in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have

the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature

the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful

country with fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the

fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and

lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing

up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them

saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their

learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists

or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves

first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because

theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know

them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody

that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are

they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines

for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth

head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose

to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was

leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost

my breath yes he said was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers

all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the

sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he

understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round

him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked

me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and

the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr

Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing

all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the

pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round

his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing

in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the

Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all

the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside

Larby Sharans and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows

in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the

carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those

handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down

in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas

glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops

half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at

Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful

deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and

the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all

the queer little streets and pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens

and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where

I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like

the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me

under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then

I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I

yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes

and drew him down Jo me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and

his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.
