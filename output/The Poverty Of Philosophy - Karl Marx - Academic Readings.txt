FOREWORD</H3></CENTER>



<UL><FONT SIZE=+2>M. Proudhon</FONT> has the misfortune of being peculiarly

misunderstood in Europe. In France, he has the right to be a bad economist,

because he is reputed to be a good German philosopher. In Germany, he has

the right to be a bad philosopher, because he is reputed to be one of the

ablest French economists. Being both German and economist at the same time,

we desire to protest against this double error.



<P>&nbsp;The reader will understand that in this thankless task we have

often had to abandon our criticism of M. Proudhon in order to criticize

German philosophy, and at the same time to give some observations on political

economy.



<P>&nbsp;

<UL><I>Karl Marx</I>

<BR>Brussels, June 15, 1847



<P>&nbsp;</UL>

M. Proudhon's work is not just a treatise on political economy, an ordinary

book; it is a bible. "mysteries", "Secrets Wrested from the Bosom of God",

"Revelations" -- it lacks nothing. But as prophets are discussed nowadays

more conscientiously than profane writers, the reader must resign himself

to going with us through the arid and gloomy eruditions of "Genesis", in

order to ascend later, with M. Proudhon, into the ethereal and fertile

realm of super-socialism. (See Proudhon, Philosophy of Poverty, Prologue,

p.III, line 20.)</UL>

<TD>"The capacity for all products, whether natural or industrial, to contribute

to man's subsistence is specifically termed use value; their capacity to

be given in exchange for one another, exchange value.... How does use value

become exchange value?... The genesis of the idea of (exchange) value has

not been noted by economists with sufficient care. It is necessary, therefore,

for us to dwell upon it. Since a very large number of the things I need

occur in nature only in moderate quantities, or even not at all, I am forced

to assist in the production of what I lack. And as I cannot set my hand

to so many things, I shall propose to other men, my collaborators in various

functions, to cede to me a part of their products in exchange for mine."

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>(Proudhon, Vol.I, Chap.II)



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

&nbsp;

<UL><FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>. Proudhon undertakes to explain to us first

of all the double nature of value, the "distinction in value", the process

by which use value is transformed into exchange value. It is necessary

for us to dwell with M. Proudhon upon this act of transubstantiation. The

following is how this act is accomplished, according to our author.



<P>&nbsp;A very large number of products are not to be found in nature,

they are products of industry. If man's needs go beyond nature's spontaneous

production, he is forced to have recourse to industrial production. What

is this industry in M. Proudhon's view? What is its origin? A single individual,

feeling the need for a very great number of things, "cannot set his hand

to so many things". So many things to produce presuppose at once more than

one man's hand helping to produce them. Now, the moment you postulate more

than one hand helping in production, you at once presuppose a whole production

based on the division of labor. Thus need, as M. Proudhon presupposes it,

itself presupposes the whole division of labor. In presupposing the division

of labor, you get exchange, and, consequently, exchange value. One might

as well have presupposed exchange value from the very beginning.



<P>&nbsp;But M. Proudhon prefers to go the roundabout way. Let us follow

him in all his detours, which always bring him back to his starting point.



<P>&nbsp;In order to emerge from the condition in which everyone produces

in isolation and to arrive at exchange, "I turn to my collaborators in

various functions," says M. Proudhon. I, myself, then, have collaborators,

all with different function. And yet, for all that, I and all the others,

always according to M. Proudhon's supposition, have got no farther than

the solitary and hardly social position of the Robinsons. The collaborators

and the various functions, the division of labor and the exchange it implies,

are already at hand.



<P>&nbsp;To sum up: I have certain needs which are founded on the division

of labor and on exchange. In presupposing these needs, M. Proudhon has

thus presupposed exchange, exchange value, the very thing of which he purposes

to "note the genesis with more care than other economists".



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon might just as well have inverted the order of things,

without in any way affecting the accuracy of his conclusions. To explain

exchange value, we must have exchange. To explain exchange, we must have

the division of labor. To explain the division of labor, we must have needs

which render necessary the division of labor. To explain these needs, we

must "presuppose" them, which is not to deny them -- contrary to the first

axiom in M. Proudhon's prologue: "To presuppose God is to deny Him." (Prologue,

p.1)



<P>&nbsp;How does M. Proudhon, who assumes the division of labor as the

known, manage to explain exchange value, which for him is always the unknown?



<P>&nbsp;"A man" sets out to "propose to other men, his collaborators in

various functions", that they establish exchange, and make a distinction

between ordinary value and exchange value. In accepting this proposed distinction,

the collaborators have left M. Proudhon no other "care" than that of recording

the fact, or marking, of "noting" in his treatise on political economy

"the genesis of the idea of value". But he has still to explain to us the

"genesis" of this proposal, to tell us finally how this single individual,

this Robinson [Crusoe], suddenly had the idea of making "to his collaborators"

a proposal of the type known and how these collaborators accepted it without

the slightest protest.



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon does not enter into these genealogical details. He

merely places a sort of historical stamp upon the fact of exchange, by

presenting it in the form of a motion, made by a third party, that exchange

be established.



<P>&nbsp;That is a sample of the "historical and descriptive method" of

M. Proudhon, who professes a superb disdain for the "historical and descriptive

methods" of the Adam Smiths and Ricardos.



<P>&nbsp;Exchange has a history of its own. It has passed through different

phases. There was a time, as in the Middle Ages, when only the superfluous,

the excess of production over consumption, was exchanged.



<P>&nbsp;There was again a time, when not only the superfluous, but all

products, all industrial existence, had passed into commerce, when the

whole of production depended on exchange. How are we to explain this second

phase of exchange -- marketable value at its second power?



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon would have a reply ready-made: Assume that a man has

"proposed to other men, his collaborators in various functions", to raise

marketable value to its second power.



<P>&nbsp;Finally, there came a time when everything that men had considered

as inalienable became an object of exchange, of traffic and could be alienated.

This is the time when the very things which till then had been communicated,

but never exchanged; given, but never sold; acquired, but never bought

-- virtue, love, conviction, knowledge, conscience, etc. -- when everything,

in short, passed into commerce. It is the time of general corruption, of

universal venality, or, to speak in terms of political economy, the time

when everything, moral or physical, having become a marketable value, is

brought to the market to be assessed at its truest value.



<P>&nbsp;How, again, can we explain this new and last phase of exchange

-- marketable value at its third power?



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon would have a reply ready-made: Assume that a person

has "proposed to other persons, his collaborators in various functions",

to make a marketable value out of virtue, love, etc., to raise exchange

value to its third and last power.



<P>&nbsp;We see that M. Proudhon's "historical and descriptive method"

is applicable to everything, it answers everything, explains everything.

If it is a question above all of explaining historically "the genesis of

an economic idea", it postulates a man who proposes to other men, " his

collaborators in various functions", that they perform this act of genesis

and that is the end of it.



<P>&nbsp;We shall hereafter accept the "genesis" of exchange value as an

accomplished act; it now remains only to expound the relation between exchange

value and use value. Let us hear what M. Proudhon has to say:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TD>"Economists have very well brought out the double character of value,

but why they have not pointed out with the same precision is its contradictory

nature; there is where our criticism begins....



<P>&nbsp;"It is a small thing to have drawn attention to this surprising

contrast between use value and exchange value, in which economists have

been wont to see only something very simple: we must show that this alleged

simplicity conceals a profound mystery into which it is our duty to penetrate....



<P>&nbsp;"In technical terms, use value and exchange value stand in inverse

ratio to each other."

If we have thoroughly grasped M. Proudhon's thought the following are the

four points which he sets out to establish:

Use value and exchange value form a "surprising contrast", they are in

opposition to each other.</LI>





<P>&nbsp;

<LI>

Use value and exchange value are in inverse ratio, in contradiction, to

<LI>

Economists have neither observed not recognized either the opposition or

the contradiction.</LI>





<P>&nbsp;

<LI>

M. Proudhon's criticism begins at the end.</LI>





<P>&nbsp;</OL>

We, too, shall begin at the end, and, in order to clear the economists

from M. Proudhon's accusations, we shall let two sufficiently well-known

economists speak for themselves.

</TABLE></CENTER>

We have just seen that the economists before M. Proudhon had "drawn attention"

to the profound mystery of opposition and contradiction. Let us now see

how M. Proudhon explains this mystery after the economists.



<P>&nbsp;The exchange value of a product falls as the supply increases,

the demand remaining the same; in other words, the more abundant a product

is relatively to the demand, the lower is its exchange value, or price.

Vice versa: The weaker the supply relatively to the demand, the higher

rises the exchange value or the price of the product supplied: in other

words, the greater the scarcity in the products supplied, relatively to

the demand, the higher the prices. The exchange value of a product depends

upon its abundance or its scarcity; but always in relation to the demand.

Take a product that is more than scarce, unique of its kind if you will:

this unique product will be more than abundant, it will be superfluous,

if there is no demand for it. On the other hand, take a product multiplied

into millions, it will always be scarce if it does not satisfy the demand,

that is, if there is too great a demand for it.



<P>&nbsp;These are what we should almost call truisms, yet we have had

to repeat them here in order to render M. Proudhon's mysteries comprehensible.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"So that, following up the principle to its ultimate consequences,

one would come to the conclusion, the most logical in the world, that the

things whose use is indispensable and whose quantity is unlimited should

be had for nothing, and those whose utility is nil and whose scarcity is

extreme should be of incalculable worth. To cap the difficulty, these extremes

are impossible in practice: on the one hand, no human product could ever

be unlimited in magnitude; on the other, even the scarcest things must

perforce be useful to a certain degree, otherwise they would be quite valueless.

Use value and exchange value are thus inexorably bound up with each other,

although by their nature they continually tend to be mutually exclusive."

</TR>



<TR>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>(Volume I, p.39)



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

What caps M. Proudhon's difficulty? That he has simply forgotten about

demand, and that a thing can be scarce or abundant only in so far as it

is in demand. The moment he leaves out demand, he identifies exchange value

with scarcity and use value with abundance. In reality, in saying that

things "whose utility is nil and scarcity extreme are of incalculable worth",

he is simply declaring that exchange value is merely scarcity. "Scarcity

extreme and utility nil" means pure scarcity. "Incalculable worth" is the

maximum of exchange value, it is pure exchange value. He equates these

two terms. Therefore exchange value and scarcity are equivalent terms.

In arriving at these alleged "extreme consequences", M. Proudhon has in

fact carried to the extreme, not the things, but the terms which express

them, and, in so doing, he shows proficiency in rhetoric rather than in

logic. He merely rediscovers his first hypotheses in all their nakedness,

when he think he has discovered new consequences. Thanks to the same procedure

he succeeds in identifying use value with pure abundance.



<P>&nbsp;After having equated exchange value and scarcity, use value and

abundance, M. Proudhon is quite astonished not to find use value in scarcity

and exchange value, nor exchange value in abundance and use value; and

seeing that these extremes are impossible in practice, he can do nothing

but believe in mystery. Incalculable worth exists for him, because buyers

do not exist, and he will never find any buyers, so long as he leaves out

demand.



<P>&nbsp;On the other hand, M. Proudhon's abundance seems to be something

spontaneous. He completely forgets that there are people who produce it,

and that it is to their interest never to lose sight of demand. Otherwise,

how could M. Proudhon have said that things which are very useful must

have a very low price, or even cost nothing? On the contrary, he should

have concluded that abundance, the production of very useful things, should

be restricted if their price, their exchange value is to be raised.



<P>&nbsp;The old vine-growers of France in petitioning for a law to forbid

the planting of new vines; the Dutch in burning Asiatic spices, in uprooting

clove trees in the Moluccas, were simply trying to reduce abundance in

order to raise exchange value. During the whole of the Middle Ages this

same principle was acted upon, in limiting by laws the number of journeymen

a single master could employ and the number of implements he could use.

(See Anderson, <I>History of Commerce</I>.) [The full reference: A. Anderson,

<I>An Historical and Chronological Deduction of the Origin of Commerce

from the Earliest Accounts to the Present Time</I>. First edition appeared

in London in 1764. p.33]



<P>&nbsp;After having represented abundance as use value and scarcity as

exchange value -- nothing indeed is easier than to prove that abundance

and scarcity are in inverse ratio -- M. Proudhon identifies use value with

<I>supply</I> and exchange value with <I>demand</I>. To make the antithesis

even more clear-cut, he substitutes a new term, putting "estimation value"

instead of exchange value. The battle has now shifted its ground, and we

have on one side <I>utility</I> (use value, supply), on the other side,

<I>estimation</I> (exchange value, demand).



<P>&nbsp;Who is to reconcile these two contradictory forces? What is to

be done to bring them into harmony with each other? Is it possible to find

in them even a single point of comparison?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"Certainly," cries M. Proudhon, "there is one -- free will. The price

resulting from this battle between supply and demand, between utility and

estimation will not be the expression of eternal justice."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

M. Proudhon goes on to develop this antithesis.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"In my capacity as a free buyer, I am judge of my needs, judge of the

desirability of an object, judge of the price I am willing to pay for it.

On the other hand, in your capacity as a free producer, you are master

of the means of execution, and in consequence, you have the power to reduce

your expenses."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>(Volume I, p.41)



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

And as demand, or exchange value, is identical with estimation, M. Proudhon

is led to say:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"It is proved that it is man's free will that gives rise to the opposition

between use value and exchange value. How can this opposition be removed,

so long as free will exists? And how can the latter be sacrificed without

sacrificing mankind?"



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>(Volume I, p.41)



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

Thus there is no possible way out. There is a struggle between two as it

were incommensurable powers, between utility and estimation, between the

free buyer and the free producer.



<P>&nbsp;Let us look at things a little more closely.



<P>&nbsp;Supply does not represent exclusively utility, demand does not

represent exclusively estimation. Does not the demander also supply a certain

product or the token representing all products -- viz., money; and as supplier,

does he not represent, according to M. Proudhon, utility or use value?



<P>&nbsp;Again, does not the supplier also demand a certain product or

the token representing all product -- viz., money? And does he not thus

become the representative of estimation, of estimation value or of exchange

value?



<P>&nbsp;Demand is at the same time a supply, supply is at the same time

a demand. Thus M. Proudhon's antithesis, in simply identifying supply and

demand, the one with utility, the other with estimation, is based only

on a futile abstraction.



<P>&nbsp;What M. Proudhon calls use value is called estimation value by

other economists, and with just as much right. We shall quote only Storch

(<I>Cours d'economie politique</I>, Paris 1823, pp.48 and 49).



<P>&nbsp;According to him, <I>needs</I> are the things for which we feel

the need; <I>values</I> are things to which we attribute value. Most things

have value only because they satisfy needs engendered by estimation. The

estimation of our needs may change; therefore the utility of things, which

expresses only the relation of these things to our needs, may also change.

Natural needs themselves are continually changing. Indeed, what could be

more varied than the objects which form the staple food of different peoples!



<P>&nbsp;The conflict does not take place between utility and estimation;

it takes place between the marketable value demanded by the supplier and

the marketable value supplied by the demander. The exchange value of the

product is each time the resultant of these contradictory appreciations.



<P>&nbsp;In final analysis, supply and demand bring together production

and consumption, but production and consumption based on individual exchanges.



<P>&nbsp;The product supplied is not useful in itself. It is the consumer

who determines its utility. And even when its quality of being useful is

admitted, it does not exclusively represent utility. In the course of production,

it has been exchanged for all the costs of production, such as raw materials,

wages of workers, etc., all of which are marketable values. The product,

therefore, represents, in the eyes of the producer, a sum total of marketable

values. What he supplies is not only a useful object, but also and above

all a marketable value.



<P>&nbsp;As to demand, it will only be effective on condition that it has

means of exchange at its disposal. These means are themselves products,

marketable value.



<P>&nbsp;In supply and demand, then, we find on the one hand a product

which has cost marketable values, and the need to sell; on the other, means

which have cost marketable values, and the desire to buy.



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon opposes the free buyer to the free producer. To the

one and to the other he attributes purely metaphysical qualities. It is

this that makes him say:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"It is proved that it is man's free will that gives rise to the opposition

between use value and exchange value."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>[I 41]



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

The producer, the moment he produces in a society founded on the division

of labor and on exchange (and that is M. Proudhon's hypothesis), is forced

to sell. M. Proudhon makes the producer master of the means of production;

but he will agree with us that his means of production do not depend on

free will. Moreover, many of these means of production are products which

he gets from the outside, and in modern production he is not even free

to produce the amount he wants. The actual degree of development of the

productive forces compels him to produce on such or such a scale.



<P>&nbsp;The consumer is no freer than the producer. His judgment depends

on his means and his needs. Both of these are determined by his social

position, which itself depends on the whole social organization. True,

the worker who buys potatoes and the kept woman who buys lace both follow

their respective judgments. But the difference in their judgements is explained

by the difference in the positions which they occupy in the world, and

which themselves are the product of social organization.



<P>&nbsp;Is the entire system of needs on estimation or on the whole organization

of production? Most often, needs arise directly from production or from

a state of affairs based on production. Thus, to choose another example,

does not the need for lawyers suppose a given civil law which is but the

expression of a certain development of property, that is to say, of production?



<P>&nbsp;It is not enough for M. Proudhon to have eliminated the elements

just mentioned from the relation of supply and demand. He carries abstraction

to the furthest limits when he fuses all producers into one single producer,

all consumers into one single consumer, and sets up a struggle between

these two chimerical personages. But in the real world, things happen otherwise.

The competition among the suppliers and the competition among the demanders

form a necessary part of the struggle between buyers and sellers, of which

marketable value is the result.



<P>&nbsp;After having eliminated competition and the cost of production,

M. Proudhon can at his ease reduce the formula of supply and demand to

an absurdity.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"Supply and demand," he says, "are merely two ceremonial forms that

serve to bring use value and exchange value face to face, and to lead to

their reconciliation. They are the two electric poles which, when connected,

must produce the phenomenon of affinity called exchange."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>(Volume I, pp.49 and 50)



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

One might as well say that exchange is merely a "ceremonial form" for introducing

the consumer to the object of consumption. One might as well say that all

economic relations are "ceremonial forms" serving immediate consumption

as go-betweens. Supply and demand are neither more nor less relations of

a given production than are individual exchanges.



<P>&nbsp;What, then, does all M. Proudhon's dialectic consist in? In the

substitition for use value and exchange value, for supply and demand, of

abstract and contradictory notions like scarcity and abundance, utility

and estimation, <I>one</I> producer and <I>one</I> consumer, both of them

knights of free will.



<P>&nbsp;And what was he aiming at?



<P>&nbsp;At arranging for himself a means of introducing later on one of

the elements he had set aside, the cost of production, as the synthesis

of use value and exchange value. And it is thus that in his eyes the cost

of production constitutes synthetic value or constituted value.

<UL><FONT SIZE=+2>"V</FONT>alue (marketable value) is the corner-stone

the system of economic contradictions.



<P>&nbsp;What then is this "constituted value' which is all M. Proudhon

has discovered in political economy?



<P>&nbsp;Once utility is admitted, labor is the source of all value. The

measure of labor is time. The relative value of products is determined

by the labor time required for their production. Price is the monetary

expression of the relative value of a product. Finally, the the constituted

value of a product is purely and simply the value which is constituted

by the labor time incorporated in it.



<P>&nbsp;Just as Adam Smith discovered the division of labor, so he, M.

Proudhon, claims to have discovered "constituted value". This is not exactly

"something unheard of", but then it must be admitted that there is nothing

unheard of in ny discovery of economic science. M. Proudhon, who appreciates

to the full the importance of his own invention, seeks nevertheless to

tone down the merit therefore "in order to reassure the reader to as his

claims to originality, and to win over minds whose timidity renders them

little favorable to new ideas". But in apportioning the contribution made

by each of his predecessors to the understanding of value, he is forced

to confess openly that the largest portion, the lion's share, of the merit

falls to himself.

equality, is what the economists of the 19th century are resolved to uphold

Posterity, so abruptly invoked, will begin by getting muddled over the

chronology. It is bound to ask itself: are not Ricardo and his school economists

of the 19th century? Ricardo's system, putting as a principle that "the

relative value of commodities corresponds exclusively to their production",

dates from 1817. Ricardo is the head of a whole school dominant in England

since the Restoration. [The period in question begins after the termination

of the Napoleonic wars and restoration of the Bourbon dynasty in France

in 1815.] The Ricardian doctrine summarizes severely, remorselessly, the

whole of the English bourgeoisie. "What will posterity say about it?" It

will not say that M. Proudhon did not know Ricardo, for he talks about

him, he talks at length about him, he keeps coming back to him, and concludes

by calling his system "trash". If ever posterity does interfere, it will

say perhaps that M. Proudhon, afraid of offending his readers' Anglophobia,

preferred to make himself the responsible editor of Ricardo's ideas. In

any case, it will think it very naive that M. Proudhon should give as a

"revolutionary theory of the future" what Ricardo expounded scientifically

as the theory of present-day society, of bourgeois society, and that he

should thus take for the solution of the antinomy between utility and exchange

value what Ricardo and his school presented long before him as the scientific

formula of one single side of this antinomy, that of exchange value. But

let us leave posterity alone once and for all, and confront M. Proudhon

with his predecessor Ricardo. Here are some extracts from this author which

summarize his doctrine on value:

Ricardo goes on to reproach Smith:



<P>&nbsp;

<OL>

<LI>

With having "himself erected another standard measure of value" than labor.

"Sometimes he speaks of corn, at other times of labor, as a standard measure;

not the quantity of labor bestowed on the production of any object, but

the quantity it can command in the market." (Vol.I, pp.9 and 10)</LI>





<P>&nbsp;

<LI>

With having "admitted the principle without qualification and at the same

time restricted its application to that early and rude state of society,

which precedes both the accumulation of stock and the appropriation of

land". (Vol.I, p.21)</LI>





<P>&nbsp;</OL>

Ricardo sets out to prove that the ownership of land, that is, ground rent,

cannot change the relative value of commodities and that the accumulation

of capital has only a passing and fluctuation effect on the relative values

determined by the comparative quantity of labor expended on their production.

In support of this thesis, he gives his famous theory of ground rent, analyses

capital, and ultimately finds nothing in it but accumulated labor. Then

he develops a whole theory of wages and profits, and proves that wages

and profits rise and fall in inverse ratio to each other, without affecting

the relative value of the product. He does not neglect the influence that

the accumulation of capital and its different aspects (fixed capital and

circulating capital), as also the rate of wages, can have on the proportional

value of products. In fact, they are the chief problems with which Ricardo

is concerned.

Lord Lauderdale had developed the variations of exchange value according

to the law of supply and demand, or of scarcity and abundance relatively

to demand. In his opinion the value of a thing can increase when its quantity

decreases or when the demand for it increases; it can decrease owing to

an increase of its quantity or owing to the decrease in demand. Thus the

value of a thing can change through eight different causes, namely, four

causes that apply to money or to any other commodity which serves as a

measure of its value. Here is Ricardo's refutation:



<P>&nbsp;

has no necessary connexion with their natural value; but the prices of

commodities, which are subject to competition, and whose quantity may be

increased in any moderate degree, will ultimately depend, not on the state

of demand and supply, but on the increased or diminished cost of their

production."

We shall leave it to the reader to make the comparison between this simple,

clear, precise language of Ricardo's and M. Proudhon's rhetorical attempts

to arrive at the determination of relative value by labor time.



<P>&nbsp;Ricardo shows us the real movement of bourgeois production, which

constitutes value. M. Proudhon, leaving the real movement out of account,

"fumes and frets" in order to invent new processes and to achieve the reorganization

of the world on a would-be new formula, which formula is no more than the

theoretical expression of the real movement which exists and which is so

well described by Ricardo. Ricardo takes his starting point from present-day

society to demonstrate to us how it constitutes value -- M. Proudhon takes

constituted value as his starting point to construct a new social world

with the aid of this value. For him, M. Proudhon, constituted value must

move around and become once more the constituting factor in a world already

completely constituted according to this mode of evaluation. The determination

of value by labor time, is, for Ricardo, the law of exchange value; for

M. Proudhon. it is the synthesis of use value and exchange value. Ricardo's

theory of values is the scientific interpretation of actual economic life;

M. Proudhon's theory of values is the utopian interpretation of Ricardo's

theory. Ricardo establishes the truth of his formula by deriving it from

all economic relations, and by explaining in this way all phenomena, even

those like ground rent, accumulation of capital and the relation of wages

to profits, which at first sight seems to contradict it; it is precisely

that which makes his doctrine a scientific system: M. Proudhon, who has

rediscovered this formula of Ricardo's by means of quite arbitrary hypotheses,

is forced thereafter to seek out isolated economic facts which he twists

and falsifies to pass them off as examples, already existing applications,

beginning of realization of his regenerating idea. (See our S.3. APPLICATION

OF CONSTITUTED VALUE)



<P>&nbsp;Now let us pass on to the conclusions M. Proudhon draws from value

constituted (by labor time).



<P>&nbsp;

<UL>

<LI>

A certain quantity of labor is equivalent to the product created by this

same quantity of labor.</LI>





<P>&nbsp;

<LI>

Each day's labor is worth as much as another day's labor; that is to say,

if the quantities are equal, one man's labor is worth as much as another

man's labor: there is no qualitative difference. With the same quantity

of work, one man's product can be given in exchange for another man's product.

All men are wage workers getting equal pay for an equal time of work. Perfect

equality rules the exchanges.</LI>





<P>&nbsp;</UL>

Are these conclusions the strict, natural consequences of value "constituted"

or determined by labor time?



<P>&nbsp;If the relative value of a commodity is determined by the quantity

of labor required to produce it, it follows naturally that the relative

value of labor, or wages, is likewise determined by the quantity of labor

needed to produce the wages. Wages, that is, the relative value or the

price of labor, are thus determined by the labor time needed to produce

all that is necessary for the maintenance of the worker.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"Diminish the cost of production of hats, and their price will ultimately

fall to their own new natural price, although the demand should be doubled,

trebled, or quadrupled. Diminish the cost of subsistence of men, by diminishing

the natural price of food and clothing, by which life is sustained, and

wages will ultimately fall, notwithstanding the demand for laborers may

very greatly increase."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>(Ricardo, Vol.II, p.253)



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

Doubtless, Ricardo's language is as cynical as can be. To put the cost

of manufacture of hats and the cost of maintenance of men on the same plane

is to turn men into hats. But do not make an outcry at the cynicism of

it. The cynicism is in the facts and not in the words which express the

facts. French writers like MM. Droz, Blanqui, Rossi and others take an

innocent satisfaction in proving their superiority over the English economists,

by seeking to observe the etiquette of a "humanitarian" phraseology; if

they reproach Ricardo and his school for their cynical language, it is

because it annoys them to see economic relations exposed in all their crudity,

to see the mysteries of the bourgeoisie unmasked.



<P>&nbsp;To sum up: Labor, being itself a commodity, is measured as such

by the labor time needed to produce the labor-commodity. And what is needed

to produce this labor-commodity? Just enough labor time to produce the

objects indispensable to the constant maintenance of labor, that is, to

keep the worker alive and in a condition to propagate his race. The natural

price of labor is no other than the wage minimum. <A HREF="#n3">[3]</A>

If the current rate of wages rises above this natural price, it is precisely

because the law of value put as a principle by M. Proudhon happens to be

counterbalanced by the consequences of the varying relations of supply

and demand. But the minimum wage is nonetheless the centre towards which

the current rates of wages gravitate.



<P>&nbsp;Thus relative value, measured by labor time, is inevitably the

formula of the present enslavement of the worker, instead of being, as

M. Proudhon would have it, the "revolutionary theory" of the emancipation

of the proletariat.



<P>&nbsp;Let us now see to what extent the application of labor time as

a measure of value is incompatible with the existing class antagonism and

the unequal distribution of the product between the immediate worker and

the owner of accumulated labor.



<P>&nbsp;Let us take a particular product: broadcloth, which has required

the same quantity of labor as the linen.



<P>&nbsp;If there is an exchange of these two products, there is an exchange

of equal quantities of labor. In exchanging these equal quantities of labor

time, one does not change the reciprocal position of the producers, any

more than one changes anything in the situation of the workers and manufacturers

among themselves. To say that this exchange of products measured by labor

time results in an equality of payment for all the producers is to suppose

that equality of participation in the product existed before the exchange.

When the exchange of broadcloth for linen has been accomplished, the producers

of broadcloth will share in the linen in a proportion equal to that in

which they previously shared in the broadcloth.



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon's illusion is brought about by his taking for a consequence

what could be at most but a gratuitous supposition.



<P>&nbsp;Let us go further.



<P>&nbsp;Does labor time, as the measure of value, suppose at least that

the days are equivalent, and that one man's day is worth as much as another's?

No.



<P>&nbsp;Let us suppose for a moment that a jeweller's day is equivalent

to three days of a weaver; the fact remains that any change in the value

of jewels relative to that of woven materials, unless it be the transitory

result of the fluctuations of supply and demand, must have as its cause

a reduction or an increase in the labor time expended in the production

of one or the other. If three working days of different workers be related

to one another in the ratio of 1:2:3, then every change in the relative

value of their products will be a change in this same proportion of 1:2:3.

Thus values can be measured by labor time, in spite of the inequality of

value of different working days; but to apply such a measure we must have

a comparative scale of the different working days: it is competition that

sets up this scale.



<P>&nbsp;Is your hour's labor worth mine? That is a question which is decided

by competition.



<P>&nbsp;Competition, according to an American economist, determines how

many days of simple labor are contained in one day's compound labor. Does

not this reduction of days of compound labor to days of simple labor suppose

that simple labor is itself taken as a measure of value? If the mere quantity

of labor functions as a measure of value regardless of quality, it presupposes

that simple labor has become the pivot of industry. It presupposes that

labor has been equalized by the subordination of man to the machine or

by the extreme division of labor; that men are effaced by their labor;

that the pendulum of the clock has become as accurate a measure of the

relative activity of two workers as it is of the speed of two locomotives.

Therefore, we should not say that one man's hour is worth another man's

hour, but rather that one man during an hour is worth just as much as another

man during an hour. Time is everything, man is nothing; he is, at the most,

time's carcase. Quality no longer matters. Quantity alone decides everything;

hour for hour, day for day; but this equalizing of labor is not by any

means the work of M. Proudhon's eternal justice; it is purely and simply

a fact of modern industry.



<P>&nbsp;In the automatic workshop, one worker's labor is scarely distinguishable

in any way from another worker's labor: workers can only be distinguished

one from another by the length of time they take for their work. Nevertheless,

this quantitative difference becomes, from a certain point of view, qualitative,

in that the time they take for their work depends partly on purely material

causes, such as physical constitution, age and sex; partly on purely negative

moral causes, such as patience, imperturbability, diligence. In short,

if there is a difference of quality in the labor of different workers,

it is at most a quality of the last kind, which is far from being a distinctive

speciality. This is what the state of affairs in modern industry amounts

to in the last analysis. It is upon this equality, already realized in

automatic labor, that M. Proudhon wields his smoothing-plane of "equalization",

which he means to establish universally in "time to come"!



<P>&nbsp;All the "equalitarian" consequences which M. Proudhon deduces

from Ricardo's doctrine are based on a fundamental error. He confounds

the value of commodities measured by the quantity of labor embodied in

them with the value of commodities measured by "the value of labor". If

these two ways of measuring the value of commodities were equivalent, it

could be said indifferently that the relative value of any commodity is

measured by the quantity of labor embodied in it; or that it is measured

by the quantity of labor it can buy; or again that it is measured by the

quantity of labor which can acquire it. But this is far from being so.

The value of labor can no more serve as a measure of value than the value

of any other commodity. A few examples will suffice to explain still better

what we have just stated.



<P>&nbsp;If a quarter of wheat cost two days' labor instead of one, it

would have twice its original value; but it would not set in operation

double the quantity of labor, because it would contain no more nutritive

matter than before. Thus the value of the corn, measured by the quantity

of labor used to produce it, would have doubled; but measured either by

the quantity of labor it can buy or the quantity of labor with which it

can be bought, it would be far from having doubled. On the other hand,

if the same labor produced twice as many clothes as before, their relative

value would fall by half; but, nevertheless, this double quantity of clothing

would not thereby be reduced to disposing over only half the quantity of

labor, nor could the same labor command the double quantity of clothing;

for half the clothes would still go on rendering the worker the same service

as before.



<P>&nbsp;Thus it is going against economic facts to determine the relative

value of commodities by the value of labor. It is moving in a vicious circle,

it is to determine relative value by a relative value which itself needs

to be determined.



<P>&nbsp;It is beyond doubt that M. Proudhon confuses the two measures,

measure by the labor time needed for the production of a commodity and

measure by the value of the labor. "Any man's labor," he says, "can buy

the value it represents." Thus, according to him, a certain quantity of

labor embodied in a product is equivalent to the worker's payment, that

is, to the value of labor. It is the same reasoning that makes him confuse

cost of production with wages.

Adam Smith takes as the measure of value, now the time of labor needed

for the production of a commodity, now the value of labor. Ricardo exposes

this error by showing clearly the disparity of these two ways of measuring.

M. Proudhon goes one better than Adam Smith in error by identifying the

two things which the latter had merely put in juxtaposition.



<P>&nbsp;It is in order to find the proper proposition in which workers

should share in the products, or, in other words, to determine the relative

value of labor, that M. Proudhon seeks a measure for the relative value

of commodities. To find out the measure relative value of commodities he

can think of nothing better than to give as the equivalent of a certain

quantity of labor the sum total of the products it has created, which is

as good as supposing that the whole of society consists merely of workers

who receive their own produce as wages. In the second place, he takes for

granted the equivalence of the working days of different workers. In short,

he seeks the measure of the relative value of commodities. What admirable

dialectics!

We have seen that M. Proudhon makes the value of labor the "determining

cause" of the value of products to such an extent that for him wages, the

official name for the "value of labor", form the integral price of all

things: that is why Say's objection troubles hiM. In labor as a commodity,

which is a grim reality, he sees nothing but a grammatical ellipsis. Thus

the whole of existing society, founded on labor as a commodity, is henceforth

founded on a poetic licence, a figurative expression. If society wants

to "eliminate all the drawbacks" that assail it, well, let it eliminate

all the ill-sounding terms, change the language; and to this end it has

only to apply to the Academy for a new edition of its dictionary. After

all that we have just seen, it is easy for us to understand why M. Proudhon,

in a work on political economy, has to enter upon long dissertations on

etymology and other parts of grammar. Thus he is still learnedly discussing

the antiquated derivation of <I>servus</I> from <I>servare</I>. These philological

dissertations have a deep meaning, an esoteric meaning -- they form an

essential part of M. Proudhon's argument.



<P>&nbsp;Labor <A HREF="#n4">[4]</A>, inasmuch as it is bought and sold,

is a commodity like any other commodity, and has, in consequence, an exchange

value. But the value of labor, or labor as a commodity, produces as little

as the value of wheat, or wheat as a commodity, serves as food.



<P>&nbsp;Labor "is worth" more or less, according to whether food commodities

are more or less dear, whether the supply and demand of hands exist to

such or such a degree, etc., etc.



<P>&nbsp;Labor is not a "vague thing"; it is always some definite labor,

it is never labor in general that is bought and sold. It is not only labor

that is qualitatively defined by the object; but also the object which

is determined by the specific quality of labor.



<P>&nbsp;Labor, in so far as it is bought and sold, is itself a commodity.

Why is it bought? "Because of the values it is supposed potentially to

contain." But if a certain thing is said to be a commodity, there is no

longer any question as to the reason why it is bought, that is, as to the

utility to be derived from it, the application to be made of it. It is

a commodity as an object of traffic. All M. Proudhon's arguments are limited

to this: labor is not bought as an immediate object of consumption. No,

it is bought as an instrument of production, as a machine would be bought.

As a commodity, labor has no value and does not produce. M. Proudhon might

just as well have said that there is no such thing as a commodity, since

every commodity is obtained merely for some utilitarian purpose, and never

as a commodity in itself.



<P>&nbsp;In measuring the value of commodities by labor, M. Proudhon vaguely

glimpses the impossibility of excluding labor from this same measure, in

so far as labor has a value, as labor is a commodity. He has a misgiving

that it is turning the wage minimum into the natural and normal price of

immediate labor, that is is accepting the existing state of society. So,

to get away from this fatal consequence, he faces about and asserts that

labor is not a commodity, that it cannot have value. He forgets that he

himself has taken the value of labor as a measure, he forgets that his

whole system rests on labor as a commodity, on labor which is bartered,

bought, sold, exchanged for produce, etc., on labor, in fact, which is

an immediate source of income for the worker. He forgets everything.



<P>&nbsp;To save his system, he consents to sacrifice its basis.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas!</CENTER>





<P>We now come to a new definition of "constituted value".



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"Value is the proportional relation of the products which constitute

wealth."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

Let us note in the first place that the single phrase "relative or exchange

value" implies the idea of some relation in which products are exchanged

reciprocally. By giving the name "proportional relation" to this relation,

no change is made in the relative value, except in the expression. Neither

the depreciation nor the enhancement of the value of a product destroys

its quality of being in some "proportional relation" with the other products

which constitute wealth.



<P>&nbsp;Why then this new term, which introduces no new idea?



<P>&nbsp;"Proportional relation" suggests many other economic relations,

such as proportionality in production, the true proportion between supply

and demand, etc., and M. Proudhon is thinking of all that when he formulates

this didactic paraphrase of marketable value.



<P>&nbsp;In the first place, the relative value of products being determined

by the comparative amount of labor used in the production of each of them,

proportional relations, applied to this special case, stand for the respective

quota of products which can be manufactured in a given time, and which

in consequence are given in exchange for one another.



<P>&nbsp;Let us see what advantage M. Proudhon draws from this proportional

relation.



<P>&nbsp;Everyone knows that when supply and demand are evenly balanced,

the relative value of any product is accurately determined by the quantity

of labor embodied in it, that is to say, that this relative value expresses

the proportional relation precisely in the sense we have just attached

to it. M. Proudhon inverts the order of thing. Begin, he says, by measuring

the relative value of a product by the quantity of labor embodied in it,

and supply and demand will infallibly balance one another. Production will

correspond to consumption, the product will always be exchangeable. Its

current price will express exactly its true value. Instead of saying like

everyone else: when the weather is fine, a lot of people are to be seen

going out for a walk. M. Proudhon makes his people go out for a walk in

order to be able to ensure them fine weather.



<P>&nbsp;What M. Proudhon gives as the consequence of marketable value

determined a priori by labor time could be justified only by a law couched

more or less in the following terms:



<P>&nbsp;Products will in future be exchanged in the exact ratio of the

labor time they have cost. Whatever may be the proportion of supply to

demand, the exchange of commodities will always be made as if they had

been produced proportionately to the demand. Let M. Proudhon take it upon

himself to formulate and lay down such a law, and we shall relieve him

of the necessity of giving proofs. If, on the other hand, he insists on

justifying his theory, not as a legislator, but as an economist, he will

have to prove that the time needed to create a commodity indicates exactly

the degree of its utility and marks its proportional relation to the demand,

and in consequence, to the total amount of wealth. In this case, if a product

is sold at a price equal to its cost of production, supply and demand will

always be evenly balanced; for the cost of production is supposed to express

the true relation between supply and demand.



<P>&nbsp;Actually, M. Proudhon sets out to prove that labor time needed

to create a product indicates its true proportional relation to needs,

so that the things whose production costs the least time are the most immediately

useful, and so on, step by step. The mere production of a luxury object

proves at once, according to this doctrine, that society has spare time

which allows it to satisfy a need for luxury.



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon finds the very proof of his thesis in the observation

that the most useful things cost the least time to produce, that society

always begins with the easiest industries and successively "starts on the

production of objects which cost more labor time and which correspond to

a higher order of needs."



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon borrows from M. Dunoyer the example of extractive

industry -- fruit-gathering, pasturage, hunting, fishing, etc. -- which

is the simplest, the least costly of industries, and the one by which man

began "the first day of his second creation". The first day of his first

creation is recorded in Genesis, which shows God as the world's first manufacturer.



<P>&nbsp;Things happen in quite a different way from what M. Proudhon imagines.

The very moment civilization begins, production begins to be founded on

the antagonism of orders, estates, classes, and finally on the antagonism

of accumulated labor and actual labor. No antagonism, no progress. This

is the law that civilization has followed up to our days. Till now the

productive forces have been developed by virtue of this system of class

antagonisms. To say now that, because all the needs of all the workers

were satisfied, men could devote themselves to the creation of products

of a higher order -- to more complicated industries -- would be to leave

class antagonism out of account and turn all historical development upside

down. It is like saying that because, under the Roman emperors, muraena

were fattened in artificial fishponds, therefore there was enough to feed

abundantly the whole Roman population. Actually, on the contrary, the Roman

people had not enough to buy bread with, while the Roman aristocrats had

slaves enough to throw as fodder to the muraena.



<P>&nbsp;The price of food has almost continuously risen, while the price

of manufactured and luxury goods has almost continuously fallen. Take the

agricultural industry itself; the most indispensable objects, like corn,

meat, etc., rise in price, while cotton, sugar, coffee, etc., fall in a

surprising proportion. And even among comestibles proper, the luxury articles,

like artichokes, asparagus, etc., are today relatively cheaper than foodstuffs

of prime necessity. In our age, the superfluous is easier to produce than

the necessary. Finally, at different historical epochs, the reciprocal

price relations are not only different, but opposed to one another. In

the whole of the Middle Ages, agricultural products were relatively cheaper

than manufactured products; in modern times they are in inverse ratio.

Does this mean that the utility of agricultural products has diminished

since the Middle Ages?



<P>&nbsp;The use of products is determined by the social conditions in

which the consumers find themselves placed, and these conditions themselves

are based on class antagonism.



<P>&nbsp;Cotton, potatoes and spirits are objects of the most common use.

Potatoes have engendered scrofula; cotton has to a great extent driven

out flax and wool, although wool and flax are, in many cases, of greater

utility, if only from the point of view of hygiene; finally, spirits have

got the upper hand of beer and wine, although spirits used as an alimentary

substance are everywhere recognized to be poison. For a whole century,

governments struggled in vain against the European opium; economics prevailed,

and dictated its orders to consumption.



<P>&nbsp;Why are cotton, potatoes and spirits the pivots of bourgeois society?

Because the least amount of labor is needed to produce them, and, consequently,

they have the lowest price. Why does the minimum price determine the maximum

consumption? Is it by any chance because of the absolute utility of these

objects, their intrinsic utility, their utility insomuch as they correspond,

in the most useful manner, in the needs of the worker as a man, and not

to the man as a worker? No, it is because in a society founded on poverty

the poorest products have the fatal prerogative of being used by the greatest

number.



<P>&nbsp;To say now that because the least costly things are in greater

use, they must be of greater utility, is saying that the wide use of spirits,

because of their low cost of production, is the most conclusive proof of

their utility; it is telling the proletarian that potatoes are more wholesome

for him than meat; it is accepting the present state of affairs; it is,

in short, making an apology, with M. Proudhon, for a society without understanding

it.



<P>&nbsp;In a future society, in which class antagonism will have ceased,

in which there will no longer be any classes, use will no longer be determined

by the minimum time of production; but the time of production devoted to

different articles will be determined by the degree of their social utility.



<P>&nbsp;To return to M. Proudhon's thesis: the moment the labor time necessary

for the production of an article ceases to be the expression of its degree

of utility, the exchange value of this same article, determined beforehand

by the labor time embodied in it, becomes quite usable to regulate the

true relation of supply to demand, that is, the proportional relation in

the sense M. Proudhon at the moment attributes to it.



<P>&nbsp;It is not the sale of a given product at the price of its cost

of production that constitutes the "proportional relation" of supply to

demand, or the proportional quota of this product relatively to the sum

total of production; it is the variations in supply and demand that show

the producer what amount of a given commodity he must produce in order

to receive in exchange at least the cost of production. And as these variations

are continually occurring, there is also a continual movement of withdrawl

and application of capital in the different branches of industry.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"It is only in consequence of such variations that capital is apportioned

precisely, in the requisite abundance and no more, to the production of

the different commodities which happen to be in demand. With the rise or

fall of price, profits are elevated above, or depressed below their general

level, and capital is either encouraged to enter into, or is warned to

depart from, the particular employment in which the variation has taken

place." --



<P>&nbsp;"When we look at the markets of a large town, and observe how

regularly they are supplied both with home and foreign commodities, in

the quantity in which they are required, under all the circumstances of

varying demand, arising from the caprice of taste, or a change in the amount

of population, without often producing either the effects of a glut from

a too abundant supply, or an enormously high price from the supply being

unequal to the demand, we must confess that the principle which apportions

capital to each trade in the precise amount that is required, is more active

than is generally supposed."

If M. Proudhon admits that the value of products is determined by labor

time, he should equally admit that it is the fluctuating movement alone

that in society founded on individual exchanges make labor the measure

of value. There is no ready-made constituted "proportional relation", but

only a constituting movement.



<P>&nbsp;We have just seen in what sense it is correct to speak of "proportion"

as of a consequence of value determined by labor time. We shall see now

how this measure by time, called by M. Proudhon the "law of proportion",

becomes transformed into a law of <I>disproportion</I>.



<P>&nbsp;Every new invention that enables the production in one hour of

that which has hitherto been produced in two hours depreciates all similar

products on the market. Competition forces the producer to sell the product

of two hours as cheaply as the product of one hour. Competition carries

into effect the law according to which the relative value of a product

is determined by the labor time needed to produce it. Labor time serving

as the measure of marketable value becomes in this way the law of the continual

depreciation of labor. We will say more. There will be depreciation not

only of the commodities brought into the market, but also of the instruments

of production and of whole plants. This fact was already pointed out by

Ricardo when he said:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

diminish the value of some of the commodities before produced."

Sismondi goes further. He sees in this "value constituted" by labor time,

the source of all the contradictions of modern industry and commerce.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"Mercantile value," he says, "is always determined in the long run

by the quantity of labor needed to obtain the thing evaluated: it is not

what it has actually cost, but what it would cost in the future with, perhaps,

perfected means; and this quantity, although difficult to evaluate, is

always faithfully established by competition....



<P>&nbsp;"It is on this basis that the demand of the seller as well as

the supply of the buyer is reckoned. The former will perhaps declare that

the thing has cost him 10 days' labor; but if the latter realizes that

it can henceforth be produced with eight days' labor, in the event of competition

proving this to the two contracting parties, the value will be reduced,

and the market price fixed at eight days only. Of course, each of the parties

believes that the thing is useful, that it is desired, that without desire

there would be no sale; but the fixing of the price has nothing to do with

utility."

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>(<I>Etudes, etc.</I>, Vol.II, p.267)



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

It is important to emphasize the point that what determines value is not

the time taken to produce a thing, but the minimum time it could possibly

be produced in, and the minimum is ascertained by competition. Suppose

for a moment that there is no more competition and consequently no longer

any means to ascertain the minimum of labor necessary for the production

of a commodity; what will happen? It will suffice to spend six hours' on

the production of an object, in order to have the right, according to M.

Proudhon, to demand in exchange six times as much as the one who has taken

only one hour to produce the same object.



<P>&nbsp;Instead of a "proportional relation", we have a disproportional

relation, at any rate if we insist on sticking to relations, good or bad.



<P>&nbsp;The continual depreciation of labor is only one side, one consequence

of the evaluation of commodities by labor time. The excessive raising of

prices, overproduction and many other features of industrial anarchy have

their explanation in this mode of evaluation.



<P>&nbsp;But does labor time used as a measure of value give rise at least

to the proportional variety of products that so delights M. Proudhon?



<P>&nbsp;On the contrary, monopoly in all its monotony follows in its wake

and invades the world of products, just as to everybody's knowledge monopoly

invades the world of the instruments of production. It is only in a few

branches of industry, like the cotton industry, that very rapid progress

can be made. The natural consequence of this process is that the products

of cotton manufacture, for instance, fall rapidly in price: but as the

price of cotton goes down, the price of flax will be replaced by cotton.

In this way, flax has been driven out of almost the whole of North America.

And we have obtained, instead of the proportional variety of products,

the dominance of cotton.



<P>&nbsp;What is left of this "proportional relation"? Nothing but the

pious wish of an honest man who would like commodities to be produced in

proportions which would permit of their being sold at an honest price.

In all ages good-natured bourgeois and philanthropic economists have taken

pleasure in expressing this innocent wish.



<P>&nbsp;Let us hear what old Boisguillebert says:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"The price of commodities," he says, "must always be proportionate;

for it is such mutual understanding alone that can enable them to exist

together so as to give themselves to one another at any moment (here is

M. Proudhon's continual exchangeability) and reciprocally give birth to

one another....



<P>&nbsp;"As wealth, then, is nothing but this continual intercourse between

man and man, craft and craft, etc., it is a frightful blindness to go looking

for the cause of misery elsewhere than in the cessation of such traffic

brought about by a disturbance of proportion in prices."

<I>Fuit Troja</I>. [Troy is no more.] This true proportion between supply

and demand, which is beginning once more to be the object of so many wishes,

ceased long ago to exist. It has passed into the stage of senility. It

was possible only at a time when the means of production were limited,

when the movement of exchange took place within very restricted bounds.

With the birth of large-scale industry this true proportion had to come

to an end, and production is inevitably compelled to pass in continuous

succession through vicissitudes of prosperity, depression, crisis, stagnation,

renewed prosperity, and so on.



<P>&nbsp;Those who, like Sismondi, wish to return to the true proportion

of production, while preserving the present basis of society, are reactionary,

since, to be consistent, they must also wish to bring back all the other

conditions of industry of former times.



<P>&nbsp;What kept production in true, or more or less true, proportions?

It was demand that dominated supply, that preceded it. Production followed

close on the heels of consumption. Large-scale industry, forced by the

very instruments at its disposal to produce on an ever-increasing scale,

can no longer wait for demand. Production precedes consumption, supply

compels demands.



<P>&nbsp;In existing society, in industry based on individual exchange,

anarchy of production, which is the source of so much misery, is at the

same time the source of all progress.



<P>&nbsp;Thus, one or the other:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>Either you want the true proportions of past centuries with present-day

means of production, in which case you are both reactionary and utopian.



<P>&nbsp;Or you want progress without anarchy: in which case, in order

to preserve the productive forces, you must abandon individual exchange.



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

Individual exchange is suited only to the small-scale industry of past

centuries with its corollary of "true proportion", or else to large-scale

industry with all its train of misery and anarchy.



<P>&nbsp;After all, the determination of value by labor time -- the formula

M. Proudhon gives us as the regenerating formula of the future -- is therefore

merely the scientific expression of the economic relations of present-day

society, as was clearly and precisely demonstrated by Ricardo long before

M. Proudhon.



<P>&nbsp;But does the "equalitarian" application of this formula at least

belong to M. Proudhon? Was he the first to think of reforming society by

transforming all men into actual workers exchanging equal amounts of labor?

Is it really for him to reproach the Communists -- these people devoid

of all knowledge of political economy, these "obstinately foolish men",

these "paradise dreamers" -- with not having found, before him, this "solution

of the problem of the proletariat"?



<P>&nbsp;Anyone who is in any way familiar with the trend of political

economy in England cannot fail to know that almost all the Socialists in

that country have, at different periods, proposed the equalitarian application

of the Ricardian theory. We quote for M. Proudhon: Hodgskin, <I>Political

Economy</I>, 1827; William Thompson, <I>An Inquiry into the Principles

of the Distribution of Wealth Most Conducive to Human Happiness</I>, 1824;

T. R. Edmonds, <I>Practical Moral and Political Economy</I>, 1828 [18],

etc., etc., and four pages more of etc. We shall content ourselves with

listening to an English Communist, Mr. Bray. We shall give the decisive

passages in his remarkable work, <I>Labor's Wrongs and Labor's Remedy</I>,

Leeds, 1839, and we shall dwell some time upon it, firstly, because Mr.

Bray is still little known in France, and secondly, because we think that

we have discovered in him the key to the past, present and future works

of M. Proudhon.

the side of a system of equality.... Every man is a link, in the chain

of effects -- the beginning of which is but an idea, and the end, perhaps,

the production of a piece of cloth. Thus, although we may entertain different

feelings towards the several parties, it does not follow that one should

be better paid for his labor than another. The inventor will ever receive,

in addition to his just pecuniary reward, that which genius only can obtain

from us -- the tribune of our admiration....



<P>&nbsp;"From the very nature of labor and exchange, strict justice not

only requires that all exchangers should be mutually, but that they should

likewise be equally, benefited. Men have only two things which they can

exchange with each other, namely, labor, and the produce of labor....



<P>&nbsp;"If a just system of exchanges were acted upon, the value of articles

would be determined by the entire cost of production; and equal values

should always exchange for equal values. If, for instance, it takes a hatter

one day to make a hat, and a shoemaker the same time to make a pair of

shoes -- supposing the material used by each to be of the same value --

and they exchange these articles with each other, they are not only mutually

but equally benefited: the advantage derived by either party cannot be

a disadvantage to the other, as each has given the same amount of labor,

and the materials made use of by each were of equal value. But if the hatter

should obtain two pair of shoes for one hat -- time and value of material

being as before -- the exchange would clearly be an unjust one. The hatter

would defraud the shoemaker of one day's labor; and were the former to

act thus in all his exchanges, he would receive, for the labor of half

a year, the product of some other person's whole year. We have heretofore

acted upon no other than this most unjust system of exchanges -- the workmen

have given the capitalist the labor of a whole year, in exchange for the

value of only half a year -- and from this, and not from the assumed inequality

of bodily and mental powers in individuals, has arisen the inequality of

wealth and power which at present exists around us. It is an inevitable

condition inequality of exchanges -- of buying at one price and selling

at another -- that capitalists shall continue to be capitalists, and working

men to be working men -- the one a class of tyrants and the other a class

of slaves -- to eternity....

will be no more than the accumulated produce of his own labor. He may exchange

his wealth, or he may give it to others... but a rich man cannot continue

wealthy for any length of time after he has ceased to labor. Under equality

of exchanges, wealth cannot have, as it now has, a procreative and apparently

self-generating power, such as replenishes all waste from consumption;

for, unless it be renewed by labor, wealth, when once consumed, is given

up for ever. That which is now called profit and interest cannot exist

as such in connection with equality of exchanges; for producer and distributor

would be alike remunerated, and the sum total of their labor would determine

the value of the article created and brought to the hands of the consumer....

an indefinite number of smaller sections, all working, producing and exchanging

their products on a footing of the most perfect equality....



<P>&nbsp;"And the joint-stock modification (which is nothing but a concession

to present-day society in order to obtain communism), by being so constituted

as to admit of individual property in productions in connection with a

common property in productive powers -- making every individual dependent

on his own exertions, and at the same time allowing him an equal participation

in every advantage afforded by nature and art -- is fitted to take society

We now only need to reply in a few words to Mr. Bray who without us and

in spite of us had managed to supplant M. Proudhon, except that Mr. Bray,

far from claiming the last word on behalf of humanity, proposes merely

measures which he think good for a period of transition between existing

society and a community regime.



<P>&nbsp;One hour of Peter's labor exchanges for one hour of Paul's labor.

That is Mr. Bray's fundamental axiom.



<P>&nbsp;Let us suppose Peter has 12 hours' labor before him, and Paul

only six. Peter will consequently have six hours' labor left over. What

will he do with these six hours' labor?



<P>&nbsp;Either he will do nothing with them -- in which case he will have

worked six hours for nothing; or else he will remain idle for another six

hours to get even; or else, as a last resource, he will give these six

hours' labor, which he has no use for, to Paul into the bargain.



<P>&nbsp;What in the end will Peter have earned more than Paul? Some hours

of labor? No! He will have gained only hours of leisure; he will be forced

to play the loafer for six hours. And in order that this new right to loaf

might be not only relished but sought after in the new society, this society

would have to find in idleness its highest bliss, and to look upon labor

as a heavy shackle from which it must break free at all costs.



<P>&nbsp;And indeed, to return to our example, if only these hours of leisure

that Peter had gained in excess of Paul were really a gain! Not in the

least. Paul, beginning by working only six hours, attains by steady and

regular work a result that Peter secures only by beginning with an excess

of work. Everyone will want to be Paul, there will be a competition to

occupy Paul's position, a competition in idleness.



<P>&nbsp;Well, then! What has the exchange of equal quantities of labor

brought us? Overproduction, depreciation, excess of labor followed by unemployment;

in short, economic relations such as we see in present-day society, minus

the competition of labor.



<P>&nbsp;No! We are wrong! These is still an expedient which may save this

new society of Peters and Pauls. Peter will consume by himself the product

of the six hours' labor which he has left. But from the moment he has no

longer to exchange because he has produced, he has no need to produce for

exchange; and the whole hypothesis of a society founded on the exchange

and division of labor will fall to the ground. Equality of exchange will

have been saved by the simple fact that exchange will have ceased to be:

Paul and Peter would arrive at the position of Robinson.



<P>&nbsp;Thus, if all the members of society are supposed to be actual

workers, the exchange of equal quantities of hours of labor is possible

only on condition that the number of hours to be spent on material production

is agreed on before hand. But such an agreement negates individual exchange.



<P>&nbsp;We still come to the same result, if we take as our starting point

not the distribution of the products created but the act of production.

In large-scale industry, Peter is not free to fix for himself the time

of his labor, for Peter's labor is nothing without the co-operation of

all the Peters and all the Pauls who make up the workshop. This explains

very well the dogged resistance which the English factory owners put up

to the Ten Hours' Bill. They knew only too well that a two-hours' reduction

of labor granted to women and children <A HREF="#n5">[5]</A> would carry

with it an equal reduction of working hours for adult men. It is in the

nature of large-scale industry that working hours should be equal for all.

What is today the result of capital and the competition of workers among

themselves will be tomorrow, if you sever the relation between labor and

capital, an actual agreement based upon the relation between the sum of

productive forces and the sum of existing needs.



<P>&nbsp;But such an agreement is a condemnation of individual exchange,

and we are back again at our first conclusion!



<P>&nbsp;In principle, there is no exchange of products -- but there is

the exchange of the labor which co-operated in production. The mode of

exchange of products depends upon the mode of exchange of the productive

forces. In general, the form of exchange of products corresponds to the

form of production. Change the latter, and the former will change in consequence.

Thus in the history of society we see that the mode of exchanging products

is regulated by the mode of producing them. Individual exchange corresponds

also to a definite mode of production which itself corresponds to class

antagonisM. There is thus no individual exchange without the antagonism

of classes.



<P>&nbsp;But the respectable conscience refuses to see this obvious fact.

So long as one is a bourgeois, one cannot but see in this relation of antagonism

a relation of harmony and eternal justice, which allows no one to gain

at the expense of another. For the bourgeois, individual exchange can exist

without any antagonism of classes. For him, these are two quite unconnected

thing. Individual exchange, as the bourgeois conceives it, is far from

resembling individual exchange as it actually exists in practice.



<P>&nbsp;Mr. Bray turns the illusion of the respectable bourgeois into

an ideal he would like to attain. In a purified individual exchange, freed

from all the elements of antagonism he finds in it, he sees an "equalitarian"

relation which he would like society to adopt generally.



<P>&nbsp;Mr. Bray does not see that this equalitarian relation, this corrective

ideal that he would like to apply to the world, is itself nothing but the

reflection of the actual world; and that therefore it is totally impossible

to reconstitute society on the basis of what is merely an embellished shadow

of it. In proportion as this shadow takes on substance again, we perceive

that this substance, far from being the transfiguration dreamt of, is the

actual body of existing society. <A HREF="#n6">[6]</A>

</TABLE></CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>hus, gold and silver are the first applications of

"value constituted" ... by M. Proudhon. And as M. Proudhon constitutes

the value of products determining it by th e comparative amount of labor

embodied in them, the only thing he had to do was to prove that variations

in the value of gold and silver are always explained by variations in the

labor time taken to produce them. M. Proudhon has no intention of doing

so. He speaks of gold and silver not as commodities, but as money.



<P>&nbsp;His only logic, if logic it be, consists in juggling with the

capacity of gold and silver to be used as money for the benefit of all

the commodities which have the property of being evaluated by labor time.

Decidedly there is more naivete than malice in this jugglery.



<P>&nbsp;A useful product, once it has been evaluated by the labor time

needed to produce it, is always acceptable in exchange; witness, cries

M. Proudhon, gold and silver, which exist in my desired conditions of "exchangeability"!

Gold and silver, then, are value which has reached a state of constitution:

they are the incorporation of M. Proudhon's idea. He could not have been

happier in his choice of an example. Gold and silver, apart from their

capacity of being commodities, evaluated like other commodities, in labor

time, have also the capacity of being the universal agents of exchange,

of being money. By now considering gold and silver as an application of

"value constituted" by labor time, nothing is easier than to prove that

all commodities whose value is constituted by labor time will always be

exchangeable, will be money.



<P>&nbsp;A very simple question occurs to M. Proudhon. Why have gold and

silver the privilege of typifying "constituted value"?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"The special function which usage has devolved upon the precious metal,

that of serving as a medium for trade, is purely conventional, and any

other commodity could, less conveniently perhaps, but just as reliably,

fulfil this function. Economists recognize this, and cite more than one

example. What then is the reason for this universal preference for metals

as money? And what is the explanation of this specialization of the function

of money -- which has no analogy in political economy?... Is it possible

to reconstruct the series from which money seems to have broken away, and

hence to trace it back to its true principle?"&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>[I 68-69]



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

Straight away, by formulating the question in these terms, M. Proudhon

has presupposed the existence of <I>money</I>. The first question he should

have asked himself was, why, in exchanges as they are actually constituted,

it has been necessary to individualize exchangeable value, so to speak,

by the creation of a special agent of exchange. Money is not a thing, it

is a social relation. Why is the money relation a production relation like

any other economic relation, such as the division of labor, etc.? If M.

Proudhon had properly taken account of this relation, he would not have

seen in money an exception, an element detached from a series unknown or

needing reconstruction.



<P>&nbsp;He would have realized, on the contrary, that this relation is

a link, and, as such, closely connected with a whole chain of other economic

relations; that this relation corresponds to a definite mode of production

neither more nor less than does individual exchange. What does he do? He

starts off by detaching money from the actual mode of production as a whole,

and then makes it the first member of an imaginary series, of a series

to be reconstructed.



<P>&nbsp;Once the necessity for a specific agency of exchange, that is,

for money, has been recognized, all that remains to be explained is why

this particular function has developed upon gold and silver rather than

upon any commodity. This is a secondary question, which is explained not

by the chain of production relations, but by the specific qualities inherent

in gold and silver as substances. If all this has made economists for once

"go outside the domains of their own science, to dabble in physics, mechanics,

history and so on", as M. Proudhon reproaches them with doing, they have

merely done what they were compelled to do. The question was no longer

within the domain of political economy.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

This economic reason which nobody -- with good ground indeed -- has seen

of understood, M. Proudhon has seen, understood and bequeathed to posterity.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"What nobody else has noticed is that, of all commodities, gold and

silver were the first to have their value attain constitution. In the patriarchal

period, gold and silver were still bartered and exchanged in ingots but

even then they showed a visible tendency to become dominant and received

a marked degree of preference. Little by little the sovereigns took possession

of them and affixed their seal to them: and of this sovereign consecration

was born money, that is, the commodity par excellence. which, notwithstanding

all the shocks of commerce, retains a definite proportional value and makes

itself accepted for all payments....



<P>&nbsp;"The distinguishing character of gold and silver is due, I repeat,

to the fact that, thanks to their metallic properties, to the difficulties

of their production, and above all to the intervention of state authority,

they early won stability and authenticity as commodities."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

To say that, of all commodities, gold and silver were the first to have

their value constituted, is to say, after all that has gone before, that

gold and silver were the first to attain the status of money. This is M.

Proudhon's great revelation, this is the truth that none had discovered

before him.



<P>&nbsp;If, by these words, M. Proudhon means that of all commodities,

gold and silver are the ones whose time of production was known the earliest,

this would be yet another of the suppositions with which he is so ready

to regale his readers. If we wished to harp on this patriarchal erudition,

we would inform M. Proudhon that it was the time needed to produce objects

of prime necessity, such as iron, etc., which was the first to be known.

We shall spare him Adam Smith's classic bow.



<P>&nbsp;But, after all that, how can M. Proudhon go on talking about the

constitution of a value, since a value is never constituted by itself?

It is constituted, not by the time needed to produce it by itself, but

in relation to the quota of each and every other product which can be created

in the same time. Thus the constitution of the value of gold and silver

presupposes an already completed constitution of a number of other products.



<P>&nbsp;It is then not the commodity that has attained, in gold and silver,

the status of "constituted value", it is M. Proudhon's "constituted value"

that has attained, in gold and silver, the status of money.



<P>&nbsp;Let us now make a closer examination of these "economic reasons"

which, according to M. Proudhon, have bestowed upon gold and silver the

advantage of being raised to the status of money sooner than other products,

thanks to their having passed through the constitutive phase of value.



<P>&nbsp;These economic reasons are: the "visible tendency to become dominant",

the "marked preferences" even in the "patriarchal period", and other circumlocutions

about the actual fact -- which increase the difficulty, since they multiply

the fact by multiplying the incidents which M. Proudhon brings in to explain

the fact. M. Proudhon has not yet exhausted all the so-called economic

reasons. Here is one of sovereign, irresistible force:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"Money is born of sovereign consecration: the sovereigns take possession

of gold and silver and affix their seal to them."&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>[I 69]



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

Thus, the whim of sovereigns is for M. Proudhon the highest reason in political

economy.



<P>&nbsp;Truly, one must be destitute of all historical knowledge not to

know that it is the sovereigns who in all ages have been subject to economic

conditions, but they have never dictated laws to theM. Legislation, whether

political or civil, never does more than proclaim, express in words, the

will of economic relations.



<P>&nbsp;Was it the sovereign who took possession of gold and silver to

make them the universal agents of exchange by affixing his seal to them?

Or was it not, rather, these universal agents of exchange which took possession

of the sovereign and forced him to affix his seal to them and thus give

them a political consecration?



<P>&nbsp;The impress which was and is still given to money is not that

of its value but of its weight. The stability and authenticity M. Proudhon

speaks of apply only to the standard of the money ; and this standard indicates

how much metallic matter there is in a coined piece of money.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TD>"The sole intrinsic value of a silver mark," says Voltaire, with his

But the question: how much is an ounce of gold or silver worth, remains

<TD>"Philip I, King of France," says M. Proudhon, "mixes with Charlemagne's

gold pound a third of alloy, imagining that, having the monopoly of the

manufacture of money, he could do what is done by every manufacture of

money, he could do what is done by every tradesman who has the the monopoly

of a product. What was actually this debasement of the currency from which

Philip and his successors have been so much blamed? It was perfectly sound

reasoning from the point of view of commercial practice, but very unsound

economic science, viz., to suppose that, as supply and demand regulate

value, it is possible, either by producing an artificial scarcity or by

monopolizing manufacture, to increase the estimation and consequently the

value of things; and that this is true of gold and silver as of corn, wine,

oil or tobacco. But Philip's fraud was no sooner suspected than his money

was reduced to its true value, and he himself lost what he had thought

to gain from his subjects. The same thing has happened as a result of every

similar attempt."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>[I 70-71]



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

It has been probed times without number that, if a prince takes into his

head to debase the currency, it is he who loses. What he gains once at

the first issue he loses every time the falsified coinage returns to him

in the form of taxes, etc. But Philip and his successors were able to protect

themselves more or less against this loss, for, once the debased coinage

was put into circulation, they hastened to order a general re-minting of

money on the old footing.



<P>&nbsp;And besides, if Philip I had really reasoned like M. Proudhon,

he would not have reasoned well "from the commercial point of view". Neither

Philip I nor M. Proudhon displays any mercantile genius in imagining that

it is possible to alter the value of gold as well as that of every other

commodity merely because their value is determined by the relation between

supply and demand.



<P>&nbsp;If King Philip had decreed that one quarter of wheat was in future

to be called two quarters of wheat, he would have been a swindler. He would

have deceived all the rentiers, all the people who were entitled to receive

100 quarters of wheat. He would have been the cause of all these people

receiving only 50 quarters of wheat; he would have had to pay only 50.

But in commerce 100 such quarters would never have been worth more than

50. By changing the name we do not change the thing. The quantity of wheat,

whither supplied or demanded, will be neither decreased nor increased by

this mere change of name. Thus, the relation between supply and demand

being just the same in spite of this change of name, the price of wheat

will undergo no real change. When we speak of the supply and demand of

things, we do not speak of the supply and demand of the name of things.

Philip I was not a maker of gold and silver, as M. Proudhon says; he was

a maker of names for coins. Pass off your French cashmeres as Asiatic cashmeres,

and you may deceive a buyer or two; but once the fraud becomes known, your

so-called Asiatic cashmeres will drop to the price of French cashmeres.

When he put a false label on gold and silver, King Philip could deceive

only so long as the fraud was not known. Like any other shopkeeper, he

deceived his customers by a false description of his wares, which could

not last for long. He was bound sooner or later to suffer the rigour of

commercial laws. Is this what M. Proudhon wanted to prove? No. According

to him, it is from the sovereign and not from commerce that money gets

its value. And what has he really proved? That commerce is more sovereign

than the sovereign. Let the sovereign decree that one mark shall in future

be two marks, commerce will keep on saying that these two marks are worth

no more than one mark was formerly.



<P>&nbsp;But, for all that, the question of value determined by the quantity

of labor has not been advanced a step. It still remains to be decided whether

the value of these two marks (which have become what one mark was once)

is determined by the cost of production or by the law of supply and demand.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>M. Proudhon continues: "It should even be borne in mind that if, instead

of debasing the currency, it had been in the king's power to double its

bulk, the exchange value of gold and silver would immediately have dropped

by half, always from reasons of proportion and equilibrium."

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>[I 71]

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

If this opinion, which M. Proudhon shares with the other economists, is

valid, it argues in favor of the latter's doctrine of supply and demand,

and in no way in favor of M. Proudhon's proportionality. For, whatever

the quantity of labor embodied in the doubled bulk of gold and silver,

its value would have dropped by half, the demand having remained the same

and the supply having doubled. Or can it be, by any chance, that the "law

of proportionality" would have become confused this time with the so much

disdained law of supply and demand? This true proportion of M. Proudhon's

is indeed so elastic, is capable of so many variations, combination and

permutations, that it might well coincide for once with the relation between

supply and demand.



<P>&nbsp;To make "every commodity acceptable in exchange, if not in practice

then at least by right", on the basis of the role of gold and silver is,

then, to misunderstand this role. Gold and silver are acceptable by right

only because they are acceptable in practice; and they are acceptable in

practice because the present organization of production needs a universal

medium of exchange. Right is only the official recognition of fact.



<P>&nbsp;We have seen that the example of money as an application of value

which has attained constitution was chosen by M. Proudhon only to smuggle

through his whole doctrine of exchangeability, that is to say, to prove

that every commodity assessed by its cost of production must attain the

status of money. All this would be very fine, were it not for the awkward

fact that precisely gold and silver, as money, are of all commodities the

only ones not determined by their cost of production; and this is so true

that in circulation they can be replaced by paper. So long as there is

a certain proportion observed between the requirements of circulation and

the amount of money issued, be it paper, gold, platinum, or copper money,

there can be no question of a proportion to be observed between the intrinsic

value (cost of production) and the nominal value of money. Doubtless, in

international trade, money is determined, like any other commodity, by

labor time. But it is also true that gold and silver in international trade

are means of exchange as products and not as money. In other words, they

lose this characteristic of "stability and authenticity", of "sovereign

consecration", which, for M. Proudhon, forms their specific characteristic.

Ricardo understood the truth so well that, after basing his whole system

on value determined by labor time, and after saying:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"Gold and silver, like all other commodities, are valuable only in

proportion to the quantity of labor necessary to produce them, and bring

them to market",



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

he adds, nevertheless, that the value of <I>money</I> is not determined

by the labor time its substance embodies, but by the law of supply and

demand only.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"Though it [paper money] has no intrinsic value, yet, by limiting its

quantity, its value in exchange is as great as an equal denomination of

coin, or of bullion in that coin. On the same principle, too, namely, by

limitation of its quantity, a debased coin would circulate at the value

it should bear, if it were of the legal weight and fineness, and not at

the value of the quantity of metal which it actually contained. In the

history of the British coinage, we find, accordingly, that the currency

was never depreciated in the same proportion that it was debased; the reason

of which was, that it never was increased in quantity, in proportion to

its diminished intrinsic value."

<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

</TABLE></CENTER>

Thus money, which for Ricardo is no longer a value determined by labor

time, and which J. B. Say therefore takes as an example to convince Ricardo

that the other values could not be determined by labor time either, this

money, I say, taken by J. B. Say as an example of a value determined exclusively

by supply and demand, becomes for M. Proudhon the example par excellence

of the application of value constituted... by labor time.



<P>&nbsp;To conclude, if money is not a value "constituted" by labor time,

it is all the less likely that it could have anything in common with M.

Proudhon's true "proportion". Gold and silver are always exchangeable,

because they have the special function of serving as the universal agent

of exchange, and in no wise because they exist in a quantity proportional

to the sum total of wealth; or, to put it still better, they are always

proportional because, alone of all commodities, they serve as money, the

universal agent of exchange, whatever their quantity in relation to the

sum total of wealth.

true: it is the corollary of the law of proportion, which may be regarded

To prove that all labor must leave a surplus, M. Proudhon personifies society;

he turns it into a person, Society -- a society which is not by any means

a society of persons, since it has its law apart, which have nothing in

common with the persons of which society is composed, and its "own intelligence",

which is not the intelligence of common men, but an intelligence devoid

of common sense. M. Proudhon reproaches the economists with not having

understood the personality of this collective being. We have pleasure in

confronting him with the following passage from an American economist,

who accuses the economists of just the opposite:

Does M. Proudhon mean thereby merely that the production of the social

individual exceeds that of the isolated individual? Is M. Proudhon referring

to this excess of the production of associated individuals over that of

non-associated individuals? If so, we could quote for him a hundred economists

who have expressed this simple truth without any of the mysticism with

which M. Proudhon surrounds himself. This, for example, is what Mr. Sadler

says:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TD>"Combined labor produces results which individual exertion could never

accomplish. As mankind, therefore, multiply in number, the products of

their united industry would greatly exceed the amount of any mere arithmetical

a solitary... individual could perform in his whole life.... Geometry says...

that the whole is only equal to the sum of all its parts; as applied to

the subject before us, this axiom would be false. Regarding labor, the

great pillar of human existence, it may be said that the entire product

of combined exertion almost infinitely exceeds all which individual and

disconnected efforts could possibly accomplish."

To return to M. Proudhon. Surplus labor, he says, is explained by the person,

Society. The life of this person is guided by laws, the opposite of those

which govern the activities of man as an individual. He desires to prove

this by "facts".



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TD>"The discovery of an economic process can never provide the inventor

with a profit equal to that which he procures for society.... It has been

remarked that railway enterprises are much less a source of wealth for

the contractors than for the state.... The average cost of transporting

commodities by road is 18 centimes per ton per kilometre, from the collection

of the goods to their delivery. It has been calculated that at this rate

an ordinary railway enterprise would not obtain 10 per cent net profit,

a result approximately equal to that of a road-transport enterprise. But

let us suppose that the speed of rail transport compared with that of road

transport is as 4 is to 1. Since in society time is value itself, the railway

would, prices being equal, present an advantage of 400 per cent over road-transport.

Yet this enormous advantage, very real for society, is far from being realized

in the same proportion for the carrier, who, while bestowing upon society

an extra value of 400 per cent, does not for his own part draw 10 per cent.

To bring the matter home still more pointedly, let us suppose, in fact,

that the railway puts up its rate to 25 centimes, the cost of road transport

remaining at 18: it would instantly lose all its consignments. Senders,

receivers, everybody would return to the van, to the primitive waggon if

necessary. The locomotive would be abandoned. A social advantage of 400

per cent would be sacrificed to a private loss of 35 per cent. The reason

for this is easily grasped: the advantage resulting from the speed of the

railway is entirely social, and each individual participates in it only

in a minute proportion (it must be remembered that at the moment we are

dealing only with the transport of goods), while the loss strikes the consumer

directly and personally. A social profit equal to 400 represents for the

individual, if society is composed only of a million men, four ten-thousandths;

while a loss of 33 per cent for the consumer would suppose a social deficit

of 33 million.&nbsp;</TD>

</TABLE></CENTER>

Now, we may even overlook the fact that M. Proudhon expresses a quadrupled

speed as 400 per cent of the original speed; but that he should bring into

relation the percentage of speed and the percentage of profit and establish

a proportion between two relations which, although measured separately

by percentages, are nevertheless incommensurate with each other, is to

establish a proportion between the percentages without reference to denominations.



<P>&nbsp;Percentages are always percentages, 10 per cent and 400 per cent

are commensurable; they are to each other as 10 is to 400. Therefore, concludes

M. Proudhon, a profit of 10 per cent is worth 40 times less than a quadrupled

speed. To save appearances, he says that, for society, time is money. This

error arises from his recollecting vaguely that there is a connection between

labor value and labor time, and he hastens to identify labor time with

transport time; that is, he identifies the few firemen, drivers and others,

whose labor time is actually transport time, with the whole of society.

Thus at one blow, speed has become capital, and in this case he is fully

right in saying: "A profit of 400 per cent will be sacrificed to a loss

of 35 per cent." After establishing this strange proposition as a mathematician,

he gives us the explanation of it as an economist.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TD>"A social profit equal to 400 represents for the individual, in a society

of only a million men, 4/10,000ths."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

Agreed; but we are dealing not with 400, but with 400 per cent, and a profit

of 400 per cent represents for the individual 400 per cent, neither more

nor less. Whatever be the capital, the dividends will always be in the

ratio of 400 per cent. What does M. Proudhon do? He takes percentages for

capital, and, as if he were afraid of his confusion not being manifest

enough, "pointed" enough, he continues:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"A loss of 33 per cent for the consumer would suppose a social deficit

of 33 million."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

A loss of 33 per cent for the consumer remains a loss of 33 per cent for

a million consumers. How then can M. Proudhon say pertinently that the

social deficit in the case of a 33 per cent loss amounts to 33 million,

when he knows neither the social capital nor even the capital of a single

one of the persons concerned? Thus it was not enough for M. Proudhon to

have confused capital with percentage; he surpasses himself by identifying

the capital sunk in an enterprise with the number of interested parties.



<P>&nbsp;"To bring the matter home still more pointedly let us suppose

in fact" a given capital. A social profit of 400 per cent divided among

a million participants, each of them interested to the extent of 1 franc,

would give 4 francs profit per head -- and not 0.0004, as M. Proudhon alleges.

Likewise a loss of 33 per cent for each of the participants represents

a social deficit of 330,000 francs and not of 33 million (100:33 = 1,000,000:330,000).



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon, preoccupied with his theory of the person, Society,

forgets to divide by 100, which entails a loss of 330,000 francs; but 4

francs profit per head make 4 million francs profit for society. There

remains for society a net profit of 3,670,000 francs. This accurate calculation

proves precisely the contrary of what M. Proudhon wanted to prove: namely,

that the profits and losses of society are not in inverse ratio to the

profits and losses of individuals.



<P>&nbsp;Having rectified these simple errors of pure calculation, let

us take a look at the consequences which we would arrive at, if we admitted

this relation between speed and capital in the case of railways, as M.

Proudhon gives it -- minus the mistakes in calculation. Let us suppose

that a transport four times as rapid costs four times as much; this transport

would not yield less profit than cartage, which is four times slower and

costs a quarter the amount. Thus, if cartage takes 18 centimes, rail transport

could take 72 centimes. This would be, according to "the rigor of mathematics",

the consequence of M. Proudhon's suppositions -- always minus his mistakes

in calculation. But here he is all of a sudden telling us the if, instead

of 72 centimes, rail transport takes only 25, it would instantly lose all

its consignments. Decidedly we should have to go back to the van, to the

primitive waggon even. Only, if we have any advice to give M. Proudhon,

it is not to forget, in his <I>Programme of the Progressive Association</I>,

to divide by 100. But, alas! it is scarcely to be hoped that our advice

will be listened to, for M. Proudhon is so delighted with his "progressive

association", that he cries most emphatically:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"I have already shown in Chapter II, by the solution of the antinomy

of value, that the advantage of every useful discovery is incomparably

less for the inventor, whatever he may do, than for society. I have carried

the demonstration in regard to this point in the rigor of mathematics!"



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

Let us return to the fiction of the person, Society, a fiction which has

no other aim than that of proving this simple truth -- that a new invention

which enables a given amount of labor to produce a greater number of commodities,

lowers the marketable value of the product. Society, then, makes a profit,

not by obtaining more exchange values, but by obtaining more commodities

for the same value. As for the inventor, competition makes his profit fall

successively to the general level of profits. Has M. Proudhon proved this

proposition as he wanted to? No. This does not prevent him from reproaching

the economists with failure to prove it. To prove to him on the contrary

that they <I>have</I> proved it, we shall cite only Ricardo and Lauderdale

-- Ricardo, the head of the school which determines value by labor time,

and Lauderdale, one of the most uncompromising defenders of the determination

of value by supply and demand. Both have expounded the same proposition:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"By constantly increasing the facility of production, we constantly

diminish the value of some of the commodities before produced, though by

the same means we not only add to the national riches, but also to the

power of future production.... As soon as by the aid of machinery, or by

the knowledge of natural philosophy, you oblige natural agents to do the

work which was before done by man, the exchangeable value of such work

falls accordingly. If 10 men turned a corn mill, and it be discovered that

by the assistance of wind, or of water, the labor of these 10 men may be

spared, the flour which is the produce partly of the work performed by

the mill, would immediately fall in value, in proportion to the quantity

of labor saved; and the society would be richer by the commodities which

the labor of the 10 men could produce, the funds destined for their maintenance

being in no degree impaired."

</TABLE></CENTER>

Lauderdale, in his turn, says:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>In every instance where capital is so employed as to produce a profit,

it uniformly arises, either -- from its supplanting a portion of labor,

which would otherwise be performed by the hand of man; or -- from its performing

a portion of labor, which is beyond the reach of the personal exertion

of man to accomplish. The small profit which the proprietors of machinery

generally acquire, when compared with the wages of labor, which the machine

supplants, may perhaps create a suspicion of the rectitude of this opinion.

Some fire-engines, for instance, draw more water from a coalpit in one

day than could be conveyed on the shoulder of 300 men, even assisted by

the machinery of buckets; and a fire-engine undoubtedly performs its labor

at a much smaller expense than the amount of the wages of those whose labor

it thus supplants. This is, in truth, the case with all machinery. All

machines must execute the labor that was antecedently performed at a cheaper

rate than it could be done by the hand of man....



<P>&nbsp;If such a privilege is given for the invention of a machine, which

performs, by the labor of one man, a quantity of work that used to take

the labor of four; as the possession of the exclusive privilege prevents

any competition in doing the work, but what proceeds from the labor of

the workmen, their wages, as long as the patent continues, must obviously

form the measure of the patentee's charge; that is to secure employment,

he has only to charge a little less than the wages of the labor which the

machine supplants. But when the patent expires, other machines of the same

nature are brought into competition; and then his charge must be regulated

on the same principle as every other, according to the abundance of machines....



<P>&nbsp;The profit of capital employed..., though it arises from supplanting

labor, comes to be regulated, not by the value of the labor it supplants

but, as in all other cases, by the competition among the proprietors of

capital that presents itself for performing the duty, and the demand for

it.

Finally, then, so long as the profit is greater than in other industries,

capital will be thrown into the new industry until the rate of profit falls

to the general level.



<P>&nbsp;We have just seen that the example of the railway was scarcely

suited to throw any light on his fiction of the person, Society. Nevertheless,

M. Proudhon boldly resumes his discourse:



<P>&nbsp;

What now follows belongs to classical antiquity. It is a poetical narrative

intended to refresh the reader after the fatigue which the rigor of the

preceding mathematical demonstrations must have caused him. M. Proudhon

gives the person, Society, the name of Prometheus, whose high deeds he

glorifies in these terms:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>First of all, Prometheus emerging from the bosom of nature awakens

to life, in a delightful inertia, etc., etc. Prometheus sets to work, and

on this first day, the first day of the second creation, Prometheus' product,

that is, his wealth, his well-being, is equal to 10. On the second day,

Prometheus divides his labor, and his product becomes equal to 100. On

the third day and on each of the follow- ing days, Prometheus invents machines,

discovers new util- ities in bodies, new forces in nature.... With every

step of his industrial activity, there is an increase in the number of

his products, which marks an enhancement of hap- piness for hiM. And since,

after all, to consume is for him to produce, it is clear that every day's

consumption, using up only the product of the day before, leaves a surplus

product for the next day."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>[I 77-78]



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

This Prometheus of M. Proudhon's is a queer character, as weak in logic

as in political economy. So long as Prometheus merely teaches us the division

of labor, the application of machinery, the exploitation of natural forces

and scientific power, multiplying the productive forces of men and giving

a surplus compared with the produce of labor in isolation, this new Prometheus

has the misfortune only of coming too late. But the moment Prometheus starts

talking about production and consumption he becomes really ludicrous. To

consume, for him, is to produce; he consumes the next day what he produced

the day before, so that he is always one day in advance; this day in advance

is his "surplus labor". But, if he consumes the next day what he has produced

the day before, he must, on the first day, which had no day before, have

done two days' work in order to be one day in advance later on. How did

Prometheus earn this surplus on the first day, when there was neither division

of labor, nor machinery, nor even any knowledge of physical forces other

than fire? Thus the question, for all its being carried back "to the first

day of the second creation", has not advanced a single step forward. This

way of explaining things savors both of Greek and of Hebrew, it is at once

mystical and allegorical. It gives M. Proudhon a prefect right to say:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"I have proved by theory and by facts the principle that all labor

must have a surplus."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

The "facts" are the famous progressive calculation; the theory is the myth

of Prometheus.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"But," continues M. Proudhon, "this principle, while being as certain

as an arithmetical proposition, is as yet far from being realized by everyone.

Whereas, with the progress of collective industry, every day's individual

labor produces a greater and greater product, and whereas therefore, by

a necessary consequence, the worker with the same wage ought to become

richer every day, there actually exist estates in society which profit

and others which decay."

In 1770 the population of the United Kingdom of Great Britain was 15 million,

and the productive population was 3 million. The scientific power of production

equalled a population of about 12 million individuals more. Therefore there

were, altogether, 15 million of productive forces. Thus the productive

power was to the population as 1 is to 1; and the scientific power was

to the manual power as 4 is to 1.



<P>&nbsp;In 1840 the population did not exceed 30 million: the productive

population was 6 million. But the scientific power amounted to 650 million;

that is, it was to the whole population as 21 is to 1, and to manual power

as 108 is to 1.



<P>&nbsp;In English society the working day thus acquired in 70 a surplus

of 2,700 per cent productivity; that is, in 1840 it produced 27 times as

much as in 1770. According to M. Proudhon, the following question should

be raised: why was not the English worker of 1840 27 times as rich as the

one of 1770? In raising such a question one would naturally be supposing

that the English could have produced this wealth without the historical

conditions in which it was produced, such as: private accumulation of capital,

modern division of labor, automatic workshops, anarchical competition,

the wage system -- in short, everything that is based upon class antagonisM.

Now, these were precisely the necessary conditions of existence for the

development of productive forces and of surplus labor. Therefore, to obtain

this development of productive forces and this surplus labor, there had

to be classes which profited and classes which decayed.



<P>&nbsp;What then, ultimately, is this Prometheus resuscitated by M. Proudhon?

It is society, social relations based on class antagonisM. These relations

are not relations between individual and individual, but between worker

and capitalist, between farmer and landlord, etc. Wipe out these relations

and you annihilate all society, and your Prometheus is nothing but a ghost

without arms or legs; that is, without automatic workshops, without division

of labor -- in a word, without everything that you gave him to start with

in order to make him obtain this surplus labor.



<P>&nbsp;In then, in theory, it sufficed to interpret, as M. Proudhon does,

the formula of surplus labor in the equalitarian sense, without taking

into account the actual conditions of production, it should suffice, in

practice, to share out equally among the workers all the wealth at present

acquired, without changing in any way the present conditions of production.

Such a distribution would certainly not assure a high degree of comfort

to the individual participants.



<P>&nbsp;But M. Proudhon is not so pessimistic as one might think. As proportion

is everything for him, he has to see in his fully equipped Prometheus,

that is, in present-day society, the beginnings of a realization of his

favorite idea.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"But everywhere, too, the progress of wealth, that is, the proportion

of values, is the dominant law; and when economists hold up against the

complaints of the social party the progressive growth of the public wealth,

and the improved conditions of even the most unfortunate classes, they

unwittingly proclaim a truth which is the condemnation of their theories."

What is, exactly, collective wealth, public fortune? It is the wealth of

the bourgeoisie -- not that of each bourgeois in particular. Well, the

economists have done nothing but show how, in the existing relations of

production, the wealth of the bourgeoisie has grown and must grow still

further. As for the working classes, it still remains a very debatable

question whether their condition has improved as a result of the increase

in so-called public wealth. If economists, in support of their optimism,

cite the example of the English workers employed in the cotton industry,

they see the condition of the latter only in the rare moments of trade

prosperity. These moments of prosperity are to the periods of crisis and

stagnation in the "true proportion" of 3 to 10. But perhaps also, in speaking

of improvement, the economists were thinking of the millions of workers

who had to perish in the East Indies so as to procure for the million and

a half workers employed in England in the same industry three years' prosperity

out of ten.



<P>&nbsp;As for the temporary participation in the increase of public wealth,

that is a different matter. The fact of temporary participation is explained

by the theory of the economists. It is the confirmation of this theory

and not its "condemnation", as M. Proudhon. If there were anything to be

condemned, it would surely be the system of M. Proudhon, who would reduce

the worker, as we have shown, to the minimum wage, in spite of the increase

of wealth. It is only by reducing the worker to the minimum wage that he

would be able to apply the true proportion of values, of "value constituted"

by labor time. It is because wages, as a result of competition, oscillate

now above, now below, the price of food necessary for the sustenance of

the worker, that he can participate to a certain extent in the development

of collective wealth, and can also perish from want. This is the whole

theory of the economists who have no illusions on the subject.



<P>&nbsp;After his lengthy digressions of railways, on Prometheus, and

on the new society to be reconstituted on "constituted value", M. Proudhon

collects himself; emotion overpowers him and he cried in fatherly tones:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TD>"I beseech the economists to ask themselves for one moment, in the

silence of their hearts -- far from the prejudices that trouble them and

regardless of the employment they are engaged in or hope to obtain, of

the honors which nurse their vanity -- let them say whether before this

day the principle that all labor must leave a surplus appeared to them

with this chain of premises and consequences that we have revealed."&nbsp;</TD>

<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="n2"></A><B>[2]</B> <I>NOTE by Engels to 1885 German edition:</I>

Ricardo, as is well known, determines the value of a commodity by the quantity

of labor necessary for its production. Owing, however, to the prevailing

form of exchange in every mode of production based on production of commodities,

including therefore the capitalist mode of production, this value is not

expressed directly in quantities of labor but in quantities of some other

commodity. The value of a commodity expressed in a quantity of some other

commodity (whether money or not) is termed by Ricardo its relative value.



<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="n3"></A><B>[3]</B> <I>NOTE by Engels to the 1885 German

edition:</I> The thesis that the "natural", i.e., normal, price of labor

power coincides with the wage minimum, i.e., with the equivalent in value

of the means of subsistence absolutely indispensable for the life and procreation

of the worker, was first put forward by me in <I>Sketches for a Critique

of Political Economy</I> (Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher [Franco-German

Annual], Paris 1844) and in <I>The Condition of the Working Class in England

in 1844</I>. As seen here, Marx at that time excepted the thesis. Lassalle

took it over from both of us. Although, however, in reality wages have

a constant tendency to approach the minimum, the above thesis is nevertheless

incorrect. The fact that labor is regularly and on the average paid below

its value cannot alter its value. In <I>Capital</I>, Marx has put the above

thesis right (Section on Buying and Selling Labor of Power) and also (Chapter

25: The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation) analyzed the circumstances

which permit capitalist production to depress the price of labor power

more and more below its value.

up in London, Sheffield, Leeds and many other towns in England. These bazaars

have all ended in scandalous failures after having absorbed considerable

capital. The taste for them has gone for ever. You are warned, M. Proudhon!



<P>&nbsp;<I>NOTE by Engels to the 1885 German edition:</I> It is known

that Proudhon did not take this warning to heart. In 1849 he himself made

an attempt with a new Exchange Bank in Paris. The bank, however, failed

before it had got going properly: a court case against Proudhon had to

serve to cover its collapse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<UL><FONT SIZE=+2>H</FONT>ere we are, right in Germany! We shall now have

to talk metaphysics while talking political economy. And in this again

we shall but follow M. Proudhon's "contradictions". Just now he forced

us to speak English, to become pretty well English ourselves. Now the scene

is changing. M. Proudhon is transporting us to our dear fatherland and

is forcing us, whether we like it or not, to become German again.



<P>&nbsp;If the Englishman transforms men into hats, the German transforms

hats into ideas. The englishman is Ricardo, rich banker and distinguished

economist; the German is Hegel, simple professor at the University of Berlin.



<P>&nbsp;Louis XV, the last absolute monarch and representative of the

decadence of French royalty, had attached to his person a physician who

was himself France's first economist. This doctor, this economist, represented

the imminent and certain triumph of the French bourgeoisie. Doctor Quesnay

made a science out of political economy; he summarized it in his famous

<I>Tablueau economique</I>. Besides the thousand and one commentaries on

this table which have appeared, we possess one by the doctor himself. It

is the "analysis of the economic table", followed by "seven important observations".



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon is another Dr. Quesnay. He is the Quesnay of the metaphysics

of political economy.



<P>&nbsp;Now metaphysics -- indeed all philosophy -- can be summed up,

according to Hegel, in method. We must, therefore, try to elucidate the

method of M. Proudhon, which is at least as foggy as the Economic Table.

It is for this reason that we are making seven more or less important observations.

If Dr. Proudhon is not pleased with our observations, well, then, he will

have to become an Abbe Baydeau and give the "explanation of the economico-metaphysical

method" himself.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><B>First Observation</B></CENTER>



<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"We are not giving a history according to the order in time, but according

to the sequence of ideas. Economic phases or categories are in their manifestation

sometimes contemporary, sometimes inverted.... Economic theories have nonetheless

their logical sequence and their serial relation in the understanding:

it is this order that we flatter our- selves to have discovered."

M. Proudhon most certainly wanted to frighten the French by flinging quasi-Hegelian

phrases at theM. So we have to deal with two men: firstly with M. Proudhon,

and then with Hegel. How does M. Proudhon distinguish himself from other

economists? And what part does Hegel play in M. Proudhon's political economy?



<P>&nbsp;Economists express the relations of bourgeois production, the

division of labor, credit, money, etc., as fixed, immutable, eternal categories.

M. Proudhon, who has these ready-made categories before him, wants to explain

to us the act of formation, the genesis of these categories, principles,

laws, ideas, thoughts.



<P>&nbsp;Economists explain how production takes place in the above-mentioned

relations themselves are produced, but what they do not explain is how

these relations themselves are produced, that is, the historical movement

which gave them birth. M. Proudhon, taking these relations for principles,

categories, abstract thoughts, has merely to put into order these thoughts,

which are to be found alphabetically arranged at the end of every treatise

on political economy. The economists' material is the active, energetic

life of man; M. Proudhon's material is the dogmas of the economists. But

the moment we cease to pursue the historical movement of production relations,

of which the categories are but the theoretical expression, the moment

we want to see in these categories no more than ideas, spontaneous thoughts,

independent of real relations, we are forced to attribute the origin of

these thoughts to the movement of pure reason. How does pure, eternal,

impersonal reason give rise to these thoughts? How does it proceed in order

to produce them?



<P>&nbsp;If we had M. Proudhon's intrepidity in the matter of Hegelianism

we should say: it is distinguished in itself from itself. What does this

mean? Impersonal reason, having outside itself neither a base on which

it can pose itself, nor an object to which it can oppose itself, nor a

subject with which it can compose itself, is forced to turn head over heels,

in posing itself, opposing itself and composing itself -- position, opposition,

composition. Or, to speak Greek -- we have thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.

For those who do not know the Hegelian formula: affirmation, negation and

negation of the negation. That is what language means. It is certainly

not Hebrew (with due apologies M. Proudhon); but it is the language of

this pure reason, separate from the individual. Instead of the ordinary

individual with his ordinary manner of speaking and thinking we have nothing

but this ordinary manner in itself -- without the individual.



<P>&nbsp;Is it surprising that everything, in the final abstraction --

for we have here an abstraction, and not an analysis -- presents itself

as a logical category? Is it surprising that, if you let drop little by

little all that constitutes the individuality of a house, leaving out first

of all the materials of which it is composed, then the form that distinguishes

it, you end up with nothing but a body; that, if you leave out of account

the limits of this body; you soon have nothing but a space -- that if,

finally, you leave out of the account the dimensions of this space, there

is absolutely nothing left but pure quantity, the logical category? If

we abstract thus from every subject all the alleged accidents, animate

or inanimate, men or things, we are right in saying that in the final abstraction,

the only substance left is the logical category. Thus the metaphysicians

who, in making these abstractions, think they are making analyses, and

who, the more they detach themselves from things, imagine themselves to

be getting all the nearer to the point of penetrating to their core --

these metaphysicians in turn are right in saying that things here below

are embroideries of which the logical categories constitute the canvas.

This is what distinguishes the philosopher from the Christian. The Christian,

in spite of logic, has only one incarnation of the <I>Logos</I>; the philosopher

has never finished with incarnations. If all that exists, all that lives

on land, and under water, can be reduced by abstraction to a logical category

-- if the whole real world can be drowned thus in a world of abstractions,

in the world of logical categories -- who need be astonished at it?



<P>&nbsp;All that exists, all that lives on land and under water, exists

and lives only by some kind of movement. Thus, the movement of history

produces social relations; industrial movement gives us industrial products,

etc.



<P>&nbsp;Just as by dint of abstraction we have transformed everything

into a logical category, so one has only to make an abstraction of every

characteristic distinctive of different movements to attain movement in

its abstract condition -- purely formal movement, the purely logical formula

of movement. If one finds in logical categories the substance of all tings,

one imagines one has found in the logical formula of movement the <I>absolute

method</I>, which not only explains all things, but also implies the movement

of things.



<P>&nbsp;It is of this absolute method that Hegel speaks in these terms:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"Method is the absolute, unique, supreme, infinite force, which no

object can resist; it is the tendency of reason to find itself again, to

recognize itself in every object."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>(<I>Logic</I>, Vol.III) [29]



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

All things being reduced to a logical category, and every movement, every

act of production, to method, it follows naturally that every aggregate

of products and production, of objects and of movement, can be reduced

to a form of applied metaphysics. What Hegel has done for religion, law,

etc., M. Proudhon seeks to do for political economy.



<P>&nbsp;So what is this absolute method? The abstraction of movement.

What is the abstraction of movement? Movement in abstract condition. What

is movement in abstract condition? The purely logical formula of movement

or the movement of pure reason. Wherein does the movement of pure reason

consist? In posing itself, opposing itself, composing itself; in formulating

itself as thesis, antithesis, synthesis; or, yet, in affirming itself,

negating itself, and negating its negation.



<P>&nbsp;How does reason manage to affirm itself, to pose itself in a definite

category? That is the business of reason itself and of its apologists.



<P>&nbsp;But once it has managed to pose itself as a thesis, this thesis,

this thought, opposed to itself, splits up into two contradictory thoughts

-- the positive and the negative, the yes and no. The struggle between

these two antagonistic elements comprised in the antithesis constitutes

the dialectical movement. The yes becoming no, the no becoming yes, the

yes becoming both yes and no, the no becoming both no and yes, the contraries

balance, neutralize, paralyze each other. The fusion of these two contradictory

thoughts constitutes a new thought, which is the synthesis of theM. This

thought splits up once again into two contradictory thoughts, which in

turn fuse into a new synthesis. Of this travail is born a group of thoughts.

This group of thoughts follows the same dialectic movement as the simple

category, and has a contradictory group as antithesis. Of these two groups

of thoughts is born a new group of thoughts, which is the antithesis of

them.



<P>&nbsp;Just as from the dialectic movement of the simple categories is

born the group, so from the dialectic movement of the groups is born the

series, and from the dialectic movement of the series is born the entire

system.



<P>&nbsp;Apply this method to the categories of political economy and you

have the logic and metaphysics of political economy, or, in other words,

you have the economic categories that everybody knows, translated into

a little-known language which makes them look as if they had never blossomed

forth in an intellect of pure reason; so much do these categories seem

to engender one another, to be linked up and intertwined with one another

by the very working of the dialectic movement. The reader must not get

alarmed at these metaphysics with all their scaffolding of categories,

groups, series, and systems. M. Proudhon, in spite of all the trouble he

has taken to scale the heights of the system of contradictions, has never

been able to raise himself above the first wo rungs of simple thesis and

antithesis; and even these he has mounted only twice, and on one of these

two occasions he fell over backwards.



<P>&nbsp;Up to now we have expounded only the dialectics of Hegel. We shall

see later how M. Proudhon has succeeded in reducing it to the meanest proportions.

Thus, for Hegel, all that has happened and is still happening is only just

what is happening in his own mind. Thus the philosophy of history is nothing

but the history of philosophy, of his own philosophy. There is no longer

a "history according to the order in time", there is only "the sequence

of ideas in the understanding". He thinks he is constructing the world

by the movement of thought, whereas he is merely reconstructing systematically

and classifying by the absolute method of thoughts which are in the minds

of all.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><B>Second Observation</B></CENTER>





<P>Economic categories are only the theoretical expressions, the abstractions

of the social relations of production, M. Proudhon, holding this upside

down like a true philosopher, sees in actual relations nothing but the

incarnation of the principles, of these categories, which were slumbering

-- so M. Proudhon the philosopher tells us -- in the bosom of the "impersonal

reason of humanity".



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon the economists understands very well that men make

cloth, linen, or silk materials in definite relations of production. But

what he has not understood is that these definite social relations are

just as much produced by men as linen, flax, etc. Social relations are

closely bound up with productive forces. In acquiring new productive forces

men change their mode of production; and in changing their mode of production,

in changing the way of earning their living, they change all their social

relations. The hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill

society with the industrial capitalist.



<P>&nbsp;The same men who establish their social relations in conformity

with the material productivity, produce also principles, ideas, and categories,

in conformity with their social relations.



<P>&nbsp;Thus the ideas, these categories, are as little eternal as the

relations they express. They are historical and transitory products.



<P>&nbsp;There is a continual movement of growth in productive forces,

of destruction in social relations, of formation in ideas; the only immutable

thing is the abstraction of movement -- <I>mors immortalis</I>.



<P>&nbsp;[Ed: Marx quotes these words from the following passage of Lucretius's

poem <I>On The Nature of Things</I> (Book III, line 869): "mortalem vitam

mars immortalis ademit" ("immoratl death hath taken away moral life").]



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><B>Third Observation</B></CENTER>





<P>The production relations of every society form a whole. M. Proudhon

considers economic relations as so many social phases, engendering one

another, resulting one from the other like the antithesis from the thesis,

and realizing in their logical sequence the impersonal reason of humanity.



<P>&nbsp;The only drawback to this method is that when he comes to examine

a single one of these phases, M. Proudhon cannot explain it without having

recourse to all the other relations of society; which relations, however,

he has not yet made his dialectic movement engender. When, after that,

M. Proudhon, be means of pure reason, proceeds to give birth to these other

phases, he treats them as if they were new-born babes. He forgets that

they are of the same age as the first.



<P>&nbsp;Thus, to arrive at the constitution of value, which for him is

the basis of all economic evolutions, he could not do without division

of labor, competition, etc. Yet in the series, in the understand of M.

Proudhon, in the logical sequence, these relations did not exist.



<P>&nbsp;In constructing the edifice of an ideological system by means

of the categories of political economy, the limbs of the social system

are dislocated. The different limbs of society are converted into so many

separate societies, following one upon the other. How, indeed, could the

single logical formula of movement, of sequence, of time, explain the structure

of society, in which all relations coexist simultaneously and support one

another?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><B>Fourth Observation</B></CENTER>





<P>Let us see now to what modifications M. Proudhon subjects Hegel's dialectics

when he applies it to political economy.



<P>&nbsp;For him, M. Proudhon, every economic category has two sides --

one good, the other bad. He looks upon these categories as the petty bourgeois

looks upon the great men of history: Napoleon was a great man; he did a

lot of good; he also did a lot of harm.



<P>&nbsp;The good side and the bad side, the advantages and drawbacks,

taken together form for M. Proudhon the contradiction in every economic

category.



<P>&nbsp;The problem to be solved: to keep the good side, while eliminating

the bad.



<P>&nbsp;Slavery is an economic category like any other. Thus it also has

its two sides. let us leave alone the bad side and talk about the good

side of slavery. Needlesstosay, we are dealing only with direct slavery,

with Negro slavery in Surinam, in Brazil, in the Southern States of North

America.



<P>&nbsp;Direct slavery is just as much the pivot of bourgeois industry

as machinery, credits, etc. Without slavery you have no cotton; without

cotton you have no modern industry. It is slavery that gave the colonies

their value; it is the colonies that created world trade, and it is world

trade that is the precondition of large-scale industry. Thus slavery is

an economic category of the greatest importance.



<P>&nbsp;Without slavery North America, the most progressive of countries,

would be transformed into a patriarchal country. Wipe North America off

the map of the world, and you will have anarchy -- the complete decay of

modern commerce and civilization. Cause slavery to disappear and you will

have wiped America off the map of nations.



<P>&nbsp;

<UL>[NOTE by Engels to 1885 German edition: This was perfectly correct

for the year 1847 [when Marx wrote these lines]. At that time the world

trade of the United State was limited mainly to import of immigrants and

industrial products, and export of cotton and tobacco, i.e., of the products

of southern slave labor. The Northern States produced mainly corn and meat

for the slave states. It was only when the North produced corn and meat

for export and also became an industrial country, and when the American

cotton monopoly had to face powerful competition, in India, Egypt, Brazil,

etc., that the abolition of slavery became possible. And even then this

led to the ruin of the South, which did not succeed in replacing the open

Negro slavery by the disguised slavery is Indian and Chinese coolies. ]



<P>&nbsp;</UL>

Thus slavery, because it is an economic category, has always existed among

the institutions of the peoples. Modern nations have been able only to

disguise slavery in their own countries, but they have imposed it without

disguise upon the New World.



<P>&nbsp;What would M. Proudhon do to save slavery? He would formulate

the problem thus: preserve the good side of this economic category, eliminate

the bad.



<P>&nbsp;Hegel has no problems to formulate. He has only dialectics. M.

Proudhon has nothing of Hegel's dialectics but the language. for him the

dialectic movement is the dogmatic distinction between good and bad.



<P>&nbsp;Let us for a moment consider M. Proudhon himself as a category.

Let us examine his good and bad side, his advantages and his drawbacks.



<P>&nbsp;If he has the advantage over Hegel of setting problems which he

reserves the right of solving for the greater good of humanity, he has

the drawback of being stricken with sterility when it is a question of

engendering a new category by dialectical birth-throes. What constitutes

dialectical movement is the coexistence of two contradictory sides, their

conflict and their fusion into a new category. The very setting of the

problem of eliminating the bad side cuts short the dialectic movement.

It is not the category which is posed and opposed to itself, by its contradictory

nature, it is M. Proudhon who gets excited, perplexed and frets and fumes

between the two sides of the category.



<P>&nbsp;Caught thus in a blind alley, from which it is difficult to escape

by legal means, M. Proudhon takes a real flying leap which transports him

at one bound into a new category. Then it is that, to his astonished gaze,

is revealed the <I>serial relation in the understanding</I>.



<P>&nbsp;He takes the first category that comes handy and attributes to

it arbitrarily the quality of supplying a remedy for the drawbacks of the

category to be purified. Thus, if we are to believe M. Proudhon, taxes

remedy the drawbacks of monopoly; the balance of trade, the drawbacks of

taxes; landed property, the drawbacks of credit.



<P>&nbsp;By taking the economic categories thus successively, one by one,

and making one the antidote to the other, M. Proudhon manages to make with

this mixture of contradictions and antidotes to contradictions, two volumes

of contradictions, which he rightly entitles: <I>The System of Economic

Contradictions</I>.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><B>Fifth Observation</B></CENTER>



<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"In the absolute reason all these ideas... are equally simple, and

general.... In fact, we attain knowledge only by a sort of scaffolding

of our ideas. But truth in itself is independent of these dialectical symbols

<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

Here all of a sudden, by a kind of switch-over of which we now know the

secret, the metaphysics of political economy has become an illusion! Never

has M. Proudhon spoken more truly. Indeed, from the moment the process

of the dialectic movement is reduced to the simple process of opposing

good to bad, and of administering one category as an antidote to another,

the categories are deprived of all spontaneity; the idea "ceases to function";

there is no life left in it. It is no longer posed or decomposed into categories.

The sequence of categories has become a sort of scaffolding. Dialectics

has ceased to be the movement of absolute reason. There is no longer any

dialectics but only, at the most, absolutely pure morality.



<P>&nbsp;When M. Proudhon spoke of the series in the understanding, of

the logical sequence of categories, he declared positively that he did

not want to give history according to the order in time, that is, in M.

Proudhon's view, the historical sequence in which the categories have manifested

themselves. Thus for him everything happened in the pure ether of reason.

Everything was to be derived from this ether by means of dialectics. Now

that he has to put this dialectics into practice, his reason is in default.

M. Proudhon's dialectics runs counter to Hegel's dialectics, and now we

have M. Proudhon reduced to saying that the order in which he gives the

economic categories is no longer the order in which they engender on e

another. Economic evolutions are no longer the evolutions of reason itself.



<P>&nbsp;What then does M. Proudhon give us? Real history, which is, according

to M. Proudhon's understanding, the sequence in which the categories have

manifested themselves in order of time? No! History as it take place in

the idea itself? Still less! That is, neither the profane history of categories,

nor their sacred history! What history does he give us then? The history

of his own contradictions. Let us see how they go, and how they drag M.

Proudhon in their train.



<P>&nbsp;Before entering upon this examination, which gives rise to the

sixth important observation, we have yet another, less important observation

to make.



<P>&nbsp;Let us admit with M. Proudhon that real history, history according

to the order in time, is the historical sequence in which ideas, categories

and principles have manifested themselves.



<P>&nbsp;Each principle has had its own century in which to manifest itself.

The principle of authority, for example, had the 11th century, just as

the principle of individualism had the 18th century. In logical sequence,

it was the century that belonged to the principle, and not the principle

which belonged to the century. When, consequently, in order to save principles

as much as to save history, we ask ourselves why a particular principle

was manifested in the 11th century or in the 18th century rather than in

any other, we are necessarily forced to examine minutely what men were

like in the 11th century, what they were like in the 18th, what were their

respective needs, their productive forces, their mode of production, the

raw materials of their production -- in short, what were the relations

between man and man which resulted from all these conditions of existence.

To get to the bottom of all these questions -- what is this but to draw

up the real, profane history of men in every century and to present these

men as both the authors and the actors of their own drama? But the moment

you present men as the actors and authors of their own history, you arrive

-- by detour -- at the real starting point, because you have abandoned

those eternal principles of which you spoke at the outset.



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon has not even gone far enough along the crossroad which

an ideologist takes to reach the main road of history.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><B>Sixth Observation</B></CENTER>





<P>Let us take the crossroad with M. Proudhon.



<P>&nbsp;We shall concede that economic relations, viewed as immutable

laws, eternal principles, ideal categories, existed before active and energetic

men did; we shall concede further that these laws, principles and categories

had, since the beginning of time, slumbered "in the impersonal reason of

humanity". We have already seen that, with all these changeless and motionless

eternities, there is no history left; there is at most history in the idea,

that is, history reflected in the dialectic movement of pure reason. M.

Proudhon, by saying that, in the dialectic movement ideas are no longer

differentiated, has done away with both the shadow of movement and the

movement of shadows, by means of which one could still have created at

least a semblance of history. Instead of that, he imputes to history his

own impotence. He lays the blame on everything, even the French language.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"It is not correct then," says M. Proudhon, the philosopher, "to say

that something appears, that something is produced: in civilization as

in the universe, everything has existed, has acted, from eternity. This

applies to the whole of social economy."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>(Vol.II, p.102)



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

So great is the productive force of the contradictions which function and

which made M. Proudhon function, that, in trying to explain history, he

is forced to deny it; in trying to explain the successive appearance of

social relations, he denies that anything can appear: in trying to explain

production, with all its phases, he questions whether anything can be produced!



<P>&nbsp;Thus, for M. Proudhon, there is no longer any history: no longer

any sequence of ideas. And yet his book till exists; and it is precisely

that book which is, to use his own expression, "history according to the

sequence of ideas". How shall we find a formula, for M. Proudhon is a man

of formulas, to help him to clear all these contradictions in one leap?



<P>&nbsp;To this end he has invented a new reason, which is neither the

pure and virgin absolute reason, nor the common reason of men living and

acting in different periods, but a reason quite apart -- the reason of

the person, Society -- of the subject, Humanity -- which under the pen

of M. Proudhon figures at times also as social genius, general reason,

or finally as human reason. This reason, decked out under so many names,

betrays itself nevertheless, at every moment, as the individual reason

of M. Proudhon, with its good and its bad side, its antidotes and its problems.



<P>&nbsp;"Human reason does not create truth", hidden in the depths of

absolute, eternal reason. It can only unveil it. But such truths as it

has unveiled up to now are incomplete, insufficient, and consequently contradictory.

Hence, economic categories, being themselves truths discovered, revealed

by human reason, by social genius, are equally incomplete and contain within

themselves the germ of contradictions. before M. Proudhon, social genius

saw only the antagonistic elements, and not the synthetic formula, both

hidden simultaneously in absolute reason. Economic relations, which merely

realize on earth these insufficient truths, these incomplete ideas, are

consequently contradictory in themselves, and present two sides, one good,

the other bad.



<P>&nbsp;To find complete truth, the idea, in all its fullness, the synthetic

formula that is to annihilate the contradiction, this is the problem of

social genius. This again is why, in M. Proudhon's illusion, this same

social genius has been harried from one category to another without ever

having been able, despite all its battery of categories, to snatch from

God or from absolute reason, a synthetic formula.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"At first, society (social genius) states a primary fact, puts forward

a hypothesis... a veritable antinomy, whose antagonistic results develop

in the social economy in the same way as its consequences could have been

deduced in the mind; so that industrial movement, following in all things

the deduction of ideas, splits up into two currents, one of useful effects,

the other of subversive results. To bring harmony into the constitution

of this two-side principle, and to solve this antinomy, society gives rise

to a second, which will soon be followed by a third; and progress of social

genius will take place in this manner, until, having exhausted all its

contradictions -- I suppose, but it is not proved that there is a limit

to human contradictions -- it returns in one leap to all its former positions

and with a single formula solves all its problems."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>(Vol.I p.133)



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

Just the as antithesis was before turned into an antidote, so now the thesis

becomes a hypothesis. This change of terms, coming from M. Proudhon, has

no longer anything surprising for us! Human reason, which is anything but

pure, having only incomplete vision, encounters at every step new problems

to be solved. Every new thesis which it discovers in absolute reason and

which is the negation of the first thesis, becomes for it a synthesis,

which it accepts rather naively as the solution of the problem in question.

It is thus that this reason frets and fumes in ever renewing contradictions

until, coming to the end of the contradictions, it perceives that all its

theses and syntheses are merely contradictory hypotheses. In its perplexity,

"human reason, social genius, returns in one leap to all its former positions,

and in a single formula, solves all its problems". This unique formula,

by the way, constitutes M. Proudhon's true discovery. It is constituted

value.



<P>&nbsp;Hypotheses are made only in view of a certain aiM. The aim that

social genius, speaking through the mouth of M. Proudhon, set itself in

the first place, was to eliminate the bad in every economic category, in

order to have nothing left but the good. For it, the good, the supreme

well-being, the real practical aim, is equality. And why did the social

genius aim at equality rather than inequality, fraternity, catholicism,

or any other principle? Because "humanity has successively realized so

many separate hypotheses only in view of a superior hypothesis", which

precisely is equality. In other words: because equality is M. Proudhon's

ideal. He imagines that the division of labor, credit, the workshop --

all economic relations -- were invented merely for the benefit of equality,

and yet they always ended up by turning against it. Since history and the

fiction of M. Proudhon contradict each other at every step, the latter

concludes that there is a contradiction. If there is a contradiction, it

exists only between his fixed idea and real movement.



<P>&nbsp;Henceforth, the good side of an economic relation is that which

affirms equality; the bad side, that which negates it and affirms inequality.

Every new category is a hypothesis of the social genius to eliminate the

inequality engendered by the preceding hypothesis. In short, equality is

th e primordial intention, the mystical tendency, the providential aim

that the social genius has constantly before its eyes as it whirls in the

circle of economic contradictions. Thus, <I>Providence</I> is the locomotive

which makes the whole of M. Proudhon's economic baggage move better than

his pure and volatized reason. He has devoted to Providence a whole chapter,

which follows the one on taxes.



<P>&nbsp;Providence, providential aim, this is the great word used today

to explain the movement of history. In fact, this word explains nothing.

It is at most a rhetorical form, one of the various ways of paraphrasing

facts.



<P>&nbsp;It is a fact that in Scotland landed property acquired a new value

by the development of English industry. This industry opened up new outlets

for wool. In order to produce wool on a large scale, arable land had to

be transformed into pasturage. To effect this transformation, the estates

had to be concentrated. To concentrate the estates, small holdings had

first to be abolished, thousands of tenants had to be driven from their

native soil and a few shepherds in charge of millions of sheep to be installed

in their place. Thus, by successive transformations, landed property in

Scotland has resulted in the driving out of men by sheep. Now say that

the providential aim of the institution of landed property in Scotland

was to have men driven out by sheep, and you will have made providential

history.



<P>&nbsp;Of course, the tendency towards equality belongs to our century.

To say now that all former centuries, with entirely different needs, means

of production, etc., worked providentially for the realization of equality

is, firstly, to substitute the means and the men of our century for the

men and the means of earlier centuries and to misunderstand the historical

movement by which the successive generations transformed the results acquired

by the generations that preceded theM. Economists know very well that the

very thing that was for the one a finished product was for the other but

the raw material for new production.



<P>&nbsp;Suppose, as M. Proudhon does, that social genius produced, or

rather improvised, the feudal lords with the providential aim of transforming

the settlers into responsible and equally-placed workers: and you will

have effected a substitution of aims and of persons worthy of the Providence

that instituted landed property in Scotland, in order to give itself the

malicious pleasure of driving out men by sheep.



<P>&nbsp;But since M. Proudhon takes such a tender interest in Providence,

we refer him to the <I>Histoire de l'economie politique</I> of M. de Villeneuve-Bargemont,

who likewise goes in pursuit of a providential aiM. This aim, however,

is not equality, but catholicism.

<CENTER><B>Seventh and Last Observation</B></CENTER>





<P>Economists have a singular method of procedure. There are only two kinds

of institutions for them, artificial and natural. The institutions of feudalism

are artificial institutions, those of the bourgeoisie are natural institutions.

In this, they resemble the theologians, who likewise establish two kinds

of religion. Every religion which is not theirs is an invention of men,

while their own is an emanation from God. When the economists say that

present-day relations -- the relations of bourgeois production -- are natural,

they imply that these are the relations in which wealth is created and

productive forces developed in conformity with the laws of nature. These

relations therefore are themselves natural laws independent of the influence

of time. They are eternal laws which must always govern society. Thus,

there has been history, but there is no longer any. There has been history,

since there were the institutions of feudalism, and in these institutions

of feudalism we find quite different relations of production from those

of bourgeois society, which the economists try to pass off as natural and

as such, eternal.



<P>&nbsp;Feudalism also had its proletariat -- serfdom, which continued

all the germs of the bourgeoisie. Feudal production also had two antagonistic

elements which are likewise designated by the name of the <I>good side</I>

and the <I>bad side</I> of feudalism, irrespective of the fact that it

is always the bad side that in the end triumphs over the good side. It

is the bad side that produces the movement which makes history, by providing

a struggle. If, during the epoch of the domination of feudalism, the economists,

enthusiastic over the knightly virtues, the beautiful harmony between rights

and duties, the patriarchal life of the towns, the prosperous condition

of domestic industry in the countryside, the development of industry organized

into corporations, guilds and fraternities, in short, everything that constitutes

the good side of feudalism, had set themselves the problem of eliminating

everything that cast a shadow on the picture -- serfdom, privileges, anarchy

-- what would have happened? All the elements which called forth the struggle

would have been destroyed, and the development of the bourgeoisie nipped

in the bud. One would have set oneself the absurd problem of eliminating

history.



<P>&nbsp;After the triumph of the bourgeoisie, there was no longer any

question of the good or the bad side of feudalisM. The bourgeoisie took

possession of the productive forces it had developed under feudalism. All

the old economic forms, the corresponding civil relations, the political

state which was the official expression of the old civil society, were

smashed.



<P>&nbsp;Thus, feudal production, to be judged properly, must be considered

as a mode of production founded on antagonisM. It must be shown how wealth

was produced within this antagonism, how the productive forces were developed

at the same time as class antagonisms, how one of the classes, the bad

side, the drawback of society, went on growing until the material conditions

for its emancipation had attained full maturity. Is not this as good as

saying that the mode of production, the relations in which productive forces

are developed, are anything but eternal laws, but that they correspond

to a definite development of men and of their productive forces, and that

a change in men's productive forces necessarily brings about a change in

their relations of production? As the main thing is not to be deprived

of the fruits of civilization, of the acquired productive forces, the traditional

forms in which they were produced must be smashed. From this moment, the

revolutionary class becomes conservative.



<P>&nbsp;The bourgeoisie begins with a proletariat which is itself a relic

of the proletariat [Marx wrote here "working class" in the copy he gave

N. Utina] of feudal times. In the course of its historical development,

the bourgeoisie necessarily develops its antagonistic character, which

at first is more or less disguised, existing only in a latent state. As

the bourgeoisie develops, there develops in its bosom a new proletariat,

a modern proletariat; there develops a struggle between the proletarian

class and the bourgeoisie class, a struggle which, before being felt, perceived,

appreciated, understood, avowed, and proclaimed aloud by both sides, expresses

itself, to start with, merely in partial and momentary conflicts, in subversive

acts. On the other hand, if all the members of the modern bourgeoisie have

the same interests inasmuch as they form a class as against another class,

they have opposite, antagonistic interests inasmuch as they stand face-to-face

with one another. This opposition of interests results from the economic

conditions of their bourgeois life. From day to day it has becomes clearer

that the production relations in which the bourgeoisie moves have not a

simple, uniform character, but a dual character; that in the selfsame relations

in which wealth is produced, poverty is also produced; that in the selfsame

relations in which there is a development of the productive forces, there

is also a force producing repression; that these relations produce <I>bourgeois

wealth</I> -- i.e., the wealth of the bourgeois class -- only by continually

annihilating the wealth of the individual members of this class and by

producing an ever-growing proletariat.



<P>&nbsp;The more the antagonistic character comes to light, the more the

economists, the scientific representatives of bourgeois production, find

themselves in conflict with their own theory; and different schools arise.



<P>&nbsp;We have the FATALIST economists, who in their theory are as indifferent

to what they call the drawbacks of bourgeois production as the bourgeois

themselves are in practice to the sufferings of the proletarians who help

them to acquire wealth. In this fatalist school, there are Classics and

Romantics. The Classics, like Adam Smith and Ricardo, represent a bourgeoisie

which, while still struggling with the relics of feudal society, works

only to purge economic relations of feudal taints, to increase the productive

forces and to give a new upsurge to industry and commerce. The proletariat

that takes part in this struggle and is absorbed in this feverish labor

experiences only passing, accidental sufferings, and itself regards them

as such. Economists like Adam Smith and Ricardo, who are the historians

of this epoch, have no other mission than that of showing how wealth is

acquired in bourgeois production relations, of formulating these relations

into categories, into laws, and of showing how superior these laws, these

categories, are for the production of wealth to the laws and categories

of feudal society. Poverty is in their eyes merely the pang which accompanies

every childbirth, in nature as in industry.



<P>&nbsp;The ROMANTICS belong to our own age, in which the bourgeoisie

is in direct apposition to the proletariat; in which poverty is engendered

in as great abundance as wealth. The economists now pose as blase fatalists,

who, from their elevated position, cast a proudly disdainful glance at

the human machines who manufacture wealth. They copy all the developments

given by their predecessors, and the indifference which in the latter was

merely naivete becomes in them coquetry.



<P>&nbsp;Next comes the HUMANITARIAN school, which sympathizes with the

bad side of present-day production relations. It seeks, by way of easing

its conscience, to palliate even if slightly the real contrasts; it sincerely

deplores the distress of the proletariat, the unbridled competition of

the bourgeois among themselves; it counsels the workers to be sober, to

work hard and to have few children; it advises the bourgeois to put a reasoned

ardor into production. The whole theory of this school rests on interminable

distinctions between theory and practice, between principles and results,

between ideas and application, between form and content, between essence

and reality, between right and fact, between the good side and the bad

side.



<P>&nbsp;The PHILANTHROPIC school is the humanitarian school carried to

perfection. It denies the necessity of antagonism; it wants to turn all

men into bourgeois; it wants to realize theory in so far as it is distinguished

from practice and contains no antagonisM. It goes without saying that,

in theory, it is easy to make an abstraction of the contradictions that

are met with at every moment in actual reality. This theory would therefore

become idealized reality. The philanthropists, then, want to retain the

categories which express bourgeois relations, without the antagonism which

constitutes them and is inseparable from theM. They think they are seriously

fighting bourgeois practice, and they are more bourgeois than the others.



<P>&nbsp;Just as the economists are the scientific representatives of the

bourgeois class, so the Socialists and Communists are the theoreticians

of the proletarian class. So long as the proletariat is not yet sufficiently

developed to constitute itself as a class, and consequently so long as

the struggle itself of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie has not yet

assumed a political character, and the productive forces are not yet sufficiently

developed in the bosom of the bourgeoisie itself to enable us to catch

a glimpse of the material conditions necessary for the emancipation of

the proletariat and for the formation of a new society, these theoreticians

are merely utopians who, to meet the wants of the oppressed classes, improvise

systems and go in search of a regenerating science. But in the measure

that history moves forward, and with it the struggle of the proletariat

assumes clearer outlines, they no longer need to seek science in their

minds; they have only to take note of what is happening before their eyes

and to become its mouthpiece. So long as they look for science and merely

make systems, so long as they are at the beginning of the struggle, they

see in poverty nothing but poverty, without seeing in it the revolutionary,

subversive side, which will overthrow the old society. From this moment,

science, which is a product of the historical movement, has associated

itself consciously with it, has ceased to be doctrinaire and has become

revolutionary.



<P>&nbsp;Let us return to M. Proudhon.



<P>&nbsp;Every economic relation has a good and a bad side; it is the one

point on which M. Proudhon does not give himself the lie. He sees the good

side expounded by the economists; the bad side he sees denounced by the

Socialists. He borrows from the economists the necessity of eternal relations;

he borrows from the Socialists the illusion of seeing in poverty nothing

but poverty. He is in agreement with both in wanting to fall back upon

the authority of science. Science for him reduces itself to the slender

proportions of a scientific formula; he is the man in search of formulas.

Thus it is that M. Proudhon flatters himself on having given a criticism

of both political economy and communism: he is beneath them both. Beneath

the economists, since, as a philosopher who has at his elbow a magic formula,

he thought he could dispense with going into purely economic details; beneath

the socialists, because he has neither courage enough nor insight enough

to rise, be it even speculatively, above the bourgeois horizon.



<P>&nbsp;He wants to be the synthesis -- he is a composite error.



<P>&nbsp;He wants to soar as the man of science above the bourgeois and

proletarians; he is merely the petty bourgeois, continually tossed back

and forth between capital and labor, political economy and communism.

The division of labor is, according to M. Proudhon, an eternal law, a simple,

abstract category. Therefore the abstraction, the idea, the word must suffice

for him to explain the division of labor at different historical epochs.

Castes, corporations, manufacture, large-scale industry, must be explained

by the single word <I>divide</I>. First study carefully the meaning of

"divide", and you will have no need to study the numerous influences which

give the division of labor a defintive character in every epoch.



<P>&nbsp;Certainly, things would be made much too easy if they were reduced

to M. Proudhon's categories. History does not proceed so categorically.

It took three whole centuries in Germany to establish the first big division

of labor, the separation of the towns from the country. In proportion,

as this one relation of town and country was modified, the whole of society

was modified. To take only this one aspect of the division of labor, you

have the old republics, and you have Christian feudalism; you have old

England with its barons and you have modern England with its cotton lords.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, when there were as yet no colonies, when

America did not yet exist for Europe, when Asia existed only through the

intermediary of Constantinople, when the Mediterranean was the centre of

commercial activity, the division of labor had a very different form, a

very different aspect from that of the 17th century, when t he Spanish,

the Portuguese, the Dutch, the English, and the French had colonies established

in all parts of the world. The extent of the market, its physiognomy, give

to the division of labor at different periods a physiognomy, a character,

which it would be difficult to deduce from the single word <I>divide</I>,

from the idea, from the category.

out the advantages and drawbacks of the law of div- ision, but insist much

more on the first than on the second, because that was more serviceable

for their optimism, and none of them has ever wondered what could be the

drawbacks to a law.... How does the same principle, pursued vigor- ously

to its consequences, lead to diametrically opposite results? Not one economist

before or since A. Smith has even perceived that here was a problem to

elucidate. Say goes to the length of recognizing that in the division of

labor the same cause that produces the good engenders the bad."

In principle, a porter differs less from a philosopher than a mastiff from

a greyhound. It is the division of labor which has set a gulf between theM.

All this does not prevent M. Proudhon from saying elsewhere that Adam Smith

has not the slightest idea of the drawbacks produced by the division of

labor. it is this again that makes him say that J. B. Say was the first

to recognize "that in the division of labor the same cause that produces

the good engenders the bad." [I 96]

Let us do him this justice: Lemontey wittily exposed the unpleasant consequences

of the division of labor as it is constituted today, and M. Proudhon found

nothing to add to it. But now that, through the fault of M. Proudhon, we

have been drawn into this question of priority, let us say again, in passing,

that long before M. Lemontey, and 17 years before Adam Smith, who was a

pupil of A. Ferguson, the last-named gave a clear exposition of the subject

in a chapter which deals specifically with the division of labor.

To bring this literary survey to a close, we expressly deny that "all economists

have insisted far more on the advantages than on the drawbacks of the division

of labor". It suffices to mention Sismondi.



<P>&nbsp;Thus, as far as the advantages of the division of labor are concerned,

M. Proudhon had nothing further to do than to paraphrase the general phrases

known to everybody.



<P>&nbsp;Let us now see how he derives from the division of labor, taken

as a general law, as a category, as a thought, the drawbacks which care

attached to it. How is it that this category, this law implies an unequal

distribution of labor to the detriment of M. Proudhon's equalitarian system?

and uniform manner.... It begins by taking possession of a small number

of the privileged.... It is this preference for person on the part of progress

that has for so long kept up the belief in the natural and providential

inequality of conditions, has given rise to castes, and hierarchically

The division of labor created castes. Now, castes are the drawbacks of

the division of labor; thus, it is the division of labor that has engendered

the drawbacks. Quod erot demonstranduM. ["Which was the thing to be proved."]

Will you go further and ask what made the division of labor create castes.

hierarchical constitutions and privileged persons? M. Proudhon will tell

you: Progress. And what made progress? Limitation. Limitation, for M. Proudhon,

is acceptance of persons on the part of progress.



<P>&nbsp;After philosophy comes history. It is no longer either descriptive

history or dialectical history, it is comparative history. M. Proudhon

establishes a parallel between the present-day printing worker and the

printing worker of the Middle Ages; between the man of letters of today

and the man of letters of the Middle Ages, and he weighs down the balance

on the side of those who belong more or less to the division of labor as

the Middle Ages constituted or transmitted it. He opposes the division

of labor of one historical epoch. Was that what M. Proudhon had to prove?

No. He should have shown us the drawbacks of the division of labor in general,

of the division of labor as a category. Besides, why stress this part of

M. Proudhon's work, since a little later we shall see him formally retract

all these alleged developments?



<P>&nbsp;

<TD>"The first effect of fractional labor," continues M. Proudhon, "after

the depravation of the soul, is the pro- longation of the shifts, which

grow in inverse ratio to the sum total of intelligence expended.... But

as the length of the shifts cannot exceed 16 to 18 hours per day, the moment

the compensation cannot be taken out of the time, it will be taken out

of the price, and the wages will diminish.... What is certain, and the

only thing for us to note, is that the universal conscience does not assess

at the same rate the work of a foreman and the labor of a mechanic's assist-

ant. It is therefore necessary to reduce the price of the day's work; so

that the worker, after having been afflicted in his soul by a degrading

function, cannot escape being struck in his body by the meagreness of his

remuneration."

We pass over the logical value of these syllogisms, which Kant would call

paralogisms which lead astray.



<P>&nbsp;This is the substance of it:



<P>&nbsp;The division of labor reduces the worker to a degrading function;

to this degrading function corresponds a depraved soul; to the depravation

of the soul is befitting an ever-increasing wage reduction. And to prove

that this reduction is befitting to a depraved soul, M. Proudhon says,

to relieve his conscience, that the universal conscience wills it thus.

Is M. Proudhon's soul to be reckoned as a part of the universal conscience?



<P>&nbsp;<I>Machinery</I> is, for M. Proudhon, "the logical antithesis

of the division of labor", and with the help of his dialectics, he begins

by transforming machinery into the workshop.



<P>&nbsp;After presupposing the modern workshop, in order to make poverty

the outcome of the division of labor, M. Proudhon presupposes poverty engendered

by the division of labor, in order to come to the workshop and be able

to represent it as the dialectical negation of that poverty. After striking

the worker morally by a degrading function, physically by the meagreness

of the wage; after putting the worker under the dependence of the foreman,

and debasing his work to the labor of a mechanic's assistant, he lays the

blame again on the workshop and the machinery for degrading the worker

"by giving him a master", and he completes his abasement by making him

"sink from the rank of artisan to that of common laborer". Excellent dialectics!

And if he only stopped there! But no, he has to have a new history of the

division of labor, not any longer to derive the contradictions from it,

but to reconstruct the workshop after his own fashion. To attain this end

he finds himself compelled to forget all he has just said about division.



<P>&nbsp;Labor is organized, is divided differently according to the instruments

it disposes over. The hand-mill presupposes a different division of labor

from the steam-mill. Thus, it is slapping history in the face to want to

begin by the division of labor in general, in order to get subsequently

to a specific instrument of production, machinery.



<P>&nbsp;Machinery is no more an economic category than the bullock that

drags the plough. Machinery is merely a productive force. The modern workshop,

which depends on the application of machinery, is a social production relation,

an economic category.



<P>&nbsp;Let us see now how things happen in M. Proudhon's brilliant imagination.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"In society, the incessant appearance of machinery is the antithesis,

the inverse formula of the division of labor: it is the protest of the

industrial genius against fractional and homical labor. What, actually,

is a machine? A way of uniting different portions of labor which had been

separated by the division of labor. Every machine can be defined as a summary

of several operations.... Thus, through the machine there will be a restoration

of the worker.... machinery, which in political economy places itself in

contradiction to the division of labor, represents synthesis, which in

the human mind is opposed to analysis.... Division merely separated the

different parts of labor, letting each one devote himself to the speciality

which most suited him; the workshop groups the workers according to the

relation of each part to the whole.... It introduces the principle of authority

in labor.... But this is not all; the machine or the workshop, after degrading

the worker by giving him a master, completes his abasement by making him

sink from the rank of artisan to that of common laborer.... The period

we are going through ar the moment, that of machinery, is distinguished

by a special characteristic, the wage worker. The wage worker is subsequent

to the division of labor and to exchange."

Just a simple remark to M. Proudhon. The separation of the different parts

of labor, leaving to each one the opportunity of devoting himself to the

speciality best suited to him -- a separation which M. Proudhon dates from

the beginning of the world -- exists only in modern industry under the

rule of competition.



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon goes on to give us a most "interesting genealogy",

to show how the workshop arose from the division of labor and the wage

worker from the workshop.



<P>&nbsp;

<OL>

<LI>

He supposes a man who "noticed that by dividing up production into its

different parts and having each one performed by a separate worker", the

forces of production would be multiplied.</LI>





<P>&nbsp;

<LI>

This man, "grasping the thread of this idea, tells himself that, by forming

a permanent group of workers selected for the special purpose he sets himself,

he will obtain a more sustained production, etc." [I 161]</LI>





<P>&nbsp;

<LI>

This man makes a proposal to other men, to make them grasp his idea and

the thread of his idea.</LI>





<P>&nbsp;

<LI>

This man, at the beginning of industry, deals on terms of equality with

his companions who later becomes his workmen.</LI>





<P>&nbsp;

<LI>

"One realizes, in fact, that this original equality had rapidly to disappear

in view of the advantageous position of the master and the dependence of

the wage-earner." [I 163]</LI>





<P>&nbsp;</OL>

That is another example of M. Proudhon's historical and descriptive method.



<P>&nbsp;Let us now examine, from the historical and economic point of

view, whether the workshop of the machine really introduced the principle

of authority in society subsequently to the division of labor; whether

it rehabilitated the worker on the one hand, while submitting him to authority

on the other; whether the machine is the recomposition of divided labor,

the synthesis of labor as opposed to its analysis.



<P>&nbsp;Society as a whole has this in common with the interior of a workshop,

that it too has its division of labor. If one took as a model the division

of labor in a modern workshop, in order to apply it to a whole society,

the society best organized for the production of wealth would undoubtedly

be that which had a single chief employer, distributing tasks to different

members of the community according to a previously fixed rule. But this

is by no means the case. While inside the modern workshop the division

of labor is meticulously regulated by the authority of the employer, modern

society has no other rule, no other authority for the distribution of labor

than free competition.



<P>&nbsp;Under the patriarchal system, under the caste system, under the

feudal and corporative system, there was division of labor in the whole

of society according to fixed rules. Were these rules established by a

legislator? No. Originally born of the conditions of material production,

they were raised to the status of laws only much later. In this way, these

different forms of the division of labor became so many bases of social

organization. As for the division in the workshop, it was very little developed

in all these forms of society.



<P>&nbsp;It can even be laid down as a general rule that the less authority

presides over the division of labor inside society, the more the division

of labor develops inside the workshop, and the more it is subjected there

to the authority of a single person. Thus authority in the workshop and

authority in society, in relation to the division of labor, are in <I>inverse

ratio</I> to each other.



<P>&nbsp;The question now is what kind of workshop it is in which the occupations

are very much separated, where each worker's task is reduced to a very

simple operation, and where the authority, capital, groups and directs

the work. How was this workshop brought into existence? In order to answer

this question, we shall have to examine how manufacturing industry, properly

so-called, has developed. I am speaking here of that industry which is

not yet industry, with its machinery, but which is already no longer the

industry of the artisans of the Middle Ages, nor domestic industry. We

shall not go into great detail: we shall merely give a few main points

to show that history is not to be made with formulas.



<P>&nbsp;One of the most indispensable conditions for the formation of

manufacturing industry was the accumulation of capital, facilitated by

the discovery of America and the import of its precious metals.



<P>&nbsp;It is sufficiently proved that the increase in the means of exchange

resulted in the depreciation of wages and land rents, on the one hand,

and the growth of industrial profits on the other. In other words: to the

extent that the propertied class and the working class, the feudal lords

and the people, sank, to that extent the capitalist class, the bourgeoisie,

rose.



<P>&nbsp;There were yet other circumstances which contributed simultaneously

to the development of manufacturing industry: the increase of commodities

put into circulation from the moment that trade had penetrated to the East

Indies by way of the Cape of Good Hope; the colonial system; the development

of maritime trade.



<P>&nbsp;Another point which has not yet been sufficiently appreciated

in the history of manufacturing industry is the disbanding of the numerous

retinues of feudal lords, whose subordinate ranks became vagrants before

entering the workshop. The creation of the workshop was preceded by an

almost universal vagrancy in the 15th and 16th centuries. The workshop

found, besides, a powerful support in the many peasants who, continually

driven from the country owing to the transformation of the fields into

pastures and to the progress in agriculture which necessitated fewer hands

for the tillage of the soil, went on congregating in the towns during whole

centuries.



<P>&nbsp;The growth of the market, the accumulation of capital, the modification

in the social position of the classes, a large number of persons being

deprived of their sources of income, all these are historical preconditions

for the formation of manufacture. It was not, as M. Proudhon says, friendly

agreements between equals that brought men into the workshop. It was not

even in the bosom of the old guilds that manufacture was born. It was the

merchant that became head of the modern workshop, and not the old guildmaster.

Almost every where there was a desperate struggle between manufacture and

crafts.



<P>&nbsp;The accumulation and concentration of instruments and workers

preceded the development of the division of labor inside the workshop.

Manufacture consisted much more in the bringing together of many workers

and many crafts in one place, in one room under the command of one capital,

than in the analysis of labor and the adaptation of a special worker to

a very simple task.



<P>&nbsp;The utility of a workshop consisted much less in the division

of labor as such than in the circumstances that work was done on a much

larger scale, that many unnecessary expenses were saved, etc. At the end

of the 16th and at the beginning of the 17th century, Dutch manufacture

scarcely knew any division of labor.



<P>&nbsp;The development of the division of labor supposes the assemblage

of workers in a workshop. There is not one single example, whether in the

16th or in the 17th century, of the different branches of one and the same

craft being exploited separately to such an extent that it would have sufficed

to assemble them all in one place so as to obtain a complete, ready-made

workshop. But once the men and the instruments had been brought together,

the division of labor, such as it had existed in the form of the guilds,

was reproduced, necessarily reflected inside the workshop.



<P>&nbsp;For M. Proudhon, who sees things upside down, if he sees them

at all, the division of labor, in Adam Smith's sense, precedes the workshop,

which is a condition of its existence.



<P>&nbsp;Machinery, properly so-called, dates from the end of the 18th

century. Nothing is more absurd than to see in machinery the <I>antithesis</I>

of the division of labor, the <I>synthesis</I> restoring unity to divided

labor.



<P>&nbsp;The machine is a unification of the instruments of labor, and

by no means a combination of different operations for the worker himself.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TD>"When, by the division of labor, each particular operation has been

Simple tools; accumulation tools; composite tools; setting in motion of

a composite tool by a single hand engine, by man; setting in motion of

these instruments by natural forces, machines; system of machines having

one motor; system of machines having one automatic motor -- this is the

progress of machinery.



<P>&nbsp;The concentration of the instruments of production and the division

of labor are as inseparable one from the other as are, in the political

sphere, the concentration of public authority and the division of private

interests. England, with the concentration of the land, this instrument

of agricultural labor, has at the same time division of agricultural labor

and the application of machinery to the exploitation of the soil. France,

which has the division of the instruments, the small holdings system, has,

in general, neither division of agricultural labor nor application of machinery

to the soil.



<P>&nbsp;For M. Proudhon the concentration of the instruments of labor

is the negation of the division of labor. In reality, we find again the

reverse. As the concentration of instruments develops, the division develops

also, and vice versa. This is why every big mechanical invention is followed

by a greater division of labor, and each increase in the division of labor

gives rise in turn to new mechanical inventions.



<P>&nbsp;We need not recall the fact that the great progress of the division

of labor began in England after the invention of machinery. Thus, the weavers

and spinners were for the most part peasants like those one still meets

in backward countries. The invention of machinery brought about the separation

of manufacturing industry from agricultural industry. The weaver and the

spinner, united but lately in a single family, were separated by the machine.

Thanks to the machine, the spinner can live in England while the weaver

resides in the East Indies. Before the invention of machinery, the industry

of a country was carried on chiefly with raw materials that were the products

of its own soil; in England -- wool, in Germany -- flax, in France -- silks

and flax, in the East Indies and the Levant -- cottons, etc. Thanks to

the application of machinery and of steam, the division of labor was about

to assume such dimensions that large-scale industry, detached from the

national soil, depends entirely on the world market, on international exchange,

on an international division of labor. In short -- the machine has so great

an influence on the division of labor, that when, in the manufacture of

some object, a means has been found to produce parts of it mechanically,

the manufacture splits up immediately into two works independent of each

other.



<P>&nbsp;Need we speak of the philanthropic and providential aim that M.

Proudhon discovers in the invention and first application of machinery?



<P>&nbsp;When in England the market had become so far developed that manual

labor was no longer adequate, the need for machinery was felt. Then came

the idea of the application of mechanical science, already quite developed

in the 18th century.



<P>&nbsp;The automatic workshop opened its career with acts which were

anything but philanthropic. Children were kept at work at the whip's end;

they were made an object of traffic and contracts were undertaken with

the orphanages. All the laws on the apprenticeship of workers were repealed,

because, to use M. Proudhon's phraseology, there was no further need for

<I>synthetic</I> workers. Finally, from 1825 onwards, almost all the new

inventions were the result of collisions between the worker and the employer

who sought at all costs to depreciate the worker's specialized ability.

After each new strike of any importance, there appeared a new machine.

So little indeed did the worker see in the application of machinery a sort

of rehabilitation, <I>restoration</I> -- as M. Proudhon would say -- that

in the 18th century he stood out for a very long time against the incipient

domination of the automation.

<TD>"Wyatt," says Doctor Ure, "invented the series of fluted rollers...

(the spinning fingers usually ascribed to Awkright)....



<P>&nbsp;"The main difficulty did not, to my apprehension, lie so much

in the invention of a proper self-acting mechanism... as in training human

beings to renounce their desultory habits of work, and to identify themselves

with the unvarying regular- ity of the complex automation. But to devise

and administer a successful code of factory discipline, suited to the necessities

of factory diligence, was the Herculean enter- prise, the noble achievement

of Awkright."

In short, by the introduction of machinery, the division of labor inside

society has grown up, the task of the worker inside the workshop has been

simplified, capital has been concentrated, human beings have been further

dismembered.



<P>&nbsp;When M. Proudhon wants to be an economist, and to abandon for

a moment the "evolution of ideas in serial relation in the understanding",

then he goes and draws erudition from Adam Smith, from a time when the

automatic workshop was only just coming into existence. Indeed, what a

difference between the division of labor as it existed in Adam Smith's

day and as we see it in the automatic workshop! In order to make this properly

understood, we nee d only quote a few passages from Dr. Ure's <I>The Philosophy

of Manufactures</I>.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"When Adam Smith wrote his immortal elements of economics, automatic

machinery being hardly known, he was properly led to regard the division

of labor as the grand principle of manufacturing improvement; and he showed,

in the example of pin-making, how each handicraftsman, being thereby enabled

to perfect himself by practice in one point, became a quicker and cheaper

workman. In each branch of manufacture he saw that some parts were, on

that principle, of easy execution, like the cutting of pin wires into uniform

lengths, and some were comparatively difficult, like the formation and

fixation of their heads; and therefore he concluded that to each a workman

of appropriate value and cost was naturally assigned. This appropriation

forms the very essence of the division of labor....



<P>&nbsp;"But what was in Dr. Smith's time a topic of useful illus- tration,

cannot now be used without risk of misleading the public mind as to the

right principle of manufacturing industry. In fact, the division, or rather

adaptation of labor to the different talents of men, is little thought

of in factory employment. On the contrary, wherever a process requires

a peculiar dexterity and steadiness of hand, it is withdrawn as soon as

possible from the cunning workman, who is prone to irregularities of many

kinds, and it is placed in charge of a peculiar mechanism, so self-regulating,

that a child may superintend it.



<P>&nbsp;"The principle of the factory system then is, to substitute mechanical

science for hand skill, and the partition of a process into its essential

constituents, for the division or gradation of labor among artisans. On

the handicraft plan, labor more or less skilled, was usually the most expensive

element of production... but on the automatic plan, skilled labor gets

progressively superseded, and will, eventually, be replaced by mere overlookers

of machines.



<P>&nbsp;"By the infirmity of human nature it happens, that the more skillful

the workman, the more self-willed and intractable he is apt to become,

and, of course, the less fit a compon- ent of a mechanical system, in which,

by occassional irreg- ularities, he may do great damage to the whole. The

grand object therefore of the modern manufacturer is, through the union

of capital and science, to reduce the task of his workpeople to the exercise

of vigilance and dexterity -- faculties, when concentrated to one process,

speedily brought to perfection in the young.



<P>&nbsp;"On the gradation system, a man must serve an apprenticeship of

many years before his hand and eye become skilled enough for certain mechanical

feats; but on the system of decompos- ing a process into its constituents,

and embodying each part in an automatic machine, a person of common care

and capa- city may be entrusted with any of the said elementary parts after

a short probation, and may be transferred from one to another, on any emergency,

at the discretion of the master. Such translations are utterly at variance

with the old prac- tice of the division of labor, which fixed one man to

shaping the head of a pin, another to shaping the head of a pin, and another

to sharpening its point, with the most irksome and spirit-wasting uniformity,

for a whole life....



<P>&nbsp;"But on the equalization plan of self-acting machines, the operative

needs to call his faculties only into agreeable exercise.... As his business

consists in ending the work of a well-regulated mechanism, he can learn

it in a short period; and when he transfers his services, from one machine

to another, he varies his task, and enlarges his views, by thinking on

those general combinations which result from his and his companions' labors.

Thus, that cramping of the fac- ulties, that narrowing of the mind, that

stunting of the frame, which were ascribed, and not unjustly, by moral

writers, to the division of labor, cannot, in common circum- stances, occur

under the equable distribution of industry....



<P>&nbsp;"It is, in fact, the constant aim and tendency of every improvement

in machinery to supersede human labor altogether, or to diminish its cost,

by substituting the industry of women and children for that of men; of

that of ordinary laborers for trained artisans.... This tendency to employ

merely children with watchful eyes and nimble fingers, instead of journeymen

of long experience, shows how the scholastic dogma of the division of labor

into degrees of skill has been exploded by our enlightened manufacturers."

What characterizes the division of labor inside modern society is that

it engenders specialized functions, specialists, and with them craft-idiocy.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"We are struck with admiration," says Lemontey, "when we see among

the Ancients the same person distinguishing himself to a high degree as

philosopher, poet, orator, historian, priest, administrator, general of

an army. Our souls are appalled at the sight of so vast a domain. Each

one of us plants his hedge and shuts himself up in his enclosure. I do

not know whether by this parcellation the field is enlarged, but I do know

that man is belittled."



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

What characterizes the division of labor in the automatic workshop is that

labor has there completely lost its specialized character. But the moment

every special development stops, the need for universality, the tendency

towards an integral development of the individual begins to be felt. The

automatic workshop wipes out specialists and craft-idiocy.



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon, not having understood even this one revolutionary

side of the automatic workshop, takes a step backward and proposes to the

worker that he make not only the 12th part of a pin, but successively all

12 parts of it. The worker would thus arrive at the knowledge and the consciousness

of the pin. This is M. Proudhon's synthetic labor. Nobody will contest

that to make a movement forward and another movement backward is to make

a synthetic movement.



<P>&nbsp;To sum up, M. Proudhon has not gone further than the petty-bourgeois

ideal. And to realize this ideal, he can think of nothing better than to

take us back to the journeyman or, at most, to the master craftsman of

the Middle Ages. It is enough, he says somewhere in his book, to have created

a masterpiece once in one's life, to have felt oneself just once to be

a man. Is not this, in form as in content, the masterpiece demanded by

the trade guild of the Middle Ages?

<FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>. Proudhon begins by defending the eternal necessity

of competition against those who wish to replace it by <I>emulation</I>

[Engels: The Fourierists].

<TD>There is no "purposeless emulation", and as "the object of every passion

is necessarily analogous to the passion itself -- a woman for the lover,

power for the ambitious, gold for the miser, a garland for the poet --

the object of indus- trial emulation is necessarily profit. Emulation is

nothing but competition itself."

Competition is emulation with a view to profit. Is industrial emulation

necessarily emulation with a view to profit, that is, competition?? M.

Proudhon proves it by affirming it. We have seen that, for him, to affirm

is to prove, just as to suppose is to deny.



<P>&nbsp;If the immediate <I>object</I> of the lover is the woman, the

immediate object of industrial emulation is the product and not the profit.



<P>&nbsp;Competition is not industrial emulation, it is commercial emulation.

In our time industrial emulation exists only in view of commerce. There

are even phases in the economic life of modern nations when everybody is

seized with a sort of craze for making profit without producing. This speculation

craze, which recurs periodically, lays bare the true character of competition,

which seeks to escape the need for industrial emulation.



<P>&nbsp;If you had told an artisan of the 14th century that the privileges

and the whole feudal organization of industry were going to be abrogated

in favor of industrial emulation, called competition, he would have replied

that the privileges of the various corporations, guilds and fraternities

were organized competition. M. Proudhon does not impose upon this when

he affirms that "emulation is nothing but competition itself".

Instead of a supposition, an affirmation and a negation, we have now a

decree that M. Proudhon issues purposely to prove the necessity of competition,

its eternity as a category, etc.



<P>&nbsp;If we imagine that decrees are all that is needed to get away

from competition, we shall never get away from it. And if we go so far

as to propose to abolish competition while retaining wages, we shall be

proposing nonsense by royal decree. But nations do not proceed by royal

decree. Before framing such ordinances, they must at least have changed

from top to bottom the conditions of their industrial and political existence,

and consequently their whole manner of being.



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon will reply, with his imperturbable assurance, that

it is the hypothesis of "a transformation of our nature without historical

antecedents", and that he would be right in "excluding is from the discussion",

we know not in virtue of which ordinance.



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon does not know that all history is nothing but a continuous

transformation of human nature.

<TD>"Let us stick to the facts. The French Revolution was made for industrial

liberty as much as for political liberty; and although France, in 1789,

had not perceived -- let us say it openly -- all the consequences of the

principle whose real- ization it demanded, it was mistaken neither in its

wishes nor in its expectations. Whoever attempts to deny this loses, in

my view, the right to criticisM. I will never dispute with an adversary

who puts as principle the spont- aneous error of 25 million men....



<P>&nbsp;"Why then, if competition had not been a principle of social economy,

a decree of fate, a necessity of the human soul, why, instead of abolishing

corporations, guilds and brother- hoods, did nobody think rather of repairing

the whole??"

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>[I 191, 192]



<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TABLE></CENTER>

So, since the French of the 18th century abolished corporations, guilds,

and fraternities instead of modifying them, the French of the 19th century

must modify competition instead of abolishing it. Since competition was

established in France in the 18th century as a result of historical needs,

this competition must not be destroyed in the 19th century because of other

historical needs. M. Proudhon, not understanding that the establishment

of competition was bound up with the actual development of the men of the

18th century, makes of competition a necessity of the <I>human soul</I>,

in partibus infidelium [ed: literally, "territory of the infidels"; here,

meaning, "beyond the realm of reality".] What would he have made of the

great Colbert for the 17th century??



<P>&nbsp;After the revolution comes the present state of affairs. M. Proudhon

equally draws facts from it to show the eternity of competition, by proving

that all industries in which this category is not yet sufficiently developed,

as in agriculture, are in a state of inferiority and decrepitude.



<P>&nbsp;To say that there are industries which have not yet reached the

stage of competition, that others gains are below the level of bourgeois

production, is drivel which gives not the slightest proof of the eternity

of competition.



<P>&nbsp;All M. Proudhon's logic amounts to is this: competition is a social

relation in which we are now developing our productive forces. To this

truth, he gives no logical development, but only forms, often very well

developed, when he says that competition is industrial emulation, the present-day

mode of freedom, responsibility in labor, constitution of value, a condition

for the advent of equality, a principle of social economy, a decree of

fate, a necessity of the human soul, an inspiration of eternal justice,

liberty in division, division on liberty, an economic category.

Whoever says competition says common aim, and that proves, on the one hand,

that competition is association; on the other, that competition is not

egoisM. And whoever says <I>egoism</I>, does he not say common aim?? Every

egoism operates in society and by the fact of society. Hence it presupposes

society, that is to say, common aims, common needs, common means of production,

etc., etc. Is it, then, be mere chance that the competition and association

which the Socialists talk about are not even divergent??



<P>&nbsp;Socialists know well enough that present-day society is founded

on competition. How could they accuse competition of overthrowing present-day

society which they want to overthrow themselves?? And how could they accuse

competition of overthrowing the society to come, in which they see, on

the contrary, the overthrow of competition??



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon says, later on, that competition is the <I>opposite

of monopoly</I>, and consequently cannot be the <I>opposite of association</I>.



<P>&nbsp;Feudalism was, from its origins, opposed to patriarchal monarchy;

it was thus not opposed to competition, which was not yet in existence.

Does it follow that competition is not opposed to feudalism??



<P>&nbsp;In actual fact, <I>society</I>, <I>association</I> are denominations

which can be given to every society, to feudal society as well as to bourgeois

society which is association founded on competition. How then can there

be Socialists, who, by the single word <I>association</I>, think they can

refute competition?? And how can M. Proudhon himself wish to defend competition

against socialism by describing competition by the single word <I>association</I>??



<P>&nbsp;All we have just said makes up the beautiful side of competition

as M. Proudhon sees it. Now let us pass on to the ugly side, that is the

negative side, of competition, its drawbacks, its destructive, subversive

elements, its injurious qualities.



<P>&nbsp;There is something dismal about the picture M. Proudhon draws

of it.



<P>&nbsp;Competition engenders misery, it foments civil war, it "changes

natural zones", mixes up nationalities, causes trouble in families, corrupts

the public conscience, "subverts the notion of equity, of justice", of

morality, and what is worse, it destroys free, honest trade, and does not

even give in exchange <I>synthetic value</I>, fixed, honest price. It disillusions

everyone, even economists. It pushes things so far as to destroy its very

self.



<P>&nbsp;After all the ill M. Proudhon says of it, can there be for the

relations of bourgeois society, for its principles and its illusions, a

more disintegrating, more destructive element than competition??



<P>&nbsp;It must be carefully noted that competition always becomes the

more destructive for bourgeois <I>relations</I> in proportion as it urges

on a feverish creation of new productive forces, that is, of the material

conditions of a new society. In this respect at least, the bad side of

competition would have its good points.

</TABLE></CENTER>

We rejoice with M. Proudhon that he can for once at least properly apply

his formula to thesis and antithesis. Everyone knows that modern monopoly

is engendered by competition itself.



<P>&nbsp;As for the content, M. Proudhon clings to poetic images. Competition

made "of every subdivision of labor a sort of sovereignty in which each

individual stood with his power and his independence". Monopoly is "the

seat of every competing individuality". The sovereignty is worth at least

as much as the seat.



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon talks of nothing but modern monopoly engendered by

competition. But we all know that competition was engendered by feudal

monopoly. Thus competition was originally the opposite of monopoly and

not monopoly the opposite of competition. So that modern monopoly is not

a simple antithesis, it is on the contrary the true synthesis.



<P>&nbsp;THESIS: Feudal monopoly, before competition.



<P>&nbsp;ANTITHESIS: Competition.



<P>&nbsp;SYNTHESIS: Modern monopoly, which is the negation of feudal monopoly,

in so far as it implies the system of competition, and the negation of

competition in so far as it is monopoly.



<P>&nbsp;Thus modern monopoly, bourgeois monopoly, is synthetic monopoly,

the negation of the negation, the unity of opposites. It is monopoly in

the pure, normal, rational state.



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon is in contradiction with his own philosophy when he

turns bourgeois monopoly into monopoly in the crude, primitive, contradictory,

spasmodic state. M. Rossi, whom M. Proudhon quotes several times on the

subject of monopoly, seems to have a better grasp of the synthetic character

of bourgeois monopoly. In his <I>Cours d'economie politique</I>, he distinguishes

between artificial monopolies and natural monopolies. Feudal monopolies,

he says, are artificial, that is, arbitrary; bourgeois monopolies are natural,

that is, rational.



<P>&nbsp;Monopoly is a good thing, reasons M. Proudhon, since it is an

economic category, an emanation "from the impersonal reason of humanity".

Competition, again, is a good thing since it also is an economic category.

But what is not good is the reality of monopoly and the reality of competition.

What is still worse is that competition and monopoly devour each other.

What is to be done?? Look for the synthesis of these two eternal thoughts,

wrest it from the bosom of God, where is has been deposited from time immemorial.



<P>&nbsp;In practical life we find not only competition, monopoly and the

antagonism between them, but also the synthesis of the two, which is not

a formula, but a movement. Monopoly produces competition, competition produces

monopoly. Monopolists are made from competition; competitors become monopolists.

If the monopolists restrict their mutual competition by means of partial

associations, competition increases among the workers; and the more the

mass of the proletarians grows as against the monopolists of one nation,

the more desperate competition becomes between the monopolists of different

nations. The synthesis is of such a character that monopoly can only maintain

itself by continually entering into the struggle of competition.



<P>&nbsp;To make the dialectical transition to the <I>taxes</I> which come

after <I>monopoly</I>, M. Proudhon talks to us about the <I>social</I>

genius which, after zigzagging intrepidly onward,,



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"after striding with a jaunty step, without repenting and without b

lting, reaches the corner of monopoly, casts backward a melancholy glance,

and, after profound reflection, assails all the objects of production with

taxes, and creates a whole administrative organization, in order that all

employments be given to the proletariat and paid by the men of monopoly."

What can we say of this genius, which, while fasting, walks about in a

zigzag?? And what can we say of this walking which has no other object

in view than that of destroying the bourgeois by taxes, whereas taxes are

the very means of giving the bourgeois the wherewithal to preserve themselves

as the ruling class??



<P>&nbsp;Merely to give a glimpse of the manner in which M. Proudhon treats

economic details, it suffices to say that, according to him, the tax on

consumption was established with a view to equality, and to relieve the

proletariat.



<P>&nbsp;The tax on consumption has assumed its true development only since

the rise of the bourgeoisie. In the hands of industrial capital, that is,

of sober and economical wealth, which maintains, reproduces, and increases

itself by the direct exploitation of labor, the tax on consumption was

a means of exploiting the frivolous, gay, prodigal wealth of the fine lords

who did nothing but consume, James Steuart clearly developed this original

purpose of the tax on consumption in his <I>Recherches des principes de

l'economie politique</I>, which he published 10 years before Adam Smith.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TD>"Under the pure monarchy, the prince seems jealous, as it were, of

growing wealth, and therefore imposes taxes upon people who are growing

supposed to make by his profession. The poll-tax and <I>taille</I> are

likewise proportioned to the supposed opulence of everyone libel to them....

In limited governments, impositions are more generally laid upon consumption."

As for the <I>logical sequence</I> of taxes, of the balance of trade, of

credit -- in the understanding of M. Proudhon -- we could only remark that

the English bourgeoisie, on attaining its political constitution under

William of Orange, created all at once a new system of taxes, public credit,

and the system of protective duties, as soon as it was in a position freely

to develop its conditions of existence.



<P>&nbsp;This brief summary will suffice to give the reader a true idea

of M. Proudhon's lubrications on the police or on taxes, the balance of

trade, credit, communism, and population. We defy the most indulgent criticism

to treat these chapters seriously.

<UL><FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>n each historical epoch, property has developed

differently and under a set of entirely different social relations. thus

to define bourgeois property is nothing else than to give an exposition

of all the social relations of bourgeois production.



<P>&nbsp;To try to give a definition of property as of an independent relation,

a category apart, an abstract and eternal idea, can be nothing but an illusion

of metaphysics or jurisprudence.



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon, while seeming to speak of property in general, deals

only with <I>landed property</I>, with <I>ground rent</I>.

So M. Proudhon declares himself incapable of understanding the economic

origin of rent and of property. He admits that this incapacity obliges

him to resort to psychological and moral considerations, which, indeed,

while only distantly connected with the production of wealth, have yet

a very close connection with the narrowness of his historical views. M.

Proudhon affirms that there is something <I>mystical</I> and <I>mysterious</I>

about the origin of property. Now, to see mystery in the origin of property

-- that is, to make a mystery of the relation between production itself

and the distribution of the instruments of production -- is not this, to

use M. Proudhon's language, a renunciation of all claims to economic science??

this new contract."

L'homme aux quarante ecus [ed: "the Man of Forty Ecus" -- the hero of Voltaire's

story of the same name, a modest, hard-working peasant with an annual income

of 40 ecus; the following passage is quoted from the story] foresaw a M.

Proudhon of the future:

In your world, where credit was a means of losing oneself in empty space,

it is very possible that property became necessary in order to bind man

to nature. In the world of real production,where landed property always

precedes credit, M. Proudhon's <I>horror vacui</I> could not exist.



<P>&nbsp;The existence of rent once admitted, whatever its origin, it becomes

a subject of mutually antagonistic negotiations between the farmer and

the landed proprietor. What is the ultimate result of these negotiations,

in other words, what is the average amount of rent?? This is what M. Proudhon

says:



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"Ricardo's theory answers this question. In the beginning of society,

when man, new to earth, had before him nothing but huge forests, when the

earth was vast and when industry was beginning to come to life, rent must

have been nil. Land, as yet unformed by labor, was an object of utility;

it was not an exchange value, it was common, not social. Little by little,

the multiplication of families and the progress of agriculture caused the

price of land to make itself felt. Labor came to give the soil its worth;

from this, rent came into being. The more fruit a field yielded with the

same amount of labor, the higher it was valued; hence the tendency of proprietors

was always to arrogate to themselves the whole amount of the fruits of

the soil, less the wages of the farm -- that is, less the costs of produc-

tion. Thus property followed on the heels of labor to take from it all

the product that exceeded the actual expenses. As the proprietor fulfils

a mystic duty and represents the community as against the <I>colonus</I>,

that farmer is, by the dispensation of Providence, no more than a responsible

laborer, who must account to society for all he reaps above his legitimate

wage....



<P>&nbsp;"In essence and by destination, then, rent is an instrument of

distributive justice, one of the thousand means that the genius of economy

employs to attain to equality. It is an immediate land valuation which

is carried out contradictor- ily by landowners and farmers, without any

possible collu- sion, in a higher interest, and whose ultimate result must

be to equalize the possession of the land between the ex- ploiters of the

soil and the industrialists....



<P>&nbsp;"It needed no less than this magic of property to snatch from

the <I>colonus</I> the surplus of his product which he cannot help regarding

as his own and of which he considers himself to be exclusively the author.

Rent, or rather property, has broken down agricultural egoism and created

a solidarity that no power, no partition of the land could have brought

into being....



<P>&nbsp;"The moral effect of property having been secured, at present

what remains to be done is to distribute the rent."

All this tumult of words may be reduced firstly to this: Ricardo says that

the excess of the price of agricultural products over their cost of production,

including the ordinary profit and interest on the capital, gives the measure

of the rent. M. Proudhon does better. He makes the landowner intervene,

like a <I>Deus ex machina</I>, and snatch from the <I>colonus</I> all the

surplus of his production over the cost of production. He makes use of

the intervention of the landowner [proprietaire] to explain property [propriete],

of the intervention of the rent-receiver [rentier] to explain rent [rente].

He answers the problem by formulating the same problem and adding an extra

syllable. [Marx makes a play on words: turning "propriete" into "proprietaire"

and "rente" into "rentier".]



<P>&nbsp;Let us note also that in determining rent by the difference in

fertility of the soil, M. Proudhon assigns a new origin to it, since land,

before being assessed according to different degrees of fertility, "was

not", in his view, "an exchange value, but was common". What, then, has

happened to the fiction about rent having come into being through the necessity

of bringing back to the land man who was about to lose himself in the infinity

of empty space??



<P>&nbsp;Now let us free Ricardo's doctrine from the providential, allegorical,

and mystical phrases in which M. Proudhon has been careful to wrap it.



<P>&nbsp;Rent, in the Ricardian sense, is property in land in its bourgeois

state; that is, feudal property which has become subject to the conditions

of bourgeois production.



<P>&nbsp;We have seen that, according to the Ricardian doctrine, the price

of all objects is determined ultimately by the cost of production, including

the industrial profit; in other words, by the labor time employed. In manufacturing

industry, the price of the product obtained by the minimum of labor regulates

the price of all other commodities of the same kind, seeing that the cheapest

and most productive instruments of production can be multiplied to infinity

and that competition necessarily gives rise to a market price -- that is,

a common price for all products of the same kind.



<P>&nbsp;In agricultural industry, on the contrary, it is the price of

the product obtained by the greatest amount of labor which regulates the

price of all products of the same kind. In the first place, one cannot,

as in manufacturing industry, multiply at will the instruments of production

possessing the same degree of productivity, that is, plots of land with

the same degree of fertility. Then, as population increases, land of an

inferior quality begins to be exploited, or new outlays of capital, proportionately

less productive than before, are made upon the same plot of land. In both

cases a greater amount of labor is expended to obtain a proportionately

smaller product. The needs of the population having rendered necessary

this increase of labor, the product of the land whose exploitation is the

more costly has as certain a sale as that of a piece of land whose exploitation

is cheaper. As competition levels the market price, the product of the

better soil will be paid for as dearly as that of the inferior. It is the

excess of the price of the products of the better soil over the cost of

their production that constitutes rent. If one could always have at one's

disposal plots of land of the same degree of fertility; if one could, as

in manufacturing industry, have recourse continually to cheaper and more

productive machines, or if the subsequent outlays of capital produced as

much as the first, then the price of agricultural products would be determined

by the price of commodities produced by the best instruments of production,

as we have seen with the price of manufactured products. But, from this

moment rent would have disappeared also.



<P>&nbsp;For the Ricardian doctrine -- "once the premises granted" [Marx

penned these words into the copy he gave N. Utina] -- to be generally true,

it is moreover essential that capital should be freely applicable to different

branches of industry; that a strongly developed competition among the capitalists

should have brought profits to an equal level; that the farmer should be

no more than an industrial capitalist claiming for the use of his capital

on inferior land [Marx scratched out the word "inferior" in the copy he

gave N. Utina], a profit equal to that which he would draw from his capital

if it were applied in any kind of manufacture; that agricultural exploitation

should be subjected to the regime of large-scale industry; and finally,

that the landowner himself should aim at nothing beyond the money return.



<P>&nbsp;It may happen, as in Ireland, that rent does not yet exist, although

the letting of land has reached an extreme development there. Rent being

the excess not only over wages, but also over industrial profit, it cannot

exist where the landowner's revenue is nothing but a mere levy on wages.



<P>&nbsp;Thus, far from converting the exploiter of the land, the farmer,

into a <I>simple laborer</I>, and "snatching from the cultivator the surplus

of his product, which he cannot help regarding as his own", rent confronts

the landowner, not with the slave, the serf, the payer of tribute, the

wage laborer, but with the industrial capitalist.



<P>&nbsp;Once constituted as ground rent, ground property has in its possession

only the surplus over production costs, which are determined not only by

wages but also by industrial profit. It is therefore from the landowner

that ground rent snatched a part of his income. Thus, there was a big lapse

of time before the feudal farmer was replaced by the industrial capitalist.

In Germany, for example, this transformation began only in the last third

of the 18th century. It is in England alone that this relation between

the industrial capitalist and the landed proprietor has been fully developed.



<P>&nbsp;So long as there was only M. Proudhon's <I>colonus</I>, there

was no rent. There moment rent exists, the <I>colonus</I> is no longer

the farmer, but the worker, the farmer's <I>colonus</I>. The abasement

of the laborer, reduced to the role of a simple worker, day laborer, wage-earner,

working for the industrial capitalist; the invention of the industrial

capitalist, exploiting the land like any other factory; the transformation

of the landed proprietor from a petty sovereign into a vulgar usurer; these

are the different relations expressed by rent.



<P>&nbsp;Rent, in the Ricardian sense, is patriarchal agriculture transformed

into commercial industry, industrial capital applied to land, the town

bourgeoisie transplanted into the country. Rent, instead of <I>binding

man to nature</I>, has merely bound the exploitation of the land to competition.

Once established as rent, landed property itself is the <I>result of competition</I>,

since from that time onwards it depends on the market value of agricultural

produce. As rent, landed property is mobilized and becomes an article of

commerce. Rent is possible only from the moment when the development of

urban industry, and the social organization resulting therefrom, force

the landowner to aim solely at cash profits, at the monetary relation of

his agricultural products -- in fact to look upon his landed property only

as a machine for coining money. Rent has so completely divorced the landed

proprietor from the soil, from nature, that he has no need even to know

his estates, as is to be seen in England. As for the farmer, the industrial

capitalist and the agricultural worker, they are no more bound to the land

they exploit than are the employer and the worker in the factories to the

cotton and wool they manufacture; they feel an attachment only for the

price of their production, the monetary product. Hence the jeremiads of

the reactionary parties, who offer up all their prayers for the return

of feudalism, of the good old patriarchal life, of the simple manners and

the fine virtues of our forefathers. The subjection of the soil to the

laws which dominate all other industries is and always will be the subject

of interested condolences. Thus it may be said that rent has become the

motive power which has introduced idyll into the movement of history.



<P>&nbsp;Ricardo, after postulating bourgeois production as necessary for

determining rent, applies the conception of rent, nevertheless, to the

landed property of all ages and all countries. This is an error common

to all the economists, who represent the bourgeois relations of production

as eternal categories.



<P>&nbsp;From the providential aim of rent -- which is, for M. Proudhon,

the transformation of the <I>colonus</I> into a <I>responsible worker</I>,

he passes to the equalized reward of rent.



<P>&nbsp;Rent, as we have just seen, is constituted by the <I>equal price</I>

of the products of lands of <I>unequal fertility</I>, so that a hectolitre

of corn which has cost 10 francs is sold for 20 francs if the cost of production

rises to 20 francs upon soil of inferior quality.



<P>&nbsp;So long as necessity forces the purchase of all the agricultural

products into the market, the market price is determined by the cost of

the most expensive product. Thus it is this equalization of price, resulting

from competition and not from the different fertilities of the lands, that

secures to the owner of the better soil a rent for 10 francs for every

hectolitre that his tenant sells.



<P>&nbsp;Let us suppose for a moment that the price of corn is determined

by the labor time needed to produce it, and at once the hectolitre of corn

obtained from the better soil will sell at 10 francs, while the hectolitre

of corn obtained on the inferior soil will cost 20 francs. This being admitted,

the average market price will be 15 francs, whereas, according to the law

of competition, it is 20 francs. If the average price were 15 francs, there

would be no occassion for any distribution, whether equalized or otherwise,

for there would be no rent. Rent exists only when one can sell for 20 francs

the hectolitre of corn which has cost the producer 10 francs. M. Proudhon

supposes equality of the market price, with unequal costs of production,

in order to arrive at an equalized sharing out of the product of inequality.



<P>&nbsp;We understand such economists as Mill, Cherbuliez, Hilditch, and

others demanding that rent should be handed over to the state to serve

in place of taxes. That is a frank expression of the hatred the industrial

capitalist bears towards the landed proprietor, who seems to him a useless

thing, an excrescence upon the general body of bourgeois production.



<P>&nbsp;But first to make the price of the hectolitre of corn 20 francs

in order then to make a general distribution of the 10 francs overcharge

levied on the consumer, is indeed enough to make the <I>social genius</I>

pursue <I>its zigzag course mournfully</I> -- and knock its head against

some <I>corner</I>.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>Rent becomes, under M. Proudhon's pen, "an immense land valuation,

which is carried out contradictorily by land- owners and farmers... in

a higher interest, and whose ultimate result must be to equalize the possesion

of land between exploiters of the soil and the industrialists."

For any land valuation based upon rent to be of practical value, the conditions

of present society must not be departed from.



<P>&nbsp;Now, we have shown that the farm rent paid by the farmer to the

landlord expresses the rent with any exactitude only in the countries most

advanced in industry and commerce. And even this rent often includes interest

paid to the landlord on capital incorporated in the land. The location

of the land, the vicinity of towns, and many other circumstances influence

the farm rent and modify the ground rent. These peremptory reasons would

be enough to prove the inaccuracy of a land valuation based on rent.



<P>&nbsp;Thus history, far from supplying, in rent, a ready-made land valuation,

does nothing but change and turn topsy-turvy the land valuations already

made.



<P>&nbsp;Finally, fertility is not so natural a quality as might be thought;

it is closely bound up with the social relations of the time. A piece of

land may be very fertile for corn growing, and yet the market price may

decide the cultivator to turn it into an artificial pastureland and thus

render it infertile.



<P>&nbsp;M. Proudhon has improvised his land valuation, which has not even

the value of an ordinary land valuation, only to give substance to the

<I>providentially equalitarian aim</I> of rent.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="400" >

<TR>

<TD>"Rent," continues M. Proudhon, "is the interest paid on a capital which

never perishes, namely -- land. And as the capital is capable of no increase

in matter, but only of an indefinite improvement in its use, it comes about

that while the interest or profit on a loan (<I>mutuum</I>) tends to diminish

continually through abundance of capital, rent tends always to increase

through the perfecting of industry, from which results the improvement

in the use of the land.... Such, in its essence, is rent."

<P>&nbsp;</TD>

</TR>

</TABLE></CENTER>

This time, M. Proudhon sees in rent all the characteristics of interest,

save that it is derived from capital of a specific nature. This capital

is land, an eternal capital, "which is capable of no increase in matter,

but only an indefinite improvement in its use". In the progressive advance

of civilization, interest has a continual tendency to fall, whilst rent

continually tends to rise. Interest falls because of the abundance of capital;

rent rises owning to the improvements brought about in industry, which

results in an ever better utilization of land.



<P>&nbsp;Such, in its essence, is the opinion of M. Proudhon.



<P>&nbsp;Let us first examine how far it is true to say that rent is interest

on capital.



<P>&nbsp;For the landed proprietor himself, rent represents the interest

on the capital that the land has cost him, or that he would draw from it

if he sold it. But in buying or selling land he only buys or sells rent.

The price he pays to make himself a receiver of rent is regulated by the

rate of interest in general and has nothing to do with with actual nature

of rent. The interest on capital invested in land is in general lower lower

than the interest on capital invested in manufacture or commerce. Thus,

for those who make no distinction between the interest that the land represents

to the owner and the rent itself, the interest on land capital diminishes

still more than does the interest on other capital. But it is not a question

of the purchase or sale price of rent, of the marketable value of rent,

of capitalized rent, it is a question of rent itself.



<P>&nbsp;Farm rent can imply again, apart from rent proper, the interest

on the capital incorporated in the land. In this instance the landlord

receives this part of the farm rent, not as a landlord but as a capitalist;

but this is not the rent proper that we are to deal with.



<P>&nbsp;Land, so long as it is not exploited as a means of production,

is not capital. Land as capital can be increased just as much as all the

other instruments of production. Nothing is added to its matter, to use

M. Proudhon's language, but the lands which serve as instruments of production

are multiplied. The very fact of applying further outlays of capital to

land already transformed into means of production increases land as capital

without adding anything to land as matter -- that is, to the extent of

the land. M. Proudhon's land as matter is the Earth in its limitation.

As for the eternity he attributes to land, we grant readily it has this

virtue as matter. Land as capital is no more eternal than any other capital.



<P>&nbsp;Gold and silver, which yield interest, are just as lasting and

eternal as land. If the price of gold and silver falls, while that of land

keeps rising, this is certainly not because of its more or less eternal

nature.



<P>&nbsp;Land as capital is fixed capital; but fixed capital gets used

up just as much as circulating capital. Improvements to the land need production

and upkeep; they last only for a time; and this they have in common with

all other improvements used to transform matter into means of production.

If land as capital were eternal, some lands would present a very different

appearance from what they do today, and we should see the Roman Campagna,

Sicily, Palestine, in all the splendour of their former prosperity.



<P>&nbsp;There are even instances when land as capital might disappear,

even though the improvements remain incorporated in the land.



<P>&nbsp;In the first place, this occurs every time rent proper is wiped

out by the competition of new and more fertile soils; secondly, the improvements

which might have been valuable at one time cease to be of value the moment

they become universal owing to the development of agronomy.



<P>&nbsp;The representative of land as capital is not the landlord, but

the farmer. The proceeds yielded by land as capital are interest and industrial

profit, not rent. There are lands which yield such interest and profit

but still yield no rent.



<P>&nbsp;Briefly, land in so far as it yields interest, is land capital,

and as land capital it yields no rent, it is not landed property. Rent

results from the social relations in which the exploitation of the land

takes place. It cannot be a result of the more or less solid, more or less

durable nature of the soil. Rent is a product of society and not of the

soil.



<P>&nbsp;According to M. Proudhon, "improvement in the use of the land"

-- a consequence "of the perfecting of industry" -- causes the continual

rise in rent. On the contrary, this improvement causes its periodic fall.



<P>&nbsp;Wherein consists, in general, any improvement, whether in agriculture

or in manufacture?? In producing more with the same labor; in producing

as much, or even more, with less labor. Thanks to these improvements, the

farmer is spared from using a greater amount of labor for a relatively

smaller product. He has no need, therefore, to resort to inferior soils,

and installments of capital applied successively to the same soil remain

equally productive.



<P>&nbsp;Thus, these improvements, far from continually raising rent as

M. Proudhon says, become on the contrary so many temporary obstacles preventing

its rise.



<P>&nbsp;The English landowners of the 17th century were so well aware

of this truth, that they opposed the progress of agriculture for fear of

seeing their incomes diminish. (See Petty, an English economist of the

time of Charles II.)

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>e deny all these assertions, except that two and

two make four.



<P>&nbsp;In the first place, there is no <I>general rise in prices</I>.

If the price of everything doubles at the same time as wages, there is

no change in price, the only change is in terms.



<P>&nbsp;Then again, a general rise in wages can never produce a more or

less general rise in the price of goods. Actually, if every industry employed

the same number of workers in relation to fixed capital or to the instruments

used, a general rise in wages would produce a general fall in profits and

the current price of goods would undergo no alteration.



<P>&nbsp;But as the relation of manual labor to fixed capital is not the

same in different industries, all the industries which employ a relatively

greater mass of capital and fewer workers, will be forced sooner or later

to lower the price of their goods. In the opposite case, in which the price

of their goods is not lowered, their profit will rise above the common

rate of profits. Machines are not wage-earners. Therefore, the general

rise in wages will affect less those industries, which, compared with the

others, employ more machines than workers. But as competition always tends

to level the rate of profits, those profits which rise above the average

rate cannot but be transitory. Thus, apart from a few fluctuations, a general

rise in wages will lead, not as M. Proudhon says, to a general increase

in prices, but to a partial fall -- that is a fall in the current price

of the goods that are made chiefly with the help of machines.



<P>&nbsp;The rise and fall of profits and wages expresses merely the proportion

in which capitalists and workers share in the product of a day's work,

without influencing in most instances the price of the product. But that

"strikes followed by an increase in wages culminate in a general rise in

prices, in a dearth even" -- those are notions which can blossom only in

the brain of a poet who has not been understood.



<P>&nbsp;In England, strikes have regularly given rise to the invention

and application of new machines. Machines were, it may be said, the weapon

employed by the capitalist to quell the revolt of specialized labor. The

<I>self-acting mule</I>, the greatest invention of modern industry, put

out of action the spinners who were in revolt. If combinations and strikes

had no other effect than that of making the efforts of mechanical genius

react against them, they would still exercise an immense influence on the

development of industry.

Faucher... September 1845, that for some time the British workers have

got out the habit of combination, which is assuredly a progress for which

one cannot but congratu- late them: but this improvement in the morale

of the workers comes chiefly from their economic education. 'It is not

on the manufacturers,' cries a spinning-mill worker at a Bolton meeting,

'that wages depend. In periods of depression the masters are, so to speak,

merely the whip with which neces- sity arms itself, and whether they want

to or not, they have to deal blows. The regulative principle is the relation

of supply and demand; and the masters have not this power'....



<P>&nbsp;"Well done! " cries M. Proudhon. "These are well-trained workers,

model workers, etc., etc., etc. Such poverty did not exist in Britain;

it will not cross the Channel."

Of all the towns in England, Bolton is the one in which the radicalism

is the most developed. The Bolton workers are known to be the most revolutionary

of all. At the time of the great agitation in England for the abolition

of the Corn Laws, the English manufacturers thought that they could cope

with the landowners only by thrusting the workers to the fore. But as the

interests of the workers were no less opposed to those of the manufacturers

than the interests of the manufacturers were to those of the landowners,

it was natural that the manufacturers should fare badly in the workers'

meetings. What did the manufacturers do? To save appearances they organized

meetings composed, to a large extent, of foremen, of the small number of

workers who were devoted to them, and of the real <I>friends of trade</I>.

When later on the genuine workers tried, as in Bolton and Manchester, to

take part in these sham demonstrations, in order to protest against them,

they were forbidden admittance on the ground that it was a <I>ticket meeting</I>

-- a meeting to which only persons with entrance cards were admitted. Yet

the posters placarded on the walls had announced public meetings. Every

time one of these meetings was held, the manufacturers' newspapers gave

a pompous and detailed account of the speeches made. It goes without saying

that it was the foremen who made these speeches. The London papers reproduced

them word for word. M. Proudhon has the misfortune to take foremen for

ordinary workers, and enjoins them not to cross the Channel.



<P>&nbsp;If in 1844 and 1845 strikes drew less attention than before, it

was because 1844 and 1845 were the first two years of prosperity that British

industry had had since 1837. Nevertheless none of the <I>trades unions</I>

had been dissolved.



<P>&nbsp;Now let us listen to the foremen of Bolton. According to them

manufacturers have no command over wages because they have no command over

the price of products, and they have no command over the price of products

because they have no command over the world market. For this reason, they

wish it to be understood that combinations should not be formed to extort

an increase in wages from the masters. M. Proudhon, on the contrary, forbids

combinations for fear they should be followed by a rise in wages which

would bring with it a general dearth. We have no need to say that on one

point there is an <I>entente cordiale</I> between the foremen and M. Proudhon:

that a rise in wages is equivalent to a rise in the price of products.



<P>&nbsp;But is the fear of a dearth the true cause of M. Proudhon's rancour?

No. Quite simple, he is annoyed with the Bolton foremen because they determine

value by <I>supply and demand</I> and hardly take any account of <I>constituted

value</I>, of value which has passed into the state of constitution, of

the constitution of value, including permanent exchangeability and all

the other proportionalities of relations and relations of proportionality,

with Providence at their side.

M. Proudhon wants to pass off an article of the Penal Code as a necessary

and general result of bourgeois relations of production.



<P>&nbsp;In England, combination is authorized by an Act of Parliament,

and it is the economic system which has forced Parliament to grant this

legal authorization. In 1825, when, under the Minister Huskisson, Parliament

had to modify the law in order to bring it more and more into line with

the conditions resulting from free competition, it had of necessity to

abolish all laws forbidding combinations of workers. The more modern industry

and competition develop, the more elements there are which call forth and

strength combination, and as soon as combination becomes an economic fact,

daily gaining in solidity, it is bound before long to become a legal fact.



<P>&nbsp;Thus the article of the Penal Code proves at the most that modern

industry and competition were not yet well developed under the Constituent

Assembly and under the Empire. [Note: The laws in operation at that time

in France -- the so-called Le Chapelier law adopted in 1791 during the

bourgeois revolution by the Constituent Assembly and the criminal code

elaborated under the Napoleonic Empire -- forbade the workers to form labor

unions of to go on strike on pain of severe punishment. The prohibition

of trade unions was abolished in France as late as 1884.]



<P>&nbsp;Economists and Socialists [that is, the Socialists of that time:

the Fourierists in France, the Owenites in England -- Engels, 1885] are

in agreement on one point: the condemnation of <I>combination</I>. Only

they have different motives for their act of condemnation.



<P>&nbsp;The economists say to workers:



<P>&nbsp;Do not combine. By combination you hinder the regular progress

of industry, you prevent manufacturers from carrying out their orders,

you disturb trade and you precipitate the invasion of machines which, by

rendering your labor in part useless, force you to accept a still lower

wage. Besides, whatever you do, your wages will always be determined by

the relation of hands demanded to hands supplied, and it is an effort as

ridiculous as it is dangerous for you to revolt against the eternal laws

of political economy.



<P>&nbsp;The Socialists say to the workers:



<P>&nbsp;Do not combine, because what will you gain by it anyway? A rise

in wages? The economists will prove to you quite clearly that the few ha'pence

you may gain by it for a few moments if you succeed will be followed by

a permanent fall. Skilled calculators will prove to you that it would take

you years merely to recover, through the increase in your wages, the expenses

incurred for the organization and upkeep of the combinations.



<P>&nbsp;And we, as Socialists, tell you that, apart from the money question,

you will continue nonetheless to be workers, and the masters will still

continue to be the masters, just as before. So no combination! No politics!

For is not entering into combination engaging in politics?



<P>&nbsp;The economists want the workers to remain in society as it is

constituted and as it has been signed and sealed by them in their manuals.



<P>&nbsp;The Socialists want the workers to leave the old society alone,

the better to be able to enter the new society which they have prepared

for them with so much foresight.



<P>&nbsp;In spite of both of them, in spite of manuals and utopias, combination

has not yet ceased for an instant to go forward and grow with the development

and growth of modern industry. It has now reached such a stage, that the

degree to which combination has developed in any country clearly marks

the rank it occupies in the hierarchy of the world market. England, whose

industry has attained the highest degree of development, has the biggest

and best organized combinations.



<P>&nbsp;In England, they have not stopped at partial combinations which

have no other objective than a passing strike, and which disappear with

it. Permanent combinations have been formed, <I>trades unions</I>, which

serve as ramparts for the workers in their struggles with the employers.

And at the present time all these local trades unions find a rallying point

in the National Association of United Trades, the central committee of

which is in London, and which already numbers 80,000 members. [NAUT --

A trade union organization established in England in 1845. Its activities

did not extend beyond the scope of economic struggle for better conditions

of sale of labor power, for better labor laws. The Association existed

until the early '60s, but after 1851, it did not play an important part

in the trade union movement. -- ed.] the organization of these strikes,

combinations, and trades unions went on simultaneously with the political

struggles of the workers, who now constitute a large political party, under

the name of Chartists.



<P>&nbsp;The first attempt of workers to associate among themselves always

takes place in the form of combinations.



<P>&nbsp;Large-scale industry concentrates in one place a crowd of people

unknown to one another. Competition divides their interests. But the maintenance

of wages, this common interest which they have against their boss, unites

them in a common thought of resistance -- combination. Thus combination

always has a double aim, that of stopping competition among the workers,

so that they can carry on general competition with the capitalist. If the

first aim of resistance was merely the maintenance of wages, combinations,

at first isolated, constitute themselves into groups as the capitalists

in their turn unite for the purpose of repression, and in the face of always

united capital, the maintenance of the association becomes more necessary

to them than that of wages. This is so true that English economists are

amazed to see the workers sacrifice a good part of their wages in favor

of associations, which, in the eyes of these economists, are established

solely in favor of wages. In this struggle -- a veritable civil war --

all the elements necessary for a coming battle unite and develop. Once

it has reached this point, association takes on a political character.



<P>&nbsp;Economic conditions had first transformed the mass of the people

of the country into worker. The combination of capital has created for

this mass a common situation, common interests. This mass is thus already

a class as against capital, but not yet for itself. In the struggle, of

which we have noted only a few phases, this mass becomes united, and constitutes

itself as a class for itself. The interests it defends becomes class interests.

But the struggle of class against class is a political struggle.



<P>&nbsp;In the bourgeoisie we have two phases to distinguish: that in

which it constituted itself as a class under the regime of feudalism and

absolute monarchy, and that in which, already constituted as a class, it

overthrew feudalism and monarchy to make society into a bourgeois society.

The first of these phases was the longer and necessitated the greater efforts.

This too began by partial combinations against the feudal lords.



<P>&nbsp;Much research has been carried out to trace the different historical

phases that the bourgeoisie has passed through, from the commune up to

its constitution as a class.



<P>&nbsp;But when it is a question of making a precise study of strikes,

combinations and other forms in which the proletarians carry out before

our eyes their organization as a class, some are seized with real fear

and others display a <I>transcendental</I> disdain.



<P>&nbsp;An oppressed class is the vital condition for every society founded

on the antagonism of classes. The emancipation of the oppressed class thus

implies necessarily the creation of a new society. For the oppressed class

to be able to emancipate itself, it is necessary that the productive powers

already acquired and the existing social relations should no longer be

capable of existing side by side. Of all the instruments of production,

the greatest productive power is the revolutionary class itself. The organization

of revolutionary elements as a class supposes the existence of all the

productive forces which could be engendered in the bosom of the old society.



<P>&nbsp;Does this mean that after the fall of the old society there will

be a new class domination culminating in a new political power? No.



<P>&nbsp;The condition for the emancipation of the working class is the

abolition of every class, just as the condition for the liberation of the

third estate, of the bourgeois order, was the abolition of all estates

and all orders. [Estates here in the historical sense of the estates of

feudalism, estates with definite and limited privileges. The revolution

of the bourgeoisie abolished the estates and their privileges. Bourgeois

society knows only <I>classes</I>. It was, therefore, absolutely in contradiction

with history to describe the proletariat as the "fourth estate" -- Engels,

1885 German edition.]



<P>&nbsp;The working class, in the course of its development, will substitute

for the old civil society an association which will exclude classes and

their antagonism, and there will be no more political power properly so-called,

since political power is precisely the official expression of antagonism

in civil society.



<P>&nbsp;Meanwhile the antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie

is a struggle of class against class, a struggle which carried to its highest

expression is a total revolution. Indeed, is it at all surprising that

a society founded on the opposition of classes should culminate in brutal

<I>contradiction</I>, the shock of body against body, as its final denouement?



<P>&nbsp;Do not say that social movement excludes political movement. There

is never a political movement which is not at the same time social.



<P>&nbsp;It is only in an order of things in which there are no more classes

and class antagonisms that <I>social evolutions</I> will cease to be <I>political

revolutions</I>. Till then, on the eve of every general reshuffling of

society, the last word of social science will always be:
