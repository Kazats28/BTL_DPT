<BLOCKQUOTE>I, WHO erewhile the happy Garden sung

<BR>By one man's disobedience lost, now sing

<BR>Recovered Paradise to all mankind,

<BR>By one man's firm obedience fully tried

<BR>Through all temptation, and the Tempter foiled

<BR>In all his wiles, defeated and repulsed,

<BR>And Eden raised in the waste Wilderness.

<BR>Thou Spirit, who led'st this glorious Eremite

<BR>Into the desert, his victorious field

<BR>Against the spiritual foe, and brought'st him thence

<BR>By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire,

<BR>As thou art wont, my prompted song, else mute,

<BR>And bear through highth or depth of Nature's bounds,

<BR>With prosperous wing full summed, to tell of deeds

<BR>Above heroic, though in secret done,

<BR>And unrecorded left through many an age:

<BR>Worthy to have not remained so long unsung.

<BR>Now had the great Proclaimer, with a voice

<BR>More awful than the sound of trumpet, cried

<BR>Repentance, and Heaven's kingdom nigh at hand

<BR>To all baptized. To his great baptism flocked

<BR>With awe the regions round, and with them came

<BR>From Nazareth the son of Joseph deemed

<BR>To the flood Jordan--came as then obscure,

<BR>Unmarked, unknown. But him the Baptist soon

<BR>Descried, divinely warned, and witness bore

<BR>As to his worthier, and would have resigned

<BR>To him his heavenly office. Nor was long

<BR>His witness unconfirmed: on him baptized

<BR>Heaven opened, and in likeness of a Dove

<BR>The Spirit descended, while the Father's voice

<BR>From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son.

<BR>That heard the Adversary, who, roving still

<BR>About the world, at that assembly famed

<BR>Would not be last, and, with the voice divine

<BR>Nigh thunder-struck, the exalted man to whom

<BR>Such high attest was given a while surveyed

<BR>With wonder; then, with envy fraught and rage,

<BR>Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air

<BR>To council summons all his mighty Peers,

<BR>Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved,

<BR>A gloomy consistory; and them amidst,

<BR>With looks aghast and sad, he thus bespake:--

<BR>"O ancient Powers of Air and this wide World

<BR>(For much more willingly I mention Air,

<BR>This our old conquest, than remember Hell,

<BR>Our hated habitation), well ye know

<BR>How many ages, as the years of men,

<BR>This Universe we have possessed, and ruled

<BR>In manner at our will the affairs of Earth,

<BR>Since Adam and his facile consort Eve

<BR>Lost Paradise, deceived by me, though since

<BR>With dread attending when that fatal wound

<BR>Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve

<BR>Upon my head. Long the decrees of Heaven

<BR>Delay, for longest time to Him is short;

<BR>And now, too soon for us, the circling hours

<BR>This dreaded time have compassed, wherein we

<BR>Must bide the stroke of that long-threatened wound

<BR>(At least, if so we can, and by the head

<BR>Broken be not intended all our power

<BR>To be infringed, our freedom and our being

<BR>In this fair empire won of Earth and Air)--

<BR>For this ill news I bring: The Woman's Seed,

<BR>Destined to this, is late of woman born.

<BR>His birth to our just fear gave no small cause;

<BR>But his growth now to youth's full flower, displaying

<BR>All virtue, grace and wisdom to achieve

<BR>Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear.

<BR>Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim

<BR>His coming, is sent harbinger, who all

<BR>Invites, and in the consecrated stream

<BR>Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so

<BR>Purified to receive him pure, or rather

<BR>To do him honour as their King. All come,

<BR>And he himself among them was baptized--

<BR>Not thence to be more pure, but to receive

<BR>The testimony of Heaven, that who he is

<BR>Thenceforth the nations may not doubt. I saw

<BR>The Prophet do him reverence; on him, rising

<BR>Out of the water, Heaven above the clouds

<BR>Unfold her crystal doors; thence on his head

<BR>A perfet Dove descend (whate'er it meant);

<BR>And out of Heaven the sovraign voice I heard,

<BR>'This is my Son beloved,--in him am pleased.'

<BR>His mother, than, is mortal, but his Sire

<BR>He who obtains the monarchy of Heaven;

<BR>And what will He not do to advance his Son?

<BR>His first-begot we know, and sore have felt,

<BR>When his fierce thunder drove us to the Deep;

<BR>Who this is we must learn, for Man he seems

<BR>In all his lineaments, though in his face

<BR>The glimpses of his Father's glory shine.

<BR>Ye see our danger on the utmost edge

<BR>Of hazard, which admits no long debate,

<BR>But must with something sudden be opposed

<BR>(Not force, but well-couched fraud, well-woven snares),

<BR>Ere in the head of nations he appear,

<BR>Their king, their leader, and supreme on Earth.

<BR>I, when no other durst, sole undertook

<BR>The dismal expedition to find out

<BR>And ruin Adam, and the exploit performed

<BR>Successfully: a calmer voyage now

<BR>Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once

<BR>Induces best to hope of like success."

<BR>He ended, and his words impression left

<BR>Of much amazement to the infernal crew,

<BR>Distracted and surprised with deep dismay

<BR>At these sad tidings. But no time was then

<BR>For long indulgence to their fears or grief:

<BR>Unanimous they all commit the care

<BR>And management of this man enterprise

<BR>To him, their great Dictator, whose attempt

<BR>At first against mankind so well had thrived

<BR>In Adam's overthrow, and led their march

<BR>From Hell's deep-vaulted den to dwell in light,

<BR>Regents, and potentates, and kings, yea gods,

<BR>Of many a pleasant realm and province wide.

<BR>So to the coast of Jordan he directs

<BR>His easy steps, girded with snaky wiles,

<BR>Where he might likeliest find this new-declared,

<BR>This man of men, attested Son of God,

<BR>Temptation and all guile on him to try--

<BR>So to subvert whom he suspected raised

<BR>To end his reign on Earth so long enjoyed:

<BR>But, contrary, unweeting he fulfilled

<BR>The purposed counsel, pre-ordained and fixed,

<BR>Of the Most High, who, in full frequence bright

<BR>Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake:--

<BR>"Gabriel, this day, by proof, thou shalt behold,

<BR>Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth

<BR>With Man or men's affairs, how I begin

<BR>To verify that solemn message late,

<BR>On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure

<BR>In Galilee, that she should bear a son,

<BR>Great in renown, and called the Son of God.

<BR>Then told'st her, doubting how these things could be

<BR>To her a virgin, that on her should come

<BR>The Holy Ghost, and the power of the Highest

<BR>O'ershadow her. This Man, born and now upgrown,

<BR>To shew him worthy of his birth divine

<BR>And high prediction, henceforth I expose

<BR>To Satan; let him tempt, and now assay

<BR>His utmost subtlety, because he boasts

<BR>And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng

<BR>Of his Apostasy. He might have learnt

<BR>Less overweening, since he failed in Job,

<BR>Whose constant perseverance overcame

<BR>Whate'er his cruel malice could invent.

<BR>He now shall know I can produce a man,

<BR>Of female seed, far abler to resist

<BR>All his solicitations, and at length

<BR>All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell--

<BR>Winning by conquest what the first man lost

<BR>By fallacy surprised. But first I mean

<BR>To exercise him in the Wilderness;

<BR>There he shall first lay down the rudiments

<BR>Of his great warfare, ere I send him forth

<BR>To conquer Sin and Death, the two grand foes.

<BR>By humiliation and strong sufferance

<BR>His weakness shall o'ercome Satanic strength,

<BR>And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh;

<BR>That all the Angels and aethereal Powers--

<BR>They now, and men hereafter--may discern

<BR>From what consummate virtue I have chose

<BR>This perfet man, by merit called my Son,

<BR>To earn salvation for the sons of men."

<BR>So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven

<BR>Admiring stood a space; then into hymns

<BR>Burst forth, and in celestial measures moved,

<BR>Circling the throne and singing, while the hand

<BR>Sung with the voice, and this the argument:--

<BR>"Victory and triumph to the Son of God,

<BR>Now entering his great duel, not of arms,

<BR>But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles!

<BR>The Father knows the Son; therefore secure

<BR>Ventures his filial virtue, though untried,

<BR>Against whate'er may tempt, whate'er seduce,

<BR>Allure, or terrify, or undermine.

<BR>Be frustrate, all ye stratagems of Hell,

<BR>And, devilish machinations, come to nought!"

<BR>So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned.

<BR>Meanwhile the Son of God, who yet some days

<BR>Lodged in Bethabara, where John baptized,

<BR>Musing and much revolving in his breast

<BR>How best the mighty work he might begin

<BR>Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first

<BR>Publish his godlike office now mature,

<BR>One day forth walked alone, the Spirit leading

<BR>And his deep thoughts, the better to converse

<BR>With solitude, till, far from track of men,

<BR>Thought following thought, and step by step led on,

<BR>He entered now the bordering Desert wild,

<BR>And, with dark shades and rocks environed round,

<BR>His holy meditations thus pursued:--

<BR>"O what a multitude of thoughts at once

<BR>Awakened in me swarm, while I consider

<BR>What from within I feel myself, and hear

<BR>What from without comes often to my ears,

<BR>Ill sorting with my present state compared!

<BR>When I was yet a child, no childish play

<BR>To me was pleasing; all my mind was set

<BR>Serious to learn and know, and thence to do,

<BR>What might be public good; myself I thought

<BR>Born to that end, born to promote all truth,

<BR>All righteous things. Therefore, above my years,

<BR>The Law of God I read, and found it sweet;

<BR>Made it my whole delight, and in it grew

<BR>To such perfection that, ere yet my age

<BR>Had measured twice six years, at our great Feast

<BR>I went into the Temple, there to hear

<BR>The teachers of our Law, and to propose

<BR>What might improve my knowledge or their own,

<BR>And was admired by all. Yet this not all

<BR>To which my spirit aspired. Victorious deeds

<BR>Flamed in my heart, heroic acts--one while

<BR>To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke;

<BR>Then to subdue and quell, o'er all the earth,

<BR>Brute violence and proud tyrannic power,

<BR>Till truth were freed, and equity restored:

<BR>Yet held it more humane, more heavenly, first

<BR>By winning words to conquer willing hearts,

<BR>And make persuasion do the work of fear;

<BR>At least to try, and teach the erring soul,

<BR>Not wilfully misdoing, but unware

<BR>Misled; the stubborn only to subdue.

<BR>These growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving,

<BR>By words at times cast forth, inly rejoiced,

<BR>And said to me apart, 'High are thy thoughts,

<BR>O Son! but nourish them, and let them soar

<BR>To what highth sacred virtue and true worth

<BR>Can raise them, though above example high;

<BR>By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire.

<BR>For know, thou art no son of mortal man;

<BR>Though men esteem thee low of parentage,

<BR>Thy Father is the Eternal King who rules

<BR>All Heaven and Earth, Angels and sons of men.

<BR>A messenger from God foretold thy birth

<BR>Conceived in me a virgin; he foretold

<BR>Thou shouldst be great, and sit on David's throne,

<BR>And of thy kingdom there should be no end.

<BR>At thy nativity a glorious quire

<BR>Of Angels, in the fields of Bethlehem, sung

<BR>To shepherds, watching at their folds by night,

<BR>And told them the Messiah now was born,

<BR>Where they might see him; and to thee they came,

<BR>Directed to the manger where thou lay'st;

<BR>For in the inn was left no better room.

<BR>A Star, not seen before, in heaven appearing,

<BR>Guided the Wise Men thither from the East,

<BR>To honour thee with incense, myrrh, and gold;

<BR>By whose bright course led on they found the place,

<BR>Affirming it thy star, new-graven in heaven,

<BR>By which they knew thee King of Israel born.

<BR>Just Simeon and prophetic Anna, warned

<BR>By vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake,

<BR>Before the altar and the vested priest,

<BR>Like things of thee to all that present stood.'

<BR>This having heart, straight I again revolved

<BR>The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ

<BR>Concerning the Messiah, to our scribes

<BR>Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake

<BR>I am--this chiefly, that my way must lie

<BR>Through many a hard assay, even to the death,

<BR>Ere I the promised kingdom can attain,

<BR>Or work redemption for mankind, whose sins'

<BR>Full weight must be transferred upon my head.

<BR>Yet, neither thus disheartened or dismayed,

<BR>The time prefixed I waited; when behold

<BR>The Baptist (of whose birth I oft had heard,

<BR>Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come

<BR>Before Messiah, and his way prepare!

<BR>I, as all others, to his baptism came,

<BR>Which I believed was from above; but he

<BR>Straight knew me, and with loudest voice proclaimed

<BR>Me him (for it was shewn him so from Heaven)--

<BR>Me him whose harbinger he was; and first

<BR>Refused on me his baptism to confer,

<BR>As much his greater, and was hardly won.

<BR>But, as I rose out of the laving stream,

<BR>Heaven opened her eternal doors, from whence

<BR>The Spirit descended on me like a Dove;

<BR>And last, the sum of all, my Father's voice,

<BR>Audibly heard from Heaven, pronounced me his,

<BR>Me his beloved Son, in whom alone

<BR>He was well pleased: by which I knew the time

<BR>Now full, that I no more should live obscure,

<BR>But openly begin, as best becomes

<BR>The authority which I derived from Heaven.

<BR>And now by some strong motion I am led

<BR>Into this wilderness; to what intent

<BR>I learn not yet. Perhaps I need not know;

<BR>For what concerns my knowledge God reveals."

<BR>So spake our Morning Star, then in his rise,

<BR>And, looking round, on every side beheld

<BR>A pathless desert, dusk with horrid shades.

<BR>The way he came, not having marked return,

<BR>Was difficult, by human steps untrod;

<BR>And he still on was led, but with such thoughts

<BR>Accompanied of things past and to come

<BR>Lodged in his breast as well might recommend

<BR>Such solitude before choicest society.

<BR>Full forty days he passed--whether on hill

<BR>Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night

<BR>Under the covert of some ancient oak

<BR>Or cedar to defend him from the dew,

<BR>Or harboured in one cave, is not revealed;

<BR>Nor tasted human food, nor hunger felt,

<BR>Till those days ended; hungered then at last

<BR>Among wild beasts. They at his sight grew mild,

<BR>Nor sleeping him nor waking harmed; his walk

<BR>The fiery serpent fled and noxious worm;

<BR>The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof.

<BR>But now an aged man in rural weeds,

<BR>Following, as seemed, the quest of some stray eye,

<BR>Or withered sticks to gather, which might serve

<BR>Against a winter's day, when winds blow keen,

<BR>To warm him wet returned from field at eve,

<BR>He saw approach; who first with curious eye

<BR>Perused him, then with words thus uttered spake:--

<BR>"Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place,

<BR>So far from path or road of men, who pass

<BR>In troop or caravan? for single none

<BR>Durst ever, who returned, and dropt not here

<BR>His carcass, pined with hunger and with droughth.

<BR>I ask the rather, and the more admire,

<BR>For that to me thou seem'st the man whom late

<BR>Our new baptizing Prophet at the ford

<BR>Of Jordan honoured so, and called thee Son

<BR>Of God. I saw and heard, for we sometimes

<BR>Who dwell this wild, constrained by want, come forth

<BR>To town or village nigh (nighest is far),

<BR>Where aught we hear, and curious are to hear,

<BR>What happens new; fame also finds us out."

<BR>To whom the Son of God:--"Who brought me hither

<BR>Will bring me hence; no other guide I seek."

<BR>"By miracle he may," replied the swain;

<BR>"What other way I see not; for we here

<BR>Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inured

<BR>More than the camel, and to drink go far--

<BR>Men to much misery and hardship born.

<BR>But, if thou be the Son of God, command

<BR>That out of these hard stones be made thee bread;

<BR>So shalt thou save thyself, and us relieve

<BR>With food, whereof we wretched seldom taste."

<BR>He ended, and the Son of God replied:--

<BR>"Think'st thou such force in bread? Is it not written

<BR>(For I discern thee other than thou seem'st),

<BR>Man lives not by bread only, but each word

<BR>Proceeding from the mouth of God, who fed

<BR>Our fathers here with manna? In the Mount

<BR>Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank;

<BR>And forty days Eliah without food

<BR>Wandered this barren waste; the same I now.

<BR>Why dost thou, then, suggest to me distrust

<BR>Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art?"

<BR>Whom thus answered the Arch-Fiend, now undisguised:--

<BR>"'Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate

<BR>Who, leagued with millions more in rash revolt,

<BR>Kept not my happy station, but was driven

<BR>With them from bliss to the bottomless Deep--

<BR>Yet to that hideous place not so confined

<BR>By rigour unconniving but that oft,

<BR>Leaving my dolorous prison, I enjoy

<BR>Large liberty to round this globe of Earth,

<BR>Or range in the Air; nor from the Heaven of Heavens

<BR>Hath he excluded my resort sometimes.

<BR>I came, among the Sons of God, when he

<BR>Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job,

<BR>To prove him, and illustrate his high worth;

<BR>And, when to all his Angels he proposed

<BR>To draw the proud king Ahab into fraud,

<BR>That he might fall in Ramoth, they demurring,

<BR>I undertook that office, and the tongues

<BR>Of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies

<BR>To his destruction, as I had in charge:

<BR>For what he bids I do. Though I have lost

<BR>Much lustre of my native brightness, lost

<BR>To be beloved of God, I have not lost

<BR>To love, at least contemplate and admire,

<BR>What I see excellent in good, or fair,

<BR>Or virtuous; I should so have lost all sense.

<BR>What can be then less in me than desire

<BR>To see thee and approach thee, whom I know

<BR>Declared the Son of God, to hear attent

<BR>Thy wisdom, and behold thy godlike deeds?

<BR>Men generally think me much a foe

<BR>To all mankind. Why should I? they to me

<BR>Never did wrong or violence. By them

<BR>I lost not what I lost; rather by them

<BR>I gained what I have gained, and with them dwell

<BR>Copartner in these regions of the World,

<BR>If not disposer--lend them oft my aid,

<BR>Oft my advice by presages and signs,

<BR>And answers, oracles, portents, and dreams,

<BR>Whereby they may direct their future life.

<BR>Envy, they say, excites me, thus to gain

<BR>Companions of my misery and woe!

<BR>At first it may be; but, long since with woe

<BR>Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof

<BR>That fellowship in pain divides not smart,

<BR>Nor lightens aught each man's peculiar load;

<BR>Small consolation, then, were Man adjoined.

<BR>This wounds me most (what can it less?) that Man,

<BR>Man fallen, shall be restored, I never more."

<BR>To whom our Saviour sternly thus replied:--

<BR>"Deservedly thou griev'st, composed of lies

<BR>From the beginning, and in lies wilt end,

<BR>Who boast'st release from Hell, and leave to come

<BR>Into the Heaven of Heavens. Thou com'st, indeed,

<BR>As a poor miserable captive thrall

<BR>Comes to the place where he before had sat

<BR>Among the prime in splendour, now deposed,

<BR>Ejected, emptied, gazed, unpitied, shunned,

<BR>A spectacle of ruin, or of scorn,

<BR>To all the host of Heaven. The happy place

<BR>Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy--

<BR>Rather inflames thy torment, representing

<BR>Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable;

<BR>So never more in Hell than when in Heaven.

<BR>But thou art serviceable to Heaven's King!

<BR>Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear

<BR>Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites?

<BR>What but thy malice moved thee to misdeem

<BR>Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him

<BR>With all inflictions? but his patience won.

<BR>The other service was thy chosen task,

<BR>To be a liar in four hundred mouths;

<BR>For lying is thy sustenance, thy food.

<BR>Yet thou pretend'st to truth! all oracles

<BR>By thee are given, and what confessed more true

<BR>Among the nations? That hath been thy craft,

<BR>By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies.

<BR>But what have been thy answers? what but dark,

<BR>Ambiguous, and with double sense deluding,

<BR>Which they who asked have seldom understood,

<BR>And, not well understood, as good not known?

<BR>Who ever, by consulting at thy shrine,

<BR>Returned the wiser, or the more instruct

<BR>To fly or follow what concerned him most,

<BR>And run not sooner to his fatal snare?

<BR>For God hath justly given the nations up

<BR>To thy delusions; justly, since they fell

<BR>Idolatrous. But, when his purpose is

<BR>Among them to declare his providence,

<BR>To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth,

<BR>But from him, or his Angels president

<BR>In every province, who, themselves disdaining

<BR>To approach thy temples, give thee in command

<BR>What, to the smallest tittle, thou shalt say

<BR>To thy adorers? Thou, with trembling fear,

<BR>Or like a fawning parasite, obey'st;

<BR>Then to thyself ascrib'st the truth foretold.

<BR>But this thy glory shall be soon retrenched;

<BR>No more shalt thou by oracling abuse

<BR>The Gentiles; henceforth oracles are ceased,

<BR>And thou no more with pomp and sacrifice

<BR>Shalt be enquired at Delphos or elsewhere--

<BR>At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute.

<BR>God hath now sent his living Oracle

<BR>Into the world to teach his final will,

<BR>And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell

<BR>In pious hearts, an inward oracle

<BR>To all truth requisite for men to know."

<BR>So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend,

<BR>Though inly stung with anger and disdain,

<BR>Dissembled, and this answer smooth returned:--

<BR>"Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke,

<BR>And urged me hard with doings which not will,

<BR>But misery, hath wrested from me. Where

<BR>Easily canst thou find one miserable,

<BR>And not inforced oft-times to part from truth,

<BR>If it may stand him more in stead to lie,

<BR>Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure?

<BR>But thou art placed above me; thou art Lord;

<BR>From thee I can, and must, submiss, endure

<BR>Cheek or reproof, and glad to scape so quit.

<BR>Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk,

<BR>Smooth on the tongue discoursed, pleasing to the ear,

<BR>And tunable as sylvan pipe or song;

<BR>What wonder, then, if I delight to hear

<BR>Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire

<BR>Virtue who follow not her lore. Permit me

<BR>To hear thee when I come (since no man comes),

<BR>And talk at least, though I despair to attain.

<BR>Thy Father, who is holy, wise, and pure,

<BR>Suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest

<BR>To tread his sacred courts, and minister

<BR>About his altar, handling holy things,

<BR>Praying or vowing, and voutsafed his voice

<BR>To Balaam reprobate, a prophet yet

<BR>Inspired: disdain not such access to me."

<BR>To whom our Saviour, with unaltered brow:--

<BR>"Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope,

<BR>I bid not, or forbid. Do as thou find'st

<BR>Permission from above; thou canst not more."

<BR>He added not; and Satan, bowling low

<BR>His gray dissimulation, disappeared,

<BR>Into thin air diffused: for now began

<BR>Night with her sullen wing to double-shade

<BR>The desert; fowls in their clay nests were couched;

<BR>And now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Book 4</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>Perplexed and troubled at his bad success

<BR>The Tempter stood, nor had what to reply,

<BR>Discovered in his fraud, thrown from his hope

<BR>So oft, and the persuasive rhetoric

<BR>That sleeked his tongue, and won so much on Eve,

<BR>So little here, nay lost. But Eve was Eve;

<BR>This far his over-match, who, self-deceived

<BR>And rash, beforehand had no better weighed

<BR>The strength he was to cope with, or his own.

<BR>But--as a man who had been matchless held

<BR>In cunning, over-reached where least he thought,

<BR>To salve his credit, and for very spite,

<BR>Still will be tempting him who foils him still,

<BR>And never cease, though to his shame the more;

<BR>Or as a swarm of flies in vintage-time,

<BR>About the wine-press where sweet must is poured,

<BR>Beat off, returns as oft with humming sound;

<BR>Or surging waves against a solid rock,

<BR>Though all to shivers dashed, the assault renew,

<BR>(Vain battery!) and in froth or bubbles end--

<BR>So Satan, whom repulse upon repulse

<BR>Met ever, and to shameful silence brought,

<BR>Yet gives not o'er, though desperate of success,

<BR>And his vain importunity pursues.

<BR>He brought our Saviour to the western side

<BR>Of that high mountain, whence he might behold

<BR>Another plain, long, but in breadth not wide,

<BR>Washed by the southern sea, and on the north

<BR>To equal length backed with a ridge of hills

<BR>That screened the fruits of the earth and seats of men

<BR>From cold Septentrion blasts; thence in the midst

<BR>Divided by a river, off whose banks

<BR>On each side an Imperial City stood,

<BR>With towers and temples proudly elevate

<BR>On seven small hills, with palaces adorned,

<BR>Porches and theatres, baths, aqueducts,

<BR>Statues and trophies, and triumphal arcs,

<BR>Gardens and groves, presented to his eyes

<BR>Above the highth of mountains interposed--

<BR>By what strange parallax, or optic skill

<BR>Of vision, multiplied through air, or glass

<BR>Of telescope, were curious to enquire.

<BR>And now the Tempter thus his silence broke:--

<BR>"The city which thou seest no other deem

<BR>Than great and glorious Rome, Queen of the Earth

<BR>So far renowned, and with the spoils enriched

<BR>Of nations. There the Capitol thou seest,

<BR>Above the rest lifting his stately head

<BR>On the Tarpeian rock, her citadel

<BR>Impregnable; and there Mount Palatine,

<BR>The imperial palace, compass huge, and high

<BR>The structure, skill of noblest architects,

<BR>With gilded battlements, conspicuous far,

<BR>Turrets, and terraces, and glittering spires.

<BR>Many a fair edifice besides, more like

<BR>Houses of gods--so well I have disposed

<BR>My aerie microscope--thou may'st behold,

<BR>Outside and inside both, pillars and roofs

<BR>Carved work, the hand of famed artificers

<BR>In cedar, marble, ivory, or gold.

<BR>Thence to the gates cast round thine eye, and see

<BR>What conflux issuing forth, or entering in:

<BR>Praetors, proconsuls to their provinces

<BR>Hasting, or on return, in robes of state;

<BR>Lictors and rods, the ensigns of their power;

<BR>Legions and cohorts, turms of horse and wings;

<BR>Or embassies from regions far remote,

<BR>In various habits, on the Appian road,

<BR>Or on the AEmilian--some from farthest south,

<BR>Syene, and where the shadow both way falls,

<BR>Meroe, Nilotic isle, and, more to west,

<BR>The realm of Bocchus to the Blackmoor sea;

<BR>From the Asian kings (and Parthian among these),

<BR>From India and the Golden Chersoness,

<BR>And utmost Indian isle Taprobane,

<BR>Dusk faces with white silken turbants wreathed;

<BR>From Gallia, Gades, and the British west;

<BR>Germans, and Scythians, and Sarmatians north

<BR>Beyond Danubius to the Tauric pool.

<BR>All nations now to Rome obedience pay--

<BR>To Rome's great Emperor, whose wide domain,

<BR>In ample territory, wealth and power,

<BR>Civility of manners, arts and arms,

<BR>And long renown, thou justly may'st prefer

<BR>Before the Parthian. These two thrones except,

<BR>The rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the sight,

<BR>Shared among petty kings too far removed;

<BR>These having shewn thee, I have shewn thee all

<BR>The kingdoms of the world, and all their glory.

<BR>This Emperor hath no son, and now is old,

<BR>Old and lascivious, and from Rome retired

<BR>To Capreae, an island small but strong

<BR>On the Campanian shore, with purpose there

<BR>His horrid lusts in private to enjoy;

<BR>Committing to a wicked favourite

<BR>All public cares, and yet of him suspicious;

<BR>Hated of all, and hating. With what ease,

<BR>Endued with regal virtues as thou art,

<BR>Appearing, and beginning noble deeds,

<BR>Might'st thou expel this monster from his throne,

<BR>Now made a sty, and, in his place ascending,

<BR>A victor-people free from servile yoke!

<BR>And with my help thou may'st; to me the power

<BR>Is given, and by that right I give it thee.

<BR>Aim, therefore, at no less than all the world;

<BR>Aim at the highest; without the highest attained,

<BR>Will be for thee no sitting, or not long,

<BR>On David's throne, be prophesied what will."

<BR>To whom the Son of God, unmoved, replied:--

<BR>"Nor doth this grandeur and majestic shew

<BR>Of luxury, though called magnificence,

<BR>More than of arms before, allure mine eye,

<BR>Much less my mind; though thou should'st add to tell

<BR>Their sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous feasts

<BR>On citron tables or Atlantic stone

<BR>(For I have also heard, perhaps have read),

<BR>Their wines of Setia, Cales, and Falerne,

<BR>Chios and Crete, and how they quaff in gold,

<BR>Crystal, and myrrhine cups, imbossed with gems

<BR>And studs of pearl--to me should'st tell, who thirst

<BR>And hunger still. Then embassies thou shew'st

<BR>From nations far and nigh! What honour that,

<BR>But tedious waste of time, to sit and hear

<BR>So many hollow compliments and lies,

<BR>Outlandish flatteries? Then proceed'st to talk

<BR>Of the Emperor, how easily subdued,

<BR>How gloriously. I shall, thou say'st, expel

<BR>A brutish monster: what if I withal

<BR>Expel a Devil who first made him such?

<BR>Let his tormentor, Conscience, find him out;

<BR>For him I was not sent, nor yet to free

<BR>That people, victor once, now vile and base,

<BR>Deservedly made vassal--who, once just,

<BR>Frugal, and mild, and temperate, conquered well,

<BR>But govern ill the nations under yoke,

<BR>Peeling their provinces, exhausted all

<BR>By lust and rapine; first ambitious grown

<BR>Of triumph, that insulting vanity;

<BR>Then cruel, by their sports to blood inured

<BR>Of fighting beasts, and men to beasts exposed;

<BR>Luxurious by their wealth, and greedier still,

<BR>And from the daily Scene effeminate.

<BR>What wise and valiant man would seek to free

<BR>These, thus degenerate, by themselves enslaved,

<BR>Or could of inward slaves make outward free?

<BR>Know, therefore, when my season comes to sit

<BR>On David's throne, it shall be like a tree

<BR>Spreading and overshadowing all the earth,

<BR>Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash

<BR>All monarchies besides throughout the world;

<BR>And of my Kingdom there shall be no end.

<BR>Means there shall be to this; but what the means

<BR>Is not for thee to know, nor me to tell."

<BR>To whom the Tempter, impudent, replied:--

<BR>"I see all offers made by me how slight

<BR>Thou valuest, because offered, and reject'st.

<BR>Nothing will please the difficult and nice,

<BR>Or nothing more than still to contradict.

<BR>On the other side know also thou that I

<BR>On what I offer set as high esteem,

<BR>Nor what I part with mean to give for naught,

<BR>All these, which in a moment thou behold'st,

<BR>The kingdoms of the world, to thee I give

<BR>(For, given to me, I give to whom I please),

<BR>No trifle; yet with this reserve, not else--

<BR>On this condition, if thou wilt fall down,

<BR>And worship me as thy superior Lord

<BR>(Easily done), and hold them all of me;

<BR>For what can less so great a gift deserve?"

<BR>Whom thus our Saviour answered with disdain:--

<BR>"I never liked thy talk, thy offers less;

<BR>Now both abhor, since thou hast dared to utter

<BR>The abominable terms, impious condition.

<BR>But I endure the time, till which expired

<BR>Thou hast permission on me. It is written,

<BR>The first of all commandments, 'Thou shalt worship

<BR>The Lord thy God, and only Him shalt serve.'

<BR>And dar'st thou to the Son of God propound

<BR>To worship thee, accursed? now more accursed

<BR>For this attempt, bolder than that on Eve,

<BR>And more blasphemous; which expect to rue.

<BR>The kingdoms of the world to thee were given!

<BR>Permitted rather, and by thee usurped;

<BR>Other donation none thou canst produce.

<BR>If given, by whom but by the King of kings,

<BR>God over all supreme? If given to thee,

<BR>By thee how fairly is the Giver now

<BR>Repaid! But gratitude in thee is lost

<BR>Long since. Wert thou so void of fear or shame

<BR>As offer them to me, the Son of God--

<BR>To me my own, on such abhorred pact,

<BR>That I fall down and worship thee as God?

<BR>Get thee behind me! Plain thou now appear'st

<BR>That Evil One, Satan for ever damned."

<BR>To whom the Fiend, with fear abashed, replied:--

<BR>"Be not so sore offended, Son of God--

<BR>Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men--

<BR>If I, to try whether in higher sort

<BR>Than these thou bear'st that title, have proposed

<BR>What both from Men and Angels I receive,

<BR>Tetrarchs of Fire, Air, Flood, and on the Earth

<BR>Nations besides from all the quartered winds--

<BR>God of this World invoked, and World beneath.

<BR>Who then thou art, whose coming is foretold

<BR>To me most fatal, me it most concerns.

<BR>The trial hath indamaged thee no way,

<BR>Rather more honour left and more esteem;

<BR>Me naught advantaged, missing what I aimed.

<BR>Therefore let pass, as they are transitory,

<BR>The kingdoms of this world; I shall no more

<BR>Advise thee; gain them as thou canst, or not.

<BR>And thou thyself seem'st otherwise inclined

<BR>Than to a worldly crown, addicted more

<BR>To contemplation and profound dispute;

<BR>As by that early action may be judged,

<BR>When, slipping from thy mother's eye, thou went'st

<BR>Alone into the Temple, there wast found

<BR>Among the gravest Rabbies, disputant

<BR>On points and questions fitting Moses' chair,

<BR>Teaching, not taught. The childhood shews the man,

<BR>As morning shews the day. Be famous, then,

<BR>By wisdom; as thy empire must extend,

<BR>So let extend thy mind o'er all the world

<BR>In knowledge; all things in it comprehend.

<BR>All knowledge is not couched in Moses' law,

<BR>The Pentateuch, or what the Prophets wrote;

<BR>The Gentiles also know, and write, and teach

<BR>To admiration, led by Nature's light;

<BR>And with the Gentiles much thou must converse,

<BR>Ruling them by persuasion, as thou mean'st.

<BR>Without their learning, how wilt thou with them,

<BR>Or they with thee, hold conversation meet?

<BR>How wilt thou reason with them, how refute

<BR>Their idolisms, traditions, paradoxes?

<BR>Error by his own arms is best evinced.

<BR>Look once more, ere we leave this specular mount,

<BR>Westward, much nearer by south-west; behold

<BR>Where on the AEgean shore a city stands,

<BR>Built nobly, pure the air and light the soil--

<BR>Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts

<BR>And Eloquence, native to famous wits

<BR>Or hospitable, in her sweet recess,

<BR>City or suburban, studious walks and shades.

<BR>See there the olive-grove of Academe,

<BR>Plato's retirement, where the Attic bird

<BR>Trills her thick-warbled notes the summer long;

<BR>There, flowery hill, Hymettus, with the sound

<BR>Of bees' industrious murmur, oft invites

<BR>To studious musing; there Ilissus rowls

<BR>His whispering stream. Within the walls then view

<BR>The schools of ancient sages--his who bred

<BR>Great Alexander to subdue the world,

<BR>Lyceum there; and painted Stoa next.

<BR>There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power

<BR>Of harmony, in tones and numbers hit

<BR>By voice or hand, and various-measured verse,

<BR>AEolian charms and Dorian lyric odes,

<BR>And his who gave them breath, but higher sung,

<BR>Blind Melesigenes, thence Homer called,

<BR>Whose poem Phoebus challenged for his own.

<BR>Thence what the lofty grave Tragedians taught

<BR>In chorus or iambic, teachers best

<BR>Of moral prudence, with delight received

<BR>In brief sententious precepts, while they treat

<BR>Of fate, and chance, and change in human life,

<BR>High actions and high passions best describing.

<BR>Thence to the famous Orators repair,

<BR>Those ancient whose resistless eloquence

<BR>Wielded at will that fierce democraty,

<BR>Shook the Arsenal, and fulmined over Greece

<BR>To Macedon and Artaxerxes' throne.

<BR>To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear,

<BR>From heaven descended to the low-roofed house

<BR>Of Socrates--see there his tenement--

<BR>Whom, well inspired, the Oracle pronounced

<BR>Wisest of men; from whose mouth issued forth

<BR>Mellifluous streams, that watered all the schools

<BR>Of Academics old and new, with those

<BR>Surnamed Peripatetics, and the sect

<BR>Epicurean, and the Stoic severe.

<BR>These here revolve, or, as thou likest, at home,

<BR>Till time mature thee to a kingdom's weight;

<BR>These rules will render thee a king complete

<BR>Within thyself, much more with empire joined."

<BR>To whom our Saviour sagely thus replied:--

<BR>"Think not but that I know these things; or, think

<BR>I know them not, not therefore am I short

<BR>Of knowing what I ought. He who receives

<BR>Light from above, from the Fountain of Light,

<BR>No other doctrine needs, though granted true;

<BR>But these are false, or little else but dreams,

<BR>Conjectures, fancies, built on nothing firm.

<BR>The first and wisest of them all professed

<BR>To know this only, that he nothing knew;

<BR>The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits;

<BR>A third sort doubted all things, though plain sense;

<BR>Others in virtue placed felicity,

<BR>But virtue joined with riches and long life;

<BR>In corporal pleasure he, and careless ease;

<BR>The Stoic last in philosophic pride,

<BR>By him called virtue, and his virtuous man,

<BR>Wise, perfect in himself, and all possessing,

<BR>Equal to God, oft shames not to prefer,

<BR>As fearing God nor man, contemning all

<BR>Wealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and life--

<BR>Which, when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he can;

<BR>For all his tedious talk is but vain boast,

<BR>Or subtle shifts conviction to evade.

<BR>Alas! what can they teach, and not mislead,

<BR>Ignorant of themselves, of God much more,

<BR>And how the World began, and how Man fell,

<BR>Degraded by himself, on grace depending?

<BR>Much of the Soul they talk, but all awry;

<BR>And in themselves seek virtue; and to themselves

<BR>All glory arrogate, to God give none;

<BR>Rather accuse him under usual names,

<BR>Fortune and Fate, as one regardless quite

<BR>Of mortal things. Who, therefore, seeks in these

<BR>True wisdom finds her not, or, by delusion

<BR>Far worse, her false resemblance only meets,

<BR>An empty cloud. However, many books,

<BR>Wise men have said, are wearisome; who reads

<BR>Incessantly, and to his reading brings not

<BR>A spirit and judgment equal or superior,

<BR>(And what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek?)

<BR>Uncertain and unsettled still remains,

<BR>Deep-versed in books and shallow in himself,

<BR>Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys

<BR>And trifles for choice matters, worth a sponge,

<BR>As children gathering pebbles on the shore.

<BR>Or, if I would delight my private hours

<BR>With music or with poem, where so soon

<BR>As in our native language can I find

<BR>That solace? All our Law and Story strewed

<BR>With hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscribed,

<BR>Our Hebrew songs and harps, in Babylon

<BR>That pleased so well our victor's ear, declare

<BR>That rather Greece from us these arts derived--

<BR>Ill imitated while they loudest sing

<BR>The vices of their deities, and their own,

<BR>In fable, hymn, or song, so personating

<BR>Their gods ridiculous, and themselves past shame.

<BR>Remove their swelling epithetes, thick-laid

<BR>As varnish on a harlot's cheek, the rest,

<BR>Thin-sown with aught of profit or delight,

<BR>Will far be found unworthy to compare

<BR>With Sion's songs, to all true tastes excelling,

<BR>Where God is praised aright and godlike men,

<BR>The Holiest of Holies and his Saints

<BR>(Such are from God inspired, not such from thee);

<BR>Unless where moral virtue is expressed

<BR>By light of Nature, not in all quite lost.

<BR>Their orators thou then extoll'st as those

<BR>The top of eloquence--statists indeed,

<BR>And lovers of their country, as may seem;

<BR>But herein to our Prophets far beneath,

<BR>As men divinely taught, and better teaching

<BR>The solid rules of civil government,

<BR>In their majestic, unaffected style,

<BR>Than all the oratory of Greece and Rome.

<BR>In them is plainest taught, and easiest learnt,

<BR>What makes a nation happy, and keeps it so,

<BR>What ruins kingdoms, and lays cities flat;

<BR>These only, with our Law, best form a king."

<BR>So spake the Son of God; but Satan, now

<BR>Quite at a loss (for all his darts were spent),

<BR>Thus to our Saviour, with stern brow, replied:--

<BR>"Since neither wealth nor honour, arms nor arts,

<BR>Kingdom nor empire, pleases thee, nor aught

<BR>By me proposed in life contemplative

<BR>Or active, tended on by glory or fame,

<BR>What dost thou in this world? The Wilderness

<BR>For thee is fittest place: I found thee there,

<BR>And thither will return thee. Yet remember

<BR>What I foretell thee; soon thou shalt have cause

<BR>To wish thou never hadst rejected, thus

<BR>Nicely or cautiously, my offered aid,

<BR>Which would have set thee in short time with ease

<BR>On David's throne, or throne of all the world,

<BR>Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season,

<BR>When prophecies of thee are best fulfilled.

<BR>Now, contrary--if I read aught in heaven,

<BR>Or heaven write aught of fate--by what the stars

<BR>Voluminous, or single characters

<BR>In their conjunction met, give me to spell,

<BR>Sorrows and labours, opposition, hate,

<BR>Attends thee; scorns, reproaches, injuries,

<BR>Violence and stripes, and, lastly, cruel death.

<BR>A kingdom they portend thee, but what kingdom,

<BR>Real or allegoric, I discern not;

<BR>Nor when: eternal sure--as without end,

<BR>Without beginning; for no date prefixed

<BR>Directs me in the starry rubric set."

<BR>So saying, he took (for still he knew his power

<BR>Not yet expired), and to the Wilderness

<BR>Brought back, the Son of God, and left him there,

<BR>Feigning to disappear. Darkness now rose,

<BR>As daylight sunk, and brought in louring Night,

<BR>Her shadowy offspring, unsubstantial both,

<BR>Privation mere of light and absent day.

<BR>Our Saviour, meek, and with untroubled mind

<BR>After hisaerie jaunt, though hurried sore,

<BR>Hungry and cold, betook him to his rest,

<BR>Wherever, under some concourse of shades,

<BR>Whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield

<BR>From dews and damps of night his sheltered head;

<BR>But, sheltered, slept in vain; for at his head

<BR>The Tempter watched, and soon with ugly dreams

<BR>Disturbed his sleep. And either tropic now

<BR>'Gan thunder, and both ends of heaven; the clouds

<BR>From many a horrid rift abortive poured

<BR>Fierce rain with lightning mixed, water with fire,

<BR>In ruin reconciled; nor slept the winds

<BR>Within their stony caves, but rushed abroad

<BR>From the four hinges of the world, and fell

<BR>On the vexed wilderness, whose tallest pines,

<BR>Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest oaks,

<BR>Bowed their stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts,

<BR>Or torn up sheer. Ill wast thou shrouded then,

<BR>O patient Son of God, yet only stood'st

<BR>Unshaken! Nor yet staid the terror there:

<BR>Infernal ghosts and hellish furies round

<BR>Environed thee; some howled, some yelled, some shrieked,

<BR>Some bent at thee their fiery darts, while thou

<BR>Sat'st unappalled in calm and sinless peace.

<BR>Thus passed the night so foul, till Morning fair

<BR>Came forth with pilgrim steps, in amice grey,

<BR>Who with her radiant finger stilled the roar

<BR>Of thunder, chased the clouds, and laid the winds,

<BR>And griesly spectres, which the Fiend had raised

<BR>To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire.

<BR>And now the sun with more effectual beams

<BR>Had cheered the face of earth, and dried the wet

<BR>From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds,

<BR>Who all things now behold more fresh and green,

<BR>After a night of storm so ruinous,

<BR>Cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray,

<BR>To gratulate the sweet return of morn.

<BR>Nor yet, amidst this joy and brightest morn,

<BR>Was absent, after all his mischief done,

<BR>The Prince of Darkness; glad would also seem

<BR>Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came;

<BR>Yet with no new device (they all were spent),

<BR>Rather by this his last affront resolved,

<BR>Desperate of better course, to vent his rage

<BR>And mad despite to be so oft repelled.

<BR>Him walking on a sunny hill he found,

<BR>Backed on the north and west by a thick wood;

<BR>Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape,

<BR>And in a careless mood thus to him said:--

<BR>"Fair morning yet betides thee, Son of God,

<BR>After a dismal night. I heard the wrack,

<BR>As earth and sky would mingle; but myself

<BR>Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them,

<BR>As dangerous to the pillared frame of Heaven,

<BR>Or to the Earth's dark basis underneath,

<BR>Are to the main as inconsiderable

<BR>And harmless, if not wholesome, as a sneeze

<BR>To man's less universe, and soon are gone.

<BR>Yet, as being ofttimes noxious where they light

<BR>On man, beast, plant, wasteful and turbulent,

<BR>Like turbulencies in the affairs of men,

<BR>Over whose heads they roar, and seem to point,

<BR>They oft fore-signify and threaten ill.

<BR>This tempest at this desert most was bent;

<BR>Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell'st.

<BR>Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject

<BR>The perfect season offered with my aid

<BR>To win thy destined seat, but wilt prolong

<BR>All to the push of fate, pursue thy way

<BR>Of gaining David's throne no man knows when

<BR>(For both the when and how is nowhere told),

<BR>Thou shalt be what thou art ordained, no doubt;

<BR>For Angels have proclaimed it, but concealing

<BR>The time and means? Each act is rightliest done

<BR>Not when it must, but when it may be best.

<BR>If thou observe not this, be sure to find

<BR>What I foretold thee--many a hard assay

<BR>Of dangers, and adversities, and pains,

<BR>Ere thou of Israel's sceptre get fast hold;

<BR>Whereof this ominous night that closed thee round,

<BR>So many terrors, voices, prodigies,

<BR>May warn thee, as a sure foregoing sign."

<BR>So talked he, while the Son of God went on,

<BR>And staid not, but in brief him answered thus:--

<BR>"Me worse than wet thou find'st not; other harm

<BR>Those terrors which thou speak'st of did me none.

<BR>I never feared they could, though noising loud

<BR>And threatening nigh: what they can do as signs

<BR>Betokening or ill-boding I contemn

<BR>As false portents, not sent from God, but thee;

<BR>Who, knowing I shall reign past thy preventing,

<BR>Obtrud'st thy offered aid, that I, accepting,

<BR>At least might seem to hold all power of thee,

<BR>Ambitious Spirit! and would'st be thought my God;

<BR>And storm'st, refused, thinking to terrify

<BR>Me to thy will! Desist (thou art discerned,

<BR>And toil'st in vain), nor me in vain molest."

<BR>To whom the Fiend, now swoln with rage, replied:--

<BR>"Then hear, O Son of David, virgin-born!

<BR>For Son of God to me is yet in doubt.

<BR>Of the Messiah I have heard foretold

<BR>By all the Prophets; of thy birth, at length

<BR>Announced by Gabriel, with the first I knew,

<BR>And of the angelic song in Bethlehem field,

<BR>On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born.

<BR>From that time seldom have I ceased to eye

<BR>Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth,

<BR>Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred;

<BR>Till, at the ford of Jordan, whither all

<BR>Flocked to the Baptist, I among the rest

<BR>(Though not to be baptized), by voice from Heaven

<BR>Heard thee pronounced the Son of God beloved.

<BR>Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view

<BR>And narrower scrutiny, that I might learn

<BR>In what degree or meaning thou art called

<BR>The Son of God, which bears no single sense.

<BR>The Son of God I also am, or was;

<BR>And, if I was, I am; relation stands:

<BR>All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought

<BR>In some respect far higher so declared.

<BR>Therefore I watched thy footsteps from that hour,

<BR>And followed thee still on to this waste wild,

<BR>Where, by all best conjectures, I collect

<BR>Thou art to be my fatal enemy.

<BR>Good reason, then, if I beforehand seek

<BR>To understand my adversary, who

<BR>And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent;

<BR>By parle or composition, truce or league,

<BR>To win him, or win from him what I can.

<BR>And opportunity I here have had

<BR>To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee

<BR>Proof against all temptation, as a rock

<BR>Of adamant and as a centre, firm

<BR>To the utmost of mere man both wise and good,

<BR>Not more; for honours, riches, kingdoms, glory,

<BR>Have been before contemned, and may again.

<BR>Therefore, to know what more thou art than man,

<BR>Worth naming the Son of God by voice from Heaven,

<BR>Another method I must now begin."

<BR>So saying, he caught him up, and, without wing

<BR>Of hippogrif, bore through the air sublime,

<BR>Over the wilderness and o'er the plain,

<BR>Till underneath them fair Jerusalem,

<BR>The Holy City, lifted high her towers,

<BR>And higher yet the glorious Temple reared

<BR>Her pile, far off appearing like a mount

<BR>Of alablaster, topt with golden spires:

<BR>There, on the highest pinnacle, he set

<BR>The Son of God, and added thus in scorn:--

<BR>"There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright

<BR>Will ask thee skill. I to thy Father's house

<BR>Have brought thee, and highest placed: highest is best.

<BR>Now shew thy progeny; if not to stand,

<BR>Cast thyself down. Safely, if Son of God;

<BR>For it is written, 'He will give command

<BR>Concerning thee to his Angels; in their hands

<BR>They shall uplift thee, lest at any time

<BR>Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone.'"

<BR>To whom thus Jesus: "Also it is written,

<BR>'Tempt not the Lord thy God.'" He said, and stood;

<BR>But Satan, smitten with amazement, fell.

<BR>As when Earth's son, Antaeus (to compare

<BR>Small things with greatest), in Irassa strove

<BR>With Jove's Alcides, and, oft foiled, still rose,

<BR>Receiving from his mother Earth new strength,

<BR>Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joined,

<BR>Throttled at length in the air expired and fell,

<BR>So, after many a foil, the Tempter proud,

<BR>Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride

<BR>Fell whence he stood to see his victor fall;

<BR>And, as that Theban monster that proposed

<BR>Her riddle, and him who solved it not devoured,

<BR>That once found out and solved, for grief and spite

<BR>Cast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep,

<BR>So, strook with dread and anguish, fell the Fiend,

<BR>And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought

<BR>Joyless triumphals of his hoped success,

<BR>Ruin, and desperation, and dismay,

<BR>Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God.

<BR>So Satan fell; and straight a fiery globe

<BR>Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh,

<BR>Who on their plumy vans received Him soft

<BR>From his uneasy station, and upbore,

<BR>As on a floating couch, through the blithe air;

<BR>Then, in a flowery valley, set him down

<BR>On a green bank, and set before him spread

<BR>A table of celestial food, divine

<BR>Ambrosial fruits fetched from the Tree of Life,

<BR>And from the Fount of Life ambrosial drink,

<BR>That soon refreshed him wearied, and repaired

<BR>What hunger, if aught hunger, had impaired,

<BR>Or thirst; and, as he fed, Angelic quires

<BR>Sung heavenly anthems of his victory

<BR>Over temptation and the Tempter proud:--

<BR>"True Image of the Father, whether throned

<BR>In the bosom of bliss, and light of light

<BR>Conceiving, or, remote from Heaven, enshrined

<BR>In fleshly tabernacle and human form,

<BR>Wandering the wilderness--whatever place,

<BR>Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing

<BR>The Son of God, with Godlike force endued

<BR>Against the attempter of thy Father's throne

<BR>And thief of Paradise! Him long of old

<BR>Thou didst debel, and down from Heaven cast

<BR>With all his army; now thou hast avenged

<BR>Supplanted Adam, and, by vanquishing

<BR>Temptation, hast regained lost Paradise,

<BR>And frustrated the conquest fraudulent.

<BR>He never more henceforth will dare set foot

<BR>In paradise to tempt; his snares are broke.

<BR>For, though that seat of earthly bliss be failed,

<BR>A fairer Paradise is founded now

<BR>For Adam and his chosen sons, whom thou,

<BR>A Saviour, art come down to reinstall;

<BR>Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be,

<BR>Of tempter and temptation without fear.

<BR>But thou, Infernal Serpent! shalt not long

<BR>Rule in the clouds. Like an autumnal star,

<BR>Or lightning, thou shalt fall from Heaven, trod down

<BR>Under his feet. For proof, ere this thou feel'st

<BR>Thy wound (yet not thy last and deadliest wound)

<BR>By this repulse received, and hold'st in Hell

<BR>No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues

<BR>Thy bold attempt. Hereafter learn with awe

<BR>To dread the Son of God. He, all unarmed,

<BR>Shall chase thee, with the terror of his voice,

<BR>From thy demoniac holds, possession foul--

<BR>Thee and thy legions; yelling they shall fly,

<BR>And beg to hide them in a herd of swine,

<BR>Lest he command them down into the Deep,

<BR>Bound, and to torment sent before their time.

<BR>Hail, Son of the Most High, heir of both Worlds,

<BR>Queller of Satan! On thy glorious work

<BR>Now enter, and begin to save Mankind."

<BR>Thus they the Son of God, our Saviour meek,

<BR>Sung victor, and, from heavenly feast refreshed,

<BR>Brought on his way with joy. He, unobserved,

<BR>Home to his mother's house private returned.

Book 2</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>MEANWHILE the new-baptized, who yet remained

<BR>At Jordan with the Baptist, and had seen

<BR>Him whom they heard so late expressly called

<BR>Jesus Messiah, Son of God, declared,

<BR>And on that high authority had believed,

<BR>And with him talked, and with him lodged--I mean

<BR>Andrew and Simon, famous after known,

<BR>With others, though in Holy Writ not named--

<BR>Now missing him, their joy so lately found,

<BR>So lately found and so abruptly gone,

<BR>Began to doubt, and doubted many days,

<BR>And, as the days increased, increased their doubt.

<BR>Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn,

<BR>And for a time caught up to God, as once

<BR>Moses was in the Mount and missing long,

<BR>And the great Thisbite, who on fiery wheels

<BR>Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come.

<BR>Therefore, as those young prophets then with care

<BR>Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these

<BR>Nigh to Bethabara--in Jericho

<BR>The city of palms, AEnon, and Salem old,

<BR>Machaerus, and each town or city walled

<BR>On this side the broad lake Genezaret,

<BR>Or in Peraea--but returned in vain.

<BR>Then on the bank of Jordan, by a creek,

<BR>Where winds with reeds and osiers whispering play,

<BR>Plain fishermen (no greater men them call),

<BR>Close in a cottage low together got,

<BR>Their unexpected loss and plaints outbreathed:--

<BR>"Alas, from what high hope to what relapse

<BR>Unlooked for are we fallen! Our eyes beheld

<BR>Messiah certainly now come, so long

<BR>Expected of our fathers; we have heard

<BR>His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth.

<BR>'Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand;

<BR>The kingdom shall to Israel be restored:'

<BR>Thus we rejoiced, but soon our joy is turned

<BR>Into perplexity and new amaze.

<BR>For whither is he gone? what accident

<BR>Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire

<BR>After appearance, and again prolong

<BR>Our expectation? God of Israel,

<BR>Send thy Messiah forth; the time is come.

<BR>Behold the kings of the earth, how they oppress

<BR>Thy Chosen, to what highth their power unjust

<BR>They have exalted, and behind them cast

<BR>All fear of Thee; arise, and vindicate

<BR>Thy glory; free thy people from their yoke!

<BR>But let us wait; thus far He hath performed--

<BR>Sent his Anointed, and to us revealed him

<BR>By his great Prophet pointed at and shown

<BR>In public, and with him we have conversed.

<BR>Let us be glad of this, and all our fears

<BR>Lay on his providence; He will not fail,

<BR>Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall--

<BR>Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence:

<BR>Soon we shall see our hope, our joy, return."

<BR>Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume

<BR>To find whom at the first they found unsought.

<BR>But to his mother Mary, when she saw

<BR>Others returned from baptism, not her Son,

<BR>Nor left at Jordan tidings of him none,

<BR>Within her breast though calm, her breast though pure,

<BR>Motherly cares and fears got head, and raised

<BR>Some troubled thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad:--

<BR>"Oh, what avails me now that honour high,

<BR>To have conceived of God, or that salute,

<BR>'Hail, highly favoured, among women blest!'

<BR>While I to sorrows am no less advanced,

<BR>And fears as eminent above the lot

<BR>Of other women, by the birth I bore:

<BR>In such a season born, when scarce a shed

<BR>Could be obtained to shelter him or me

<BR>From the bleak air? A stable was our warmth,

<BR>A manger his; yet soon enforced to fly

<BR>Thence into Egypt, till the murderous king

<BR>Were dead, who sought his life, and, missing, filled

<BR>With infant blood the streets of Bethlehem.

<BR>From Egypt home returned, in Nazareth

<BR>Hath been our dwelling many years; his life

<BR>Private, unactive, calm, contemplative,

<BR>Little suspicious to any king. But now,

<BR>Full grown to man, acknowledged, as I hear,

<BR>By John the Baptist, and in public shewn,

<BR>Son owned from Heaven by his Father's voice,

<BR>I looked for some great change. To honour? no;

<BR>But trouble, as old Simeon plain foretold,

<BR>That to the fall and rising he should be

<BR>Of many in Israel, and to a sign

<BR>Spoken against--that through my very soul

<BR>A sword shall pierce. This is my favoured lot,

<BR>My exaltation to afflictions high!

<BR>Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest!

<BR>I will not argue that, nor will repine.

<BR>But where delays he now? Some great intent

<BR>Conceals him. When twelve years he scarce had seen,

<BR>I lost him, but so found as well I saw

<BR>He could not lose himself, but went about

<BR>His Father's business. What he meant I mused--

<BR>Since understand; much more his absence now

<BR>Thus long to some great purpose he obscures.

<BR>But I to wait with patience am inured;

<BR>My heart hath been a storehouse long of things

<BR>And sayings laid up, pretending strange events."

<BR>Thus Mary, pondering oft, and oft to mind

<BR>Recalling what remarkably had passed

<BR>Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts

<BR>Meekly composed awaited the fulfilling:

<BR>The while her Son, tracing the desert wild,

<BR>Sole, but with holiest meditations fed,

<BR>Into himself descended, and at once

<BR>All his great work to come before him set--

<BR>How to begin, how to accomplish best

<BR>His end of being on Earth, and mission high.

<BR>For Satan, with sly preface to return,

<BR>Had left him vacant, and with speed was gone

<BR>Up to the middle region of thick air,

<BR>Where all his Potentates in council sate.

<BR>There, without sign of boast, or sign of joy,

<BR>Solicitous and blank, he thus began:--

<BR>"Princes, Heaven's ancient Sons, AEthereal Thrones--

<BR>Daemonian Spirits now, from the element

<BR>Each of his reign allotted, rightlier called

<BR>Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath

<BR>(So may we hold our place and these mild seats

<BR>Without new trouble!)--such an enemy

<BR>Is risen to invade us, who no less

<BR>Threatens than our expulsion down to Hell.

<BR>I, as I undertook, and with the vote

<BR>Consenting in full frequence was impowered,

<BR>Have found him, viewed him, tasted him; but find

<BR>Far other labour to be undergone

<BR>Than when I dealt with Adam, first of men,

<BR>Though Adam by his wife's allurement fell,

<BR>However to this Man inferior far--

<BR>If he be Man by mother's side, at least

<BR>With more than human gifts from Heaven adorned,

<BR>Perfections absolute, graces divine,

<BR>And amplitude of mind to greatest deeds.

<BR>Therefore I am returned, lest confidence

<BR>Of my success with Eve in Paradise

<BR>Deceive ye to persuasion over-sure

<BR>Of like succeeding here. I summon all

<BR>Rather to be in readiness with hand

<BR>Or counsel to assist, lest I, who erst

<BR>Thought none my equal, now be overmatched."

<BR>So spake the old Serpent, doubting, and from all

<BR>With clamour was assured their utmost aid

<BR>At his command; when from amidst them rose

<BR>Belial, the dissolutest Spirit that fell,

<BR>The sensualest, and, after Asmodai,

<BR>The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advised:--

<BR>"Set women in his eye and in his walk,

<BR>Among daughters of men the fairest found.

<BR>Many are in each region passing fair

<BR>As the noon sky, more like to goddesses

<BR>Than mortal creatures, graceful and discreet,

<BR>Expert in amorous arts, enchanting tongues

<BR>Persuasive, virgin majesty with mild

<BR>And sweet allayed, yet terrible to approach,

<BR>Skilled to retire, and in retiring draw

<BR>Hearts after them tangled in amorous nets.

<BR>Such object hath the power to soften and tame

<BR>Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow,

<BR>Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve,

<BR>Draw out with credulous desire, and lead

<BR>At will the manliest, resolutest breast,

<BR>As the magnetic hardest iron draws.

<BR>Women, when nothing else, beguiled the heart

<BR>Of wisest Solomon, and made him build,

<BR>And made him bow, to the gods of his wives."

<BR>To whom quick answer Satan thus returned:--

<BR>"Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st

<BR>All others by thyself. Because of old

<BR>Thou thyself doat'st on womankind, admiring

<BR>Their shape, their colour, and attractive grace,

<BR>None are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys.

<BR>Before the Flood, thou, with thy lusty crew,

<BR>False titled Sons of God, roaming the Earth,

<BR>Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men,

<BR>And coupled with them, and begot a race.

<BR>Have we not seen, or by relation heard,

<BR>In courts and regal chambers how thou lurk'st,

<BR>In wood or grove, by mossy fountain-side,

<BR>In valley or green meadow, to waylay

<BR>Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene,

<BR>Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa,

<BR>Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more

<BR>Too long--then lay'st thy scapes on names adored,

<BR>Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan,

<BR>Satyr, or Faun, or Silvan? But these haunts

<BR>Delight not all. Among the sons of men

<BR>How many have with a smile made small account

<BR>Of beauty and her lures, easily scorned

<BR>All her assaults, on worthier things intent!

<BR>Remember that Pellean conqueror,

<BR>A youth, how all the beauties of the East

<BR>He slightly viewed, and slightly overpassed;

<BR>How he surnamed of Africa dismissed,

<BR>In his prime youth, the fair Iberian maid.

<BR>For Solomon, he lived at ease, and, full

<BR>Of honour, wealth, high fare, aimed not beyond

<BR>Higher design than to enjoy his state;

<BR>Thence to the bait of women lay exposed.

<BR>But he whom we attempt is wiser far

<BR>Than Solomon, of more exalted mind,

<BR>Made and set wholly on the accomplishment

<BR>Of greatest things. What woman will you find,

<BR>Though of this age the wonder and the fame,

<BR>On whom his leisure will voutsafe an eye

<BR>Of fond desire? Or should she, confident,

<BR>As sitting queen adored on Beauty's throne,

<BR>Descend with all her winning charms begirt

<BR>To enamour, as the zone of Venus once

<BR>Wrought that effect on Jove (so fables tell),

<BR>How would one look from his majestic brow,

<BR>Seated as on the top of Virtue's hill,

<BR>Discountenance her despised, and put to rout

<BR>All her array, her female pride deject,

<BR>Or turn to reverent awe! For Beauty stands

<BR>In the admiration only of weak minds

<BR>Led captive; cease to admire, and all her plumes

<BR>Fall flat, and shrink into a trivial toy,

<BR>At every sudden slighting quite abashed.

<BR>Therefore with manlier objects we must try

<BR>His constancy--with such as have more shew

<BR>Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise

<BR>(Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wrecked);

<BR>Or that which only seems to satisfy

<BR>Lawful desires of nature, not beyond.

<BR>And now I know he hungers, where no food

<BR>Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness:

<BR>The rest commit to me; I shall let pass

<BR>No advantage, and his strength as oft assay."

<BR>He ceased, and heard their grant in loud acclaim;

<BR>Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band

<BR>Of Spirits likest to himself in guile,

<BR>To be at hand and at his beck appear,

<BR>If cause were to unfold some active scene

<BR>Of various persons, each to know his part;

<BR>Then to the desert takes with these his flight,

<BR>Where still, from shade to shade, the Son of God,

<BR>After forty days' fasting, had remained,

<BR>Now hungering first, and to himself thus said:--

<BR>"Where will this end? Four times ten days I have passed

<BR>Wandering this woody maze, and human food

<BR>Nor tasted, nor had appetite. That fast

<BR>To virtue I impute not, or count part

<BR>Of what I suffer here. If nature need not,

<BR>Or God support nature without repast,

<BR>Though needing, what praise is it to endure?

<BR>But now I feel I hunger; which declares

<BR>Nature hath need of what she asks. Yet God

<BR>Can satisfy that need some other way,

<BR>Though hunger still remain. So it remain

<BR>Without this body's wasting, I content me,

<BR>And from the sting of famine fear no harm;

<BR>Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts, that feed

<BR>Me hungering more to do my Father's will."

<BR>It was the hour of night, when thus the Son

<BR>Communed in silent walk, then laid him down

<BR>Under the hospitable covert nigh

<BR>Of trees thick interwoven. There he slept,

<BR>And dreamed, as appetite is wont to dream,

<BR>Of meats and drinks, nature's refreshment sweet.

<BR>Him thought he by the brook of Cherith stood,

<BR>And saw the ravens with their horny beaks

<BR>Food to Elijah bringing even and morn--

<BR>Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought;

<BR>He saw the Prophet also, how he fled

<BR>Into the desert, and how there he slept

<BR>Under a juniper--then how, awaked,

<BR>He found his supper on the coals prepared,

<BR>And by the Angel was bid rise and eat,

<BR>And eat the second time after repose,

<BR>The strength whereof sufficed him forty days:

<BR>Sometimes that with Elijah he partook,

<BR>Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse.

<BR>Thus wore out night; and now the harald Lark

<BR>Left his ground-nest, high towering to descry

<BR>The Morn's approach, and greet her with his song.

<BR>As lightly from his grassy couch up rose

<BR>Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream;

<BR>Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting waked.

<BR>Up to a hill anon his steps he reared,

<BR>From whose high top to ken the prospect round,

<BR>If cottage were in view, sheep-cote, or herd;

<BR>But cottage, herd, or sheep-cote, none he saw--

<BR>Only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove,

<BR>With chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud.

<BR>Thither he bent his way, determined there

<BR>To rest at noon, and entered soon the shade

<BR>High-roofed, and walks beneath, and alleys brown,

<BR>That opened in the midst a woody scene;

<BR>Nature's own work it seemed (Nature taught Art),

<BR>And, to a superstitious eye, the haunt

<BR>Of wood-gods and wood-nymphs. He viewed it round;

<BR>When suddenly a man before him stood,

<BR>Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad,

<BR>As one in city or court or palace bred,

<BR>And with fair speech these words to him addressed:--

<BR>"With granted leave officious I return,

<BR>But much more wonder that the Son of God

<BR>In this wild solitude so long should bide,

<BR>Of all things destitute, and, well I know,

<BR>Not without hunger. Others of some note,

<BR>As story tells, have trod this wilderness:

<BR>The fugitive Bond-woman, with her son,

<BR>Outcast Nebaioth, yet found here relief

<BR>By a providing Angel; all the race

<BR>Of Israel here had famished, had not God

<BR>Rained from heaven manna; and that Prophet bold,

<BR>Native of Thebez, wandering here, was fed

<BR>Twice by a voice inviting him to eat.

<BR>Of thee those forty days none hath regard,

<BR>Forty and more deserted here indeed."

<BR>To whom thus Jesus:--"What conclud'st thou hence?

<BR>They all had need; I, as thou seest, have none."

<BR>"How hast thou hunger then?" Satan replied.

<BR>"Tell me, if food were now before thee set,

<BR>Wouldst thou not eat?" "Thereafter as I like

<BR>the giver," answered Jesus. "Why should that

<BR>Cause thy refusal?" said the subtle Fiend.

<BR>"Hast thou not right to all created things?

<BR>Owe not all creatures, by just right, to thee

<BR>Duty and service, nor to stay till bid,

<BR>But tender all their power? Nor mention I

<BR>Meats by the law unclean, or offered first

<BR>To idols--those young Daniel could refuse;

<BR>Nor proffered by an enemy--though who

<BR>Would scruple that, with want oppressed? Behold,

<BR>Nature ashamed, or, better to express,

<BR>Troubled, that thou shouldst hunger, hath purveyed

<BR>From all the elements her choicest store,

<BR>To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord

<BR>With honour. Only deign to sit and eat."

<BR>He spake no dream; for, as his words had end,

<BR>Our Saviour, lifting up his eyes, beheld,

<BR>In ample space under the broadest shade,

<BR>A table richly spread in regal mode,

<BR>With dishes piled and meats of noblest sort

<BR>And savour--beasts of chase, or fowl of game,

<BR>In pastry built, or from the spit, or boiled,

<BR>Grisamber-steamed; all fish, from sea or shore,

<BR>Freshet or purling brook, of shell or fin,

<BR>And exquisitest name, for which was drained

<BR>Pontus, and Lucrine bay, and Afric coast.

<BR>Alas! how simple, to these cates compared,

<BR>Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve!

<BR>And at a stately sideboard, by the wine,

<BR>That fragrant smell diffused, in order stood

<BR>Tall stripling youths rich-clad, of fairer hue

<BR>Than Ganymed or Hylas; distant more,

<BR>Under the trees now tripped, now solemn stood,

<BR>Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades

<BR>With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn,

<BR>And ladies of the Hesperides, that seemed

<BR>Fairer than feigned of old, or fabled since

<BR>Of faery damsels met in forest wide

<BR>By knights of Logres, or of Lyones,

<BR>Lancelot, or Pelleas, or Pellenore.

<BR>And all the while harmonious airs were heard

<BR>Of chiming strings or charming pipes; and winds

<BR>Of gentlest gale Arabian odours fanned

<BR>From their soft wings, and Flora's earliest smells.

<BR>Such was the splendour; and the Tempter now

<BR>His invitation earnestly renewed:--

<BR>"What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat?

<BR>These are not fruits forbidden; no interdict

<BR>Defends the touching of these viands pure;

<BR>Their taste no knowledge works, at least of evil,

<BR>But life preserves, destroys life's enemy,

<BR>Hunger, with sweet restorative delight.

<BR>All these are Spirits of air, and woods, and springs,

<BR>Thy gentle ministers, who come to pay

<BR>Thee homage, and acknowledge thee their Lord.

<BR>What doubt'st thou, Son of God? Sit down and eat."

<BR>To whom thus Jesus temperately replied:--

<BR>"Said'st thou not that to all things I had right?

<BR>And who withholds my power that right to use?

<BR>Shall I receive by gift what of my own,

<BR>When and where likes me best, I can command?

<BR>I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou,

<BR>Command a table in this wilderness,

<BR>And call swift flights of Angels ministrant,

<BR>Arrayed in glory, on my cup to attend:

<BR>Why shouldst thou, then, obtrude this diligence

<BR>In vain, where no acceptance it can find?

<BR>And with my hunger what hast thou to do?

<BR>Thy pompous delicacies I contemn,

<BR>And count thy specious gifts no gifts, but guiles."

<BR>To whom thus answered Satan, male-content:--

<BR>"That I have also power to give thou seest;

<BR>If of that power I bring thee voluntary

<BR>What I might have bestowed on whom I pleased,

<BR>And rather opportunely in this place

<BR>Chose to impart to thy apparent need,

<BR>Why shouldst thou not accept it? But I see

<BR>What I can do or offer is suspect.

<BR>Of these things others quickly will dispose,

<BR>Whose pains have earned the far-fet spoil." With that

<BR>Both table and provision vanished quite,

<BR>With sound of harpies' wings and talons heard;

<BR>Only the importune Tempter still remained,

<BR>And with these words his temptation pursued:--

<BR>"By hunger, that each other creature tames,

<BR>Thou art not to be harmed, therefore not moved;

<BR>Thy temperance, invincible besides,

<BR>For no allurement yields to appetite;

<BR>And all thy heart is set on high designs,

<BR>High actions. But wherewith to be achieved?

<BR>Great acts require great means of enterprise;

<BR>Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth,

<BR>A carpenter thy father known, thyself

<BR>Bred up in poverty and straits at home,

<BR>Lost in a desert here and hunger-bit.

<BR>Which way, or from what hope, dost thou aspire

<BR>To greatness? whence authority deriv'st?

<BR>What followers, what retinue canst thou gain,

<BR>Or at thy heels the dizzy multitude,

<BR>Longer than thou canst feed them on thy cost?

<BR>Money brings honour, friends, conquest, and realms.

<BR>What raised Antipater the Edomite,

<BR>And his son Herod placed on Juda's throne,

<BR>Thy throne, but gold, that got him puissant friends?

<BR>Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive,

<BR>Get riches first, get wealth, and treasure heap--

<BR>Not difficult, if thou hearken to me.

<BR>Riches are mine, fortune is in my hand;

<BR>They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain,

<BR>While virtue, valour, wisdom, sit in want."

<BR>To whom thus Jesus patiently replied:--

<BR>"Yet wealth without these three is impotent

<BR>To gain dominion, or to keep it gained--

<BR>Witness those ancient empires of the earth,

<BR>In highth of all their flowing wealth dissolved;

<BR>But men endued with these have oft attained,

<BR>In lowest poverty, to highest deeds--

<BR>Gideon, and Jephtha, and the shepherd lad

<BR>Whose offspring on the throne of Juda sate

<BR>So many ages, and shall yet regain

<BR>That seat, and reign in Israel without end.

<BR>Among the Heathen (for throughout the world

<BR>To me is not unknown what hath been done

<BR>Worthy of memorial) canst thou not remember

<BR>Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus?

<BR>For I esteem those names of men so poor,

<BR>Who could do mighty things, and could contemn

<BR>Riches, though offered from the hand of kings.

<BR>And what in me seems wanting but that I

<BR>May also in this poverty as soon

<BR>Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more?

<BR>Extol not riches, then, the toil of fools,

<BR>The wise man's cumbrance, if not snare; more apt

<BR>To slacken virtue and abate her edge

<BR>Than prompt her to do aught may merit praise.

<BR>What if with like aversion I reject

<BR>Riches and realms! Yet not for that a crown,

<BR>Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns,

<BR>Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights,

<BR>To him who wears the regal diadem,

<BR>When on his shoulders each man's burden lies;

<BR>For therein stands the office of a king,

<BR>His honour, virtue, merit, and chief praise,

<BR>That for the public all this weight he bears.

<BR>Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules

<BR>Passions, desires, and fears, is more a king--

<BR>Which every wise and virtuous man attains;

<BR>And who attains not, ill aspires to rule

<BR>Cities of men, or headstrong multitudes,

<BR>Subject himself to anarchy within,

<BR>Or lawless passions in him, which he serves.

<BR>But to guide nations in the way of truth

<BR>By saving doctrine, and from error lead

<BR>To know, and, knowing, worship God aright,

<BR>Is yet more kingly. This attracts the soul,

<BR>Governs the inner man, the nobler part;

<BR>That other o'er the body only reigns,

<BR>And oft by force--which to a generous mind

<BR>So reigning can be no sincere delight.

<BR>Besides, to give a kingdom hath been thought

<BR>Greater and nobler done, and to lay down

<BR>Far more magnanimous, than to assume.

<BR>Riches are needless, then, both for themselves,

<BR>And for thy reason why they should be sought--

<BR>To gain a sceptre, oftest better missed."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>SO spake the Son of God; and Satan stood

<BR>A while as mute, confounded what to say,

<BR>What to reply, confuted and convinced

<BR>Of his weak arguing and fallacious drift;

<BR>At length, collecting all his serpent wiles,

<BR>With soothing words renewed, him thus accosts:--

<BR>"I see thou know'st what is of use to know,

<BR>What best to say canst say, to do canst do;

<BR>Thy actions to thy words accord; thy words

<BR>To thy large heart give utterance due; thy heart

<BR>Contains of good, wise, just, the perfet shape.

<BR>Should kings and nations from thy mouth consult,

<BR>Thy counsel would be as the oracle

<BR>Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems

<BR>On Aaron's breast, or tongue of Seers old

<BR>Infallible; or, wert thou sought to deeds

<BR>That might require the array of war, thy skill

<BR>Of conduct would be such that all the world

<BR>Could not sustain thy prowess, or subsist

<BR>In battle, though against thy few in arms.

<BR>These godlike virtues wherefore dost thou hide?

<BR>Affecting private life, or more obscure

<BR>In savage wilderness, wherefore deprive

<BR>All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thyself

<BR>The fame and glory--glory, the reward

<BR>That sole excites to high attempts the flame

<BR>Of most erected spirits, most tempered pure

<BR>AEthereal, who all pleasures else despise,

<BR>All treasures and all gain esteem as dross,

<BR>And dignities and powers, all but the highest?

<BR>Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe. The son

<BR>Of Macedonian Philip had ere these

<BR>Won Asia, and the throne of Cyrus held

<BR>At his dispose; young Scipio had brought down

<BR>The Carthaginian pride; young Pompey quelled

<BR>The Pontic king, and in triumph had rode.

<BR>Yet years, and to ripe years judgment mature,

<BR>Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment.

<BR>Great Julius, whom now all the world admires,

<BR>The more he grew in years, the more inflamed

<BR>With glory, wept that he had lived so long

<BR>Ingloroious. But thou yet art not too late."

<BR>To whom our Saviour calmly thus replied:--

<BR>"Thou neither dost persuade me to seek wealth

<BR>For empire's sake, nor empire to affect

<BR>For glory's sake, by all thy argument.

<BR>For what is glory but the blaze of fame,

<BR>The people's praise, if always praise unmixed?

<BR>And what the people but a herd confused,

<BR>A miscellaneous rabble, who extol

<BR>Things vulgar, and, well weighed, scarce worth the praise?

<BR>They praise and they admire they know not what,

<BR>And know not whom, but as one leads the other;

<BR>And what delight to be by such extolled,

<BR>To live upon their tongues, and be their talk?

<BR>Of whom to be dispraised were no small praise--

<BR>His lot who dares be singularly good.

<BR>The intelligent among them and the wise

<BR>Are few, and glory scarce of few is raised.

<BR>This is true glory and renown--when God,

<BR>Looking on the Earth, with approbation marks

<BR>The just man, and divulges him through Heaven

<BR>To all his Angels, who with true applause

<BR>Recount his praises. Thus he did to Job,

<BR>When, to extend his fame through Heaven and Earth,

<BR>As thou to thy reproach may'st well remember,

<BR>He asked thee, 'Hast thou seen my servant Job?'

<BR>Famous he was in Heaven; on Earth less known,

<BR>Where glory is false glory, attributed

<BR>To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame.

<BR>They err who count it glorious to subdue

<BR>By conquest far and wide, to overrun

<BR>Large countries, and in field great battles win,

<BR>Great cities by assault. What do these worthies

<BR>But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave

<BR>Peaceable nations, neighbouring or remote,

<BR>Made captive, yet deserving freedom more

<BR>Than those their conquerors, who leave behind

<BR>Nothing but ruin wheresoe'er they rove,

<BR>And all the flourishing works of peace destroy;

<BR>Then swell with pride, and must be titled Gods,

<BR>Great benefactors of mankind, Deliverers,

<BR>Worshipped with temple, priest, and sacrifice?

<BR>One is the son of Jove, of Mars the other;

<BR>Till conqueror Death discover them scarce men,

<BR>Rowling in brutish vices, and deformed,

<BR>Violent or shameful death their due reward.

<BR>But, if there be in glory aught of good;

<BR>It may be means far different be attained,

<BR>Without ambition, war, or violence--

<BR>By deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent,

<BR>By patience, temperance. I mention still

<BR>Him whom thy wrongs, with saintly patience borne,

<BR>Made famous in a land and times obscure;

<BR>Who names not now with honour patient Job?

<BR>Poor Socrates, (who next more memorable?)

<BR>By what he taught and suffered for so doing,

<BR>For truth's sake suffering death unjust, lives now

<BR>Equal in fame to proudest conquerors.

<BR>Yet, if for fame and glory aught be done,

<BR>Aught suffered--if young African for fame

<BR>His wasted country freed from Punic rage--

<BR>The deed becomes unpraised, the man at least,

<BR>And loses, though but verbal, his reward.

<BR>Shall I seek glory, then, as vain men seek,

<BR>Oft not deserved? I seek not mine, but His

<BR>Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am."

<BR>To whom the Tempter, murmuring, thus replied:--

<BR>"Think not so slight of glory, therein least

<BR>Resembling thy great Father. He seeks glory,

<BR>And for his glory all things made, all things

<BR>Orders and governs; nor content in Heaven,

<BR>By all his Angels glorified, requires

<BR>Glory from men, from all men, good or bad,

<BR>Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption.

<BR>Above all sacrifice, or hallowed gift,

<BR>Glory he requires, and glory he receives,

<BR>Promiscuous from all nations, Jew, or Greek,

<BR>Or Barbarous, nor exception hath declared;

<BR>From us, his foes pronounced, glory he exacts."

<BR>To whom our Saviour fervently replied:

<BR>"And reason; since his Word all things produced,

<BR>Though chiefly not for glory as prime end,

<BR>But to shew forth his goodness, and impart

<BR>His good communicable to every soul

<BR>Freely; of whom what could He less expect

<BR>Than glory and benediction--that is, thanks--

<BR>The slightest, easiest, readiest recompense

<BR>From them who could return him nothing else,

<BR>And, not returning that, would likeliest render

<BR>Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy?

<BR>Hard recompense, unsuitable return

<BR>For so much good, so much beneficience!

<BR>But why should man seek glory, who of his own

<BR>Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs

<BR>But condemnation, ignominy, and shame--

<BR>Who, for so many benefits received,

<BR>Turned recreant to God, ingrate and false,

<BR>And so of all true good himself despoiled;

<BR>Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take

<BR>That which to God alone of right belongs?

<BR>Yet so much bounty is in God, such grace,

<BR>That who advances his glory, not their own,

<BR>Them he himself to glory will advance."

<BR>So spake the Son of God; and here again

<BR>Satan had not to answer, but stood struck

<BR>With guilt of his own sin--for he himself,

<BR>Insatiable of glory, had lost all;

<BR>Yet of another plea bethought him soon:--

<BR>"Of glory, as thou wilt," said he, "so deem;

<BR>Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass.

<BR>But to a Kingdom thou art born--ordained

<BR>To sit upon thy father David's throne,

<BR>By mother's side thy father, though thy right

<BR>Be now in powerful hands, that will not part

<BR>Easily from possession won with arms.

<BR>Judaea now and all the Promised Land,

<BR>Reduced a province under Roman yoke,

<BR>Obeys Tiberius, nor is always ruled

<BR>With temperate sway: oft have they violated

<BR>The Temple, oft the Law, with foul affronts,

<BR>Abominations rather, as did once

<BR>Antiochus. And think'st thou to regain

<BR>Thy right by sitting still, or thus retiring?

<BR>So did not Machabeus. He indeed

<BR>Retired unto the Desert, but with arms;

<BR>And o'er a mighty king so oft prevailed

<BR>That by strong hand his family obtained,

<BR>Though priests, the crown, and David's throne usurped,

<BR>With Modin and her suburbs once content.

<BR>If kingdom move thee not, let move thee zeal

<BR>And duty--zeal and duty are not slow,

<BR>But on Occasion's forelock watchful wait:

<BR>They themselves rather are occasion best--

<BR>Zeal of thy Father's house, duty to free

<BR>Thy country from her heathen servitude.

<BR>So shalt thou best fulfil, best verify,

<BR>The Prophets old, who sung thy endless reign--

<BR>The happier reign the sooner it begins.

<BR>Rein then; what canst thou better do the while?"

<BR>To whom our Saviour answer thus returned:--

<BR>"All things are best fulfilled in their due time;

<BR>And time there is for all things, Truth hath said.

<BR>If of my reign Prophetic Writ hath told

<BR>That it shall never end, so, when begin

<BR>The Father in his purpose hath decreed--

<BR>He in whose hand all times and seasons rowl.

<BR>What if he hath decreed that I shall first

<BR>Be tried in humble state, and things adverse,

<BR>By tribulations, injuries, insults,

<BR>Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence,

<BR>Suffering, abstaining, quietly expecting

<BR>Without distrust or doubt, that He may know

<BR>What I can suffer, how obey? Who best

<BR>Can suffer best can do, best reign who first

<BR>Well hath obeyed--just trial ere I merit

<BR>My exaltation without change or end.

<BR>But what concerns it thee when I begin

<BR>My everlasting Kingdom? Why art thou

<BR>Solicitous? What moves thy inquisition?

<BR>Know'st thou not that my rising is thy fall,

<BR>And my promotion will be thy destruction?"

<BR>To whom the Tempter, inly racked, replied:--

<BR>"Let that come when it comes. All hope is lost

<BR>Of my reception into grace; what worse?

<BR>For where no hope is left is left no fear.

<BR>If there be worse, the expectation more

<BR>Of worse torments me than the feeling can.

<BR>I would be at the worst; worst is my port,

<BR>My harbour, and my ultimate repose,

<BR>The end I would attain, my final good.

<BR>My error was my error, and my crime

<BR>My crime; whatever, for itself condemned,

<BR>And will alike be punished, whether thou

<BR>Reign or reign not--though to that gentle brow

<BR>Willingly I could fly, and hope thy reign,

<BR>From that placid aspect and meek regard,

<BR>Rather than aggravate my evil state,

<BR>Would stand between me and thy Father's ire

<BR>(Whose ire I dread more than the fire of Hell)

<BR>A shelter and a kind of shading cool

<BR>Interposition, as a summer's cloud.

<BR>If I, then, to the worst that can be haste,

<BR>Why move thy feet so slow to what is best?

<BR>Happiest, both to thyself and all the world,

<BR>That thou, who worthiest art, shouldst be their King!

<BR>Perhaps thou linger'st in deep thoughts detained

<BR>Of the enterprise so hazardous and high!

<BR>No wonder; for, though in thee be united

<BR>What of perfection can in Man be found,

<BR>Or human nature can receive, consider

<BR>Thy life hath yet been private, most part spent

<BR>At home, scarce viewed the Galilean towns,

<BR>And once a year Jerusalem, few days'

<BR>Short sojourn; and what thence couldst thou observe?

<BR>The world thou hast not seen, much less her glory,

<BR>Empires, and monarchs, and their radiant courts--

<BR>Best school of best experience, quickest in sight

<BR>In all things that to greatest actions lead.

<BR>The wisest, unexperienced, will be ever

<BR>Timorous, and loth, with novice modesty

<BR>(As he who, seeking asses, found a kingdom)

<BR>Irresolute, unhardy, unadventrous.

<BR>But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit

<BR>Those rudiments, and see before thine eyes

<BR>The monarchies of the Earth, their pomp and state--

<BR>Sufficient introduction to inform

<BR>Thee, of thyself so apt, in regal arts,

<BR>And regal mysteries; that thou may'st know

<BR>How best their opposition to withstand."

<BR>With that (such power was given him then), he took

<BR>The Son of God up to a mountain high.

<BR>It was a mountain at whose verdant feet

<BR>A spacious plain outstretched in circuit wide

<BR>Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers flowed,

<BR>The one winding, the other straight, and left between

<BR>Fair champaign, with less rivers interveined,

<BR>Then meeting joined their tribute to the sea.

<BR>Fertil of corn the glebe, of oil, and wine;

<BR>With herds the pasture thronged, with flocks the hills;

<BR>Huge cities and high-towered, that well might seem

<BR>The seats of mightiest monarchs; and so large

<BR>The prospect was that here and there was room

<BR>For barren desert, fountainless and dry.

<BR>To this high mountain-top the Tempter brought

<BR>Our Saviour, and new train of words began:--

<BR>"Well have we speeded, and o'er hill and dale,

<BR>Forest, and field, and flood, temples and towers,

<BR>Cut shorter many a league. Here thou behold'st

<BR>Assyria, and her empire's ancient bounds,

<BR>Araxes and the Caspian lake; thence on

<BR>As far as Indus east, Euphrates west,

<BR>And oft beyond; to south the Persian bay,

<BR>And, inaccessible, the Arabian drouth:

<BR>Here, Nineveh, of length within her wall

<BR>Several days' journey, built by Ninus old,

<BR>Of that first golden monarchy the seat,

<BR>And seat of Salmanassar, whose success

<BR>Israel in long captivity still mourns;

<BR>There Babylon, the wonder of all tongues,

<BR>As ancient, but rebuilt by him who twice

<BR>Judah and all thy father David's house

<BR>Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste,

<BR>Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis,

<BR>His city, there thou seest, and Bactra there;

<BR>Ecbatana her structure vast there shews,

<BR>And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates;

<BR>There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream,

<BR>The drink of none but kings; of later fame,

<BR>Built by Emathian or by Parthian hands,

<BR>The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there

<BR>Artaxata, Teredon, Ctesiphon,

<BR>Turning with easy eye, thou may'st behold.

<BR>All these the Parthian (now some ages past

<BR>By great Arsaces led, who founded first

<BR>That empire) under his dominion holds,

<BR>From the luxurious kings of Antioch won.

<BR>And just in time thou com'st to have a view

<BR>Of his great power; for now the Parthian king

<BR>In Ctesiphon hath gathered all his host

<BR>Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild

<BR>Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid

<BR>He marches now in haste. See, though from far,

<BR>His thousands, in what martial equipage

<BR>They issue forth, steel bows and shafts their arms,

<BR>Of equal dread in flight or in pursuit--

<BR>All horsemen, in which fight they most excel;

<BR>See how in warlike muster they appear,

<BR>In rhombs, and wedges, and half-moons, and wings."

<BR>He looked, and saw what numbers numberless

<BR>The city gates outpoured, light-armed troops

<BR>In coats of mail and military pride.

<BR>In mail their horses clad, yet fleet and strong,

<BR>Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice

<BR>Of many provinces from bound to bound--

<BR>From Arachosia, from Candaor east,

<BR>And Margiana, to the Hyrcanian cliffs

<BR>Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales;

<BR>From Atropatia, and the neighbouring plains

<BR>Of Adiabene, Media, and the south

<BR>Of Susiana, to Balsara's haven.

<BR>He saw them in their forms of battle ranged,

<BR>How quick they wheeled, and flying behind them shot

<BR>Sharp sleet of arrowy showers against the face

<BR>Of their pursuers, and overcame by flight;

<BR>The field all iron cast a gleaming brown.

<BR>Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor, on each horn,

<BR>Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight,

<BR>Chariots, or elephants indorsed with towers

<BR>Of archers; nor of labouring pioners

<BR>A multitude, with spades and axes armed,

<BR>To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill,

<BR>Or where plain was raise hill, or overlay

<BR>With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke:

<BR>Mules after these, camels and dromedaries,

<BR>And waggons fraught with utensils of war.

<BR>Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp,

<BR>When Agrican, with all his northern powers,

<BR>Besieged Albracea, as romances tell,

<BR>The city of Gallaphrone, from thence to win

<BR>The fairest of her sex, Angelica,

<BR>His daughter, sought by many prowest knights,

<BR>Both Paynim and the peers of Charlemane.

<BR>Such and so numerous was their chivalry;

<BR>At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presumed,

<BR>And to our Saviour thus his words renewed:--

<BR>"That thou may'st know I seek not to engage

<BR>Thy virtue, and not every way secure

<BR>On no slight grounds thy safety, hear and mark

<BR>To what end I have brought thee hither, and shew

<BR>All this fair sight. Thy kingdom, though foretold

<BR>By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou

<BR>Endeavour, as thy father David did,

<BR>Thou never shalt obtain: prediction still

<BR>In all things, and all men, supposes means;

<BR>Without means used, what it predicts revokes.

<BR>But say thou wert possessed of David's throne

<BR>By free consent of all, none opposite,

<BR>Samaritan or Jew; how couldst thou hope

<BR>Long to enjoy it quiet and secure

<BR>Between two such enclosing enemies,

<BR>Roman and Parthian? Therefore one of these

<BR>Thou must make sure thy own: the Parthian first,

<BR>By my advice, as nearer, and of late

<BR>Found able by invasion to annoy

<BR>Thy country, and captive lead away her kings,

<BR>Antigonus and old Hyrcanus, bound,

<BR>Maugre the Roman. It shall be my task

<BR>To render thee the Parthian at dispose,

<BR>Choose which thou wilt, by conquest or by league.

<BR>By him thou shalt regain, without him not,

<BR>That which alone can truly reinstall thee

<BR>In David's royal seat, his true successor--

<BR>Deliverance of thy brethren, those Ten Tribes

<BR>Whose offspring in his territory yet serve

<BR>In Habor, and among the Medes dispersed:

<BR>The sons of Jacob, two of Joseph, lost

<BR>Thus long from Israel, serving, as of old

<BR>Their fathers in the land of Egypt served,

<BR>This offer sets before thee to deliver.

<BR>These if from servitude thou shalt restore

<BR>To their inheritance, then, nor till then,

<BR>Thou on the throne of David in full glory,

<BR>From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond,

<BR>Shalt reign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear."

<BR>To whom our Saviour answered thus, unmoved:--

<BR>"Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm

<BR>And fragile arms, much instrument of war,

<BR>Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought,

<BR>Before mine eyes thou hast set, and in my ear

<BR>Vented much policy, and projects deep

<BR>Of enemies, of aids, battles, and leagues,

<BR>Plausible to the world, to me worth naught.

<BR>Means I must use, thou say'st; prediction else

<BR>Will unpredict, and fail me of the throne!

<BR>My time, I told thee (and that time for thee

<BR>Were better farthest off), is not yet come.

<BR>When that comes, think not thou to find me slack

<BR>On my part aught endeavouring, or to need

<BR>Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome

<BR>Luggage of war there shewn me--argument

<BR>Of human weakness rather than of strength.

<BR>My brethren, as thou call'st them, those Ten Tribes,

<BR>I must deliver, if I mean to reign

<BR>David's true heir, and his full sceptre sway

<BR>To just extent over all Israel's sons!

<BR>But whence to thee this zeal? Where was it then

<BR>For Israel, or for David, or his throne,

<BR>When thou stood'st up his tempter to the pride

<BR>Of numbering Israel--which cost the lives

<BR>of threescore and ten thousand Israelites

<BR>By three days' pestilence? Such was thy zeal

<BR>To Israel then, the same that now to me.

<BR>As for those captive tribes, themselves were they

<BR>Who wrought their own captivity, fell off

<BR>From God to worship calves, the deities

<BR>Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth,

<BR>And all the idolatries of heathen round,

<BR>Besides their other worse than heathenish crimes;

<BR>Nor in the land of their captivity

<BR>Humbled themselves, or penitent besought

<BR>The God of their forefathers, but so died

<BR>Impenitent, and left a race behind

<BR>Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce

<BR>From Gentiles, but by circumcision vain,

<BR>And God with idols in their worship joined.

<BR>Should I of these the liberty regard,

<BR>Who, freed, as to their ancient patrimony,

<BR>Unhumbled, unrepentant, unreformed,

<BR>Headlong would follow, and to their gods perhaps

<BR>Of Bethel and of Dan? No; let them serve

<BR>Their enemies who serve idols with God.

<BR>Yet He at length, time to himself best known,

<BR>Remembering Abraham, by some wondrous call

<BR>May bring them back, repentant and sincere,

<BR>And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood,

<BR>While to their native land with joy they haste,

<BR>As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft,

<BR>When to the Promised Land their fathers passed.

<BR>To his due time and providence I leave them."

<BR>So spake Israel's true King, and to the Fiend

<BR>Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles.

<BR>So fares it when with truth falsehood contends.</BLOCKQUOTE>
