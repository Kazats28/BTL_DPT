<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>In a room a woman sat at a table eating like a fat monk in a picture.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A soiled, unshaven man pushed open the door and entered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said he, "Mag's dead."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What?" said the woman, her mouth filled with bread.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mag's dead," repeated the man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Deh hell she is," said the woman.&nbsp; She continued her meal.



<P>When she finished her coffee she began to weep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I kin remember when her two feet was no bigger dan yer t'umb,



<P>and she weared worsted boots," moaned she.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, whata dat?" said the man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I kin remember when she weared worsted boots," she cried.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The neighbors began to gather in the hall, staring in at the



<P>weeping woman as if watching the contortions of a dying dog.&nbsp; A



<P>dozen women entered and lamented with her.&nbsp; Under their busy hands



<P>the rooms took on that appalling appearance of neatness and order



<P>with which death is greeted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Suddenly the door opened and a woman in a black gown rushed in



<P>with outstretched arms.&nbsp; "Ah, poor Mary," she cried, and tenderly



<P>embraced the moaning one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, what ter'ble affliction is dis," continued she.&nbsp; Her vocabulary



<P>was derived from mission churches.&nbsp; "Me poor Mary, how I feel fer

yehs!



<P>Ah, what a ter'ble affliction is a disobed'ent chil'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her good, motherly face was wet with tears.&nbsp; She trembled in



<P>eagerness to express her sympathy.&nbsp; The mourner sat with bowed

head,



<P>rocking her body heavily to and fro, and crying out in a high,



<P>strained voice that sounded like a dirge on some forlorn pipe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I kin remember when she weared worsted boots an' her two



<P>feets was no bigger dan yer t'umb an' she weared worsted boots,



<P>Miss Smith," she cried, raising her streaming eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, me poor Mary," sobbed the woman in black.&nbsp; With low,



<P>coddling cries, she sank on her knees by the mourner's chair,



<P>and put her arms about her.&nbsp; The other women began to groan



<P>in different keys.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yer poor misguided chil' is gone now, Mary, an' let us hope



<P>it's fer deh bes'.&nbsp; Yeh'll fergive her now, Mary, won't yehs, dear,



<P>all her disobed'ence?&nbsp; All her t'ankless behavior to her mudder

an'



<P>all her badness?&nbsp; She's gone where her ter'ble sins will be judged."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman in black raised her face and paused.&nbsp; The inevitable



<P>sunlight came streaming in at the windows and shed a ghastly



<P>cheerfulness upon the faded hues of the room.&nbsp; Two or three of

the



<P>spectators were sniffling, and one was loudly weeping.&nbsp; The



<P>mourner arose and staggered into the other room.&nbsp; In a moment she



<P>emerged with a pair of faded baby shoes held in the hollow of her hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I kin remember when she used to wear dem," cried she.



<P>The women burst anew into cries as if they had all been stabbed.



<P>The mourner turned to the soiled and unshaven man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jimmie, boy, go git yer sister!&nbsp; Go git yer sister an' we'll



<P>put deh boots on her feets!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dey won't fit her now, yeh damn fool," said the man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go git yer sister, Jimmie," shrieked the woman, confronting



<P>him fiercely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The man swore sullenly.&nbsp; He went over to a corner and slowly



<P>began to put on his coat.&nbsp; He took his hat and went out, with a



<P>dragging, reluctant step.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman in black came forward and again besought the mourner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yeh'll fergive her, Mary!&nbsp; Yeh'll fergive yer bad, bad,



<P>chil'!&nbsp; Her life was a curse an' her days were black an' yeh'll



<P>fergive yer bad girl?&nbsp; She's gone where her sins will be judged."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She's gone where her sins will be judged," cried the other



<P>women, like a choir at a funeral.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Deh Lord gives and deh Lord takes away," said the woman in



<P>black, raising her eyes to the sunbeams.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Deh Lord gives and deh Lord takes away," responded the others.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yeh'll fergive her, Mary!" pleaded the woman in black.&nbsp; The



<P>mourner essayed to speak but her voice gave way.&nbsp; She shook her



<P>great shoulders frantically, in an agony of grief.&nbsp; Hot tears



<P>seemed to scald her quivering face.&nbsp; Finally her voice came and



<P>arose like a scream of pain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, yes, I'll fergive her!&nbsp; I'll fergive her!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>As thoughts of Pete came to Maggie's mind, she began to have



<P>an intense dislike for all of her dresses.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What deh hell ails yeh?&nbsp; What makes yeh be allus fixin' and



<P>fussin'?&nbsp; Good Gawd," her mother would frequently roar at her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She began to note, with more interest, the well-dressed women



<P>she met on the avenues.&nbsp; She envied elegance and soft palms.&nbsp;

She



<P>craved those adornments of person which she saw every day on the



<P>street, conceiving them to be allies of vast importance to women.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Studying faces, she thought many of the women and girls she



<P>chanced to meet, smiled with serenity as though forever cherished



<P>and watched over by those they loved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The air in the collar and cuff establishment strangled her.



<P>She knew she was gradually and surely shrivelling in the hot,



<P>stuffy room.&nbsp; The begrimed windows rattled incessantly from the



<P>passing of elevated trains.&nbsp; The place was filled with a whirl

of



<P>noises and odors.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She wondered as she regarded some of the grizzled women in the



<P>room, mere mechanical contrivances sewing seams and grinding out,



<P>with heads bended over their work, tales of imagined or real



<P>girlhood happiness, past drunks, the baby at home, and unpaid wages.



<P>She speculated how long her youth would endure.&nbsp; She began to see



<P>the bloom upon her cheeks as valuable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She imagined herself, in an exasperating future, as a scrawny



<P>woman with an eternal grievance.&nbsp; Too, she thought Pete to be



<P>a very fastidious person concerning the appearance of women.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She felt she would love to see somebody entangle their fingers



<P>in the oily beard of the fat foreigner who owned the establishment.



<P>He was a detestable creature.&nbsp; He wore white socks with low shoes.



<P>When he tired of this amusement he would go to the mummies and



<P>moralize over them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Usually he submitted with silent dignity to all which he had



<P>to go through, but, at times, he was goaded into comment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What deh hell," he demanded once.&nbsp; "Look at all dese little



<P>jugs!&nbsp; Hundred jugs in a row!&nbsp; Ten rows in a case an' 'bout

a



<P>t'ousand cases!&nbsp; What deh blazes use is dem?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Evenings during the week he took her to see plays in which the



<P>brain-clutching heroine was rescued from the palatial home of her



<P>guardian, who is cruelly after her bonds, by the hero with the



<P>beautiful sentiments.&nbsp; The latter spent most of his time out at



<P>soak in pale-green snow storms, busy with a nickel-plated revolver,



<P>rescuing aged strangers from villains.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie lost herself in sympathy with the wanderers swooning in



<P>snow storms beneath happy-hued church windows.&nbsp; And a choir within



<P>singing "Joy to the World."&nbsp; To Maggie and the rest of the audience



<P>this was transcendental realism.&nbsp; Joy always within, and they,

like



<P>the actor, inevitably without.&nbsp; Viewing it, they hugged themselves



<P>in ecstatic pity of their imagined or real condition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girl thought the arrogance and granite-heartedness of the



<P>magnate of the play was very accurately drawn.&nbsp; She echoed the



<P>maledictions that the occupants of the gallery showered on this



<P>individual when his lines compelled him to expose his extreme



<P>selfishness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Shady persons in the audience revolted from the pictured



<P>villainy of the drama.&nbsp; With untiring zeal they hissed vice and



<P>applauded virtue.&nbsp; Unmistakably bad men evinced an apparently



<P>sincere admiration for virtue.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The loud gallery was overwhelmingly with the unfortunate and the



<P>oppressed.&nbsp; They encouraged the struggling hero with cries, and



<P>jeered the villain, hooting and calling attention to his whiskers.



<P>When anybody died in the pale-green snow storms, the gallery mourned.



<P>They sought out the painted misery and hugged it as akin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the hero's erratic march from poverty in the first act, to



<P>wealth and triumph in the final one, in which he forgives all the



<P>enemies that he has left, he was assisted by the gallery, which



<P>applauded his generous and noble sentiments and confounded the



<P>speeches of his opponents by making irrelevant but very sharp



<P>remarks.&nbsp; Those actors who were cursed with villainy parts were



<P>confronted at every turn by the gallery.&nbsp; If one of them rendered



<P>lines containing the most subtile distinctions between right and



<P>wrong, the gallery was immediately aware if the actor meant



<P>wickedness, and denounced him accordingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The last act was a triumph for the hero, poor and of the



<P>masses, the representative of the audience, over the villain



<P>and the rich man, his pockets stuffed with bonds, his heart packed



<P>with tyrannical purposes, imperturbable amid suffering.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie always departed with raised spirits from the showing



<P>places of the melodrama.&nbsp; She rejoiced at the way in which the

poor



<P>and virtuous eventually surmounted the wealthy and wicked.&nbsp; The



<P>theatre made her think.&nbsp; She wondered if the culture and refinement



<P>she had seen imitated, perhaps grotesquely, by the heroine on the



<P>stage, could be acquired by a girl who lived in a tenement house



<P>and worked in a shirt factory.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>A group of urchins were intent upon the side door of a saloon.



<P>Expectancy gleamed from their eyes.&nbsp; They were twisting their



<P>fingers in excitement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here she comes," yelled one of them suddenly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The group of urchins burst instantly asunder and its



<P>individual fragments were spread in a wide, respectable half circle



<P>about the point of interest.&nbsp; The saloon door opened with a crash,



<P>and the figure of a woman appeared upon the threshold.&nbsp; Her grey



<P>hair fell in knotted masses about her shoulders.&nbsp; Her face was



<P>crimsoned and wet with perspiration.&nbsp; Her eyes had a rolling glare.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a damn cent more of me money will yehs ever get, not a damn cent.



<P>I spent me money here fer t'ree years an' now yehs tells me yeh'll



<P>sell me no more stuff!&nbsp; T'hell wid yeh, Johnnie Murckre!&nbsp;

'Disturbance'?



<P>Disturbance be damned!&nbsp; T'hell wid yeh, Johnnie--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The door received a kick of exasperation from within and the



<P>woman lurched heavily out on the sidewalk.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The gamins in the half-circle became violently agitated.



<P>They began to dance about and hoot and yell and jeer.



<P>Wide dirty grins spread over each face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman made a furious dash at a particularly outrageous



<P>cluster of little boys.&nbsp; They laughed delightedly and scampered

off



<P>a short distance, calling out over their shoulders to her.&nbsp; She



<P>stood tottering on the curb-stone and thundered at them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yeh devil's kids," she howled, shaking red fists.&nbsp; The little

boys



<P>whooped in glee.&nbsp; As she started up the street they fell in behind



<P>and marched uproariously.&nbsp; Occasionally she wheeled about and made



<P>charges on them.&nbsp; They ran nimbly out of reach and taunted her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the frame of a gruesome doorway she stood for a moment cursing them.



<P>Her hair straggled, giving her crimson features a look of insanity.



<P>Her great fists quivered as she shook them madly in the air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The urchins made terrific noises until she turned and



<P>disappeared.&nbsp; Then they filed quietly in the way they had come.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman floundered about in the lower hall of the tenement house



<P>and finally stumbled up the stairs.&nbsp; On an upper hall a door was



<P>opened and a collection of heads peered curiously out, watching her.



<P>With a wrathful snort the woman confronted the door, but it was



<P>slammed hastily in her face and the key was turned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She stood for a few minutes, delivering a frenzied challenge at the

panels.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come out in deh hall, Mary Murphy, damn yeh, if yehs want a row.



<P>Come ahn, yeh overgrown terrier, come ahn."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She began to kick the door with her great feet.&nbsp; She shrilly



<P>defied the universe to appear and do battle.&nbsp; Her cursing trebles



<P>brought heads from all doors save the one she threatened.&nbsp; Her

eyes



<P>glared in every direction.&nbsp; The air was full of her tossing fists.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come ahn, deh hull damn gang of yehs, come ahn," she roared at



<P>the spectators.&nbsp; An oath or two, cat-calls, jeers and bits of



<P>facetious advice were given in reply.&nbsp; Missiles clattered



<P>about her feet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What deh hell's deh matter wid yeh?" said a voice in the



<P>gathered gloom, and Jimmie came forward.&nbsp; He carried a tin dinner-



<P>pail in his hand and under his arm a brown truckman's apron done in



<P>a bundle.&nbsp; "What deh hell's wrong?" he demanded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come out, all of yehs, come out," his mother was howling.



<P>"Come ahn an' I'll stamp her damn brains under me feet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shet yer face, an' come home, yeh damned old fool," roared



<P>Jimmie at her.&nbsp; She strided up to him and twirled her fingers in



<P>his face.&nbsp; Her eyes were darting flames of unreasoning rage and

her



<P>frame trembled with eagerness for a fight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"T'hell wid yehs!&nbsp; An' who deh hell are yehs?&nbsp; I ain't givin'

a snap



<P>of me fingers fer yehs," she bawled at him.&nbsp; She turned her huge

back



<P>in tremendous disdain and climbed the stairs to the next floor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie followed, cursing blackly.&nbsp; At the top of the flight he



<P>seized his mother's arm and started to drag her toward the door of



<P>their room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come home, damn yeh," he gritted between his teeth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Take yer hands off me!&nbsp; Take yer hands off me," shrieked his mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She raised her arm and whirled her great fist at her son's



<P>face.&nbsp; Jimmie dodged his head and the blow struck him in the back



<P>of the neck.&nbsp; "Damn yeh," gritted he again.&nbsp; He threw out

his left



<P>hand and writhed his fingers about her middle arm.&nbsp; The mother

and



<P>the son began to sway and struggle like gladiators.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Whoop!" said the Rum Alley tenement house.&nbsp; The hall filled



<P>with interested spectators.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hi, ol' lady, dat was a dandy!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"T'ree to one on deh red!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, stop yer damn scrappin'!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The door of the Johnson home opened and Maggie looked out.



<P>Jimmie made a supreme cursing effort and hurled his mother



<P>into the room.&nbsp; He quickly followed and closed the door.



<P>The Rum Alley tenement swore disappointedly and retired.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mother slowly gathered herself up from the floor.



<P>Her eyes glittered menacingly upon her children.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here, now," said Jimmie, "we've had enough of dis.&nbsp; Sit down,



<P>an' don' make no trouble."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He grasped her arm, and twisting it, forced her into a



<P>creaking chair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Keep yer hands off me," roared his mother again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Damn yer ol' hide," yelled Jimmie, madly.&nbsp; Maggie shrieked



<P>and ran into the other room.&nbsp; To her there came the sound of a



<P>storm of crashes and curses.&nbsp; There was a great final thump and



<P>Jimmie's voice cried: "Dere, damn yeh, stay still."&nbsp; Maggie opened



<P>the door now, and went warily out.&nbsp; "Oh, Jimmie."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was leaning against the wall and swearing.&nbsp; Blood stood



<P>upon bruises on his knotty fore-arms where they had scraped against



<P>the floor or the walls in the scuffle.&nbsp; The mother lay screeching



<P>on the floor, the tears running down her furrowed face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie, standing in the middle of the room, gazed about her.



<P>The usual upheaval of the tables and chairs had taken place.



<P>Crockery was strewn broadcast in fragments.&nbsp; The stove had been



<P>disturbed on its legs, and now leaned idiotically to one side.



<P>A pail had been upset and water spread in all directions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The door opened and Pete appeared.&nbsp; He shrugged his shoulders.



<P>"Oh, Gawd," he observed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He walked over to Maggie and whispered in her ear.&nbsp; "Ah, what



<P>deh hell, Mag?&nbsp; Come ahn and we'll have a hell of a time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mother in the corner upreared her head and shook her



<P>tangled locks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Teh hell wid him and you," she said, glowering at her



<P>daughter in the gloom.&nbsp; Her eyes seemed to burn balefully.&nbsp;

"Yeh've



<P>gone teh deh devil, Mag Johnson, yehs knows yehs have gone teh deh



<P>devil.&nbsp; Yer a disgrace teh yer people, damn yeh.&nbsp; An' now,

git out



<P>an' go ahn wid dat doe-faced jude of yours.&nbsp; Go teh hell wid him,



<P>damn yeh, an' a good riddance.&nbsp; Go teh hell an' see how yeh likes



<P>it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie gazed long at her mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go teh hell now, an' see how yeh likes it.&nbsp; Git out.&nbsp; I won't



<P>have sech as yehs in me house!&nbsp; Get out, d'yeh hear!&nbsp; Damn

yeh,



<P>git out!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girl began to tremble.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At this instant Pete came forward.&nbsp; "Oh, what deh hell, Mag, see,"



<P>whispered he softly in her ear.&nbsp; "Dis all blows over.&nbsp; See?&nbsp;

Deh ol'



<P>woman 'ill be all right in deh mornin'.&nbsp; Come ahn out wid me!



<P>We'll have a hell of a time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman on the floor cursed.&nbsp; Jimmie was intent upon his



<P>bruised fore-arms.&nbsp; The girl cast a glance about the room filled

with



<P>a chaotic mass of debris, and at the red, writhing body of her mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go teh hell an' good riddance."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She went.

<P>Jimmie did not return home for a number of days after the



<P>fight with Pete in the saloon.&nbsp; When he did, he approached with



<P>extreme caution.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He found his mother raving.&nbsp; Maggie had not returned home.



<P>The parent continually wondered how her daughter could come to such



<P>a pass.&nbsp; She had never considered Maggie as a pearl dropped



<P>unstained into Rum Alley from Heaven, but she could not conceive



<P>how it was possible for her daughter to fall so low as to bring



<P>disgrace upon her family.&nbsp; She was terrific in denunciation of

the



<P>girl's wickedness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The fact that the neighbors talked of it, maddened her.&nbsp; When



<P>women came in, and in the course of their conversation casually



<P>asked, "Where's Maggie dese days?" the mother shook her fuzzy head



<P>at them and appalled them with curses.&nbsp; Cunning hints inviting



<P>confidence she rebuffed with violence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"An' wid all deh bringin' up she had, how could she?"



<P>moaningly she asked of her son.&nbsp; "Wid all deh talkin' wid her I

did



<P>an' deh t'ings I tol' her to remember?&nbsp; When a girl is bringed

up



<P>deh way I bringed up Maggie, how kin she go teh deh devil?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie was transfixed by these questions.&nbsp; He could not



<P>conceive how under the circumstances his mother's daughter and his



<P>sister could have been so wicked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His mother took a drink from a squdgy bottle that sat on the



<P>table.&nbsp; She continued her lament.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She had a bad heart, dat girl did, Jimmie.&nbsp; She was wicked



<P>teh deh heart an' we never knowed it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie nodded, admitting the fact.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We lived in deh same house wid her an' I brought her up an'



<P>we never knowed how bad she was."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie nodded again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Wid a home like dis an' a mudder like me, she went teh deh



<P>bad," cried the mother, raising her eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One day, Jimmie came home, sat down in a chair and began to



<P>wriggle about with a new and strange nervousness.&nbsp; At last he spoke



<P>shamefacedly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, look-a-here, dis t'ing queers us!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; We're queered!



<P>An' maybe it 'ud be better if I--well, I t'ink I kin look 'er up



<P>an'--maybe it 'ud be better if I fetched her home an'--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mother started from her chair and broke forth into a storm



<P>of passionate anger.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What!&nbsp; Let 'er come an' sleep under deh same roof wid her



<P>mudder agin!&nbsp; Oh, yes, I will, won't I?&nbsp; Sure?&nbsp; Shame

on yehs,



<P>Jimmie Johnson, for sayin' such a t'ing teh yer own mudder--teh yer



<P>own mudder!&nbsp; Little did I t'ink when yehs was a babby playin' about



<P>me feet dat ye'd grow up teh say sech a t'ing teh yer mudder--yer



<P>own mudder.&nbsp; I never taut--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sobs choked her and interrupted her reproaches.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dere ain't nottin' teh raise sech hell about," said Jimmie.



<P>"I on'y says it 'ud be better if we keep dis t'ing dark, see?



<P>It queers us!&nbsp; See?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His mother laughed a laugh that seemed to ring through the



<P>city and be echoed and re-echoed by countless other laughs.



<P>"Oh, yes, I will, won't I!&nbsp; Sure!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, yeh must take me fer a damn fool," said Jimmie,



<P>indignant at his mother for mocking him.&nbsp; "I didn't say we'd make



<P>'er inteh a little tin angel, ner nottin', but deh way it is now



<P>she can queer us!&nbsp; Don' che see?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aye, she'll git tired of deh life atter a while an' den



<P>she'll wanna be a-comin' home, won' she, deh beast!&nbsp; I'll let 'er



<P>in den, won' I?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I didn' mean none of dis prod'gal bus'ness anyway,"



<P>explained Jimmie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It wasn't no prod'gal dauter, yeh damn fool," said the



<P>mother.&nbsp; "It was prod'gal son, anyhow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know dat," said Jimmie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For a time they sat in silence.&nbsp; The mother's eyes gloated on



<P>a scene her imagination could call before her.&nbsp; Her lips were set



<P>in a vindictive smile.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aye, she'll cry, won' she, an' carry on, an' tell how Pete,



<P>or some odder feller, beats 'er an' she'll say she's sorry an' all



<P>dat an' she ain't happy, she ain't, an' she wants to come home agin,



<P>she does."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With grim humor, the mother imitated the possible wailing



<P>notes of the daughter's voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Den I'll take 'er in, won't I, deh beast.&nbsp; She kin cry 'er two

eyes out



<P>on deh stones of deh street before I'll dirty deh place wid her.



<P>She abused an' ill-treated her own mudder--her own mudder what



<P>loved her an' she'll never git anodder chance dis side of hell."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie thought he had a great idea of women's frailty, but he



<P>could not understand why any of his kin should be victims.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Damn her," he fervidly said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Again he wondered vaguely if some of the women of his acquaintance



<P>had brothers.&nbsp; Nevertheless, his mind did not for an instant



<P>confuse himself with those brothers nor his sister with theirs.



<P>After the mother had, with great difficulty, suppressed the



<P>neighbors, she went among them and proclaimed her grief.



<P>"May Gawd forgive dat girl," was her continual cry.&nbsp; To attentive



<P>ears she recited the whole length and breadth of her woes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I bringed 'er up deh way a dauter oughta be bringed up an'



<P>dis is how she served me!&nbsp; She went teh deh devil deh first chance



<P>she got!&nbsp; May Gawd forgive her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When arrested for drunkenness she used the story of her



<P>daughter's downfall with telling effect upon the police justices.



<P>Finally one of them said to her, peering down over his spectacles:



<P>"Mary, the records of this and other courts show that you are the



<P>mother of forty-two daughters who have been ruined.&nbsp; The case



<P>is unparalleled in the annals of this court, and this court



<P>thinks--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mother went through life shedding large tears of sorrow.



<P>Her red face was a picture of agony.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of course Jimmie publicly damned his sister that he might



<P>appear on a higher social plane.&nbsp; But, arguing with himself,



<P>stumbling about in ways that he knew not, he, once, almost came to



<P>a conclusion that his sister would have been more firmly good had



<P>she better known why.&nbsp; However, he felt that he could not hold

such



<P>a view.&nbsp; He threw it hastily aside.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>An orchestra of yellow silk women and bald-headed men on an



<P>elevated stage near the centre of a great green-hued hall, played



<P>a popular waltz.&nbsp; The place was crowded with people grouped



<P>about little tables.&nbsp; A battalion of waiters slid among the throng,



<P>carrying trays of beer glasses and making change from the



<P>inexhaustible vaults of their trousers pockets.&nbsp; Little boys, in



<P>the costumes of French chefs, paraded up and down the irregular



<P>aisles vending fancy cakes.&nbsp; There was a low rumble of conversation



<P>and a subdued clinking of glasses.&nbsp; Clouds of tobacco smoke rolled



<P>and wavered high in air about the dull gilt of the chandeliers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The vast crowd had an air throughout of having just quitted



<P>labor.&nbsp; Men with calloused hands and attired in garments that



<P>showed the wear of an endless trudge for a living, smoked their



<P>pipes contentedly and spent five, ten, or perhaps fifteen cents for



<P>beer.&nbsp; There was a mere sprinkling of kid-gloved men who smoked



<P>cigars purchased elsewhere.&nbsp; The great body of the crowd was



<P>composed of people who showed that all day they strove with their



<P>hands.&nbsp; Quiet Germans, with maybe their wives and two or three



<P>children, sat listening to the music, with the expressions of happy



<P>cows.&nbsp; An occasional party of sailors from a war-ship, their faces



<P>pictures of sturdy health, spent the earlier hours of the evening



<P>at the small round tables.&nbsp; Very infrequent tipsy men, swollen

with



<P>the value of their opinions, engaged their companions in earnest



<P>and confidential conversation.&nbsp; In the balcony, and here and there



<P>below, shone the impassive faces of women.&nbsp; The nationalities of



<P>the Bowery beamed upon the stage from all directions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pete aggressively walked up a side aisle and took seats with



<P>Maggie at a table beneath the balcony.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Two beehs!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Leaning back he regarded with eyes of superiority the scene



<P>before them.&nbsp; This attitude affected Maggie strongly.&nbsp; A man

who



<P>could regard such a sight with indifference must be accustomed to



<P>very great things.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was obvious that Pete had been to this place many times



<P>before, and was very familiar with it.&nbsp; A knowledge of this fact



<P>made Maggie feel little and new.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was extremely gracious and attentive.&nbsp; He displayed the



<P>consideration of a cultured gentleman who knew what was due.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Say, what deh hell?&nbsp; Bring deh lady a big glass!&nbsp; What deh



<P>hell use is dat pony?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't be fresh, now," said the waiter, with some warmth, as



<P>he departed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, git off deh eart'," said Pete, after the other's



<P>retreating form.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie perceived that Pete brought forth all his elegance and



<P>all his knowledge of high-class customs for her benefit.&nbsp; Her heart



<P>warmed as she reflected upon his condescension.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The orchestra of yellow silk women and bald-headed men gave



<P>vent to a few bars of anticipatory music and a girl, in a pink



<P>dress with short skirts, galloped upon the stage.&nbsp; She smiled upon



<P>the throng as if in acknowledgment of a warm welcome, and began to



<P>walk to and fro, making profuse gesticulations and singing, in



<P>brazen soprano tones, a song, the words of which were inaudible.



<P>When she broke into the swift rattling measures of a chorus some



<P>half-tipsy men near the stage joined in the rollicking refrain and



<P>glasses were pounded rhythmically upon the tables.&nbsp; People leaned



<P>forward to watch her and to try to catch the words of the song.



<P>When she vanished there were long rollings of applause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Obedient to more anticipatory bars, she reappeared amidst the



<P>half-suppressed cheering of the tipsy men.&nbsp; The orchestra plunged



<P>into dance music and the laces of the dancer fluttered and flew in



<P>the glare of gas jets.&nbsp; She divulged the fact that she was attired



<P>in some half dozen skirts.&nbsp; It was patent that any one of them



<P>would have proved adequate for the purpose for which skirts are



<P>intended.&nbsp; An occasional man bent forward, intent upon the pink



<P>stockings.&nbsp; Maggie wondered at the splendor of the costume and

lost



<P>herself in calculations of the cost of the silks and laces.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The dancer's smile of stereotyped enthusiasm was turned for



<P>ten minutes upon the faces of her audience.&nbsp; In the finale she

fell



<P>into some of those grotesque attitudes which were at the time



<P>popular among the dancers in the theatres up-town, giving to the



<P>Bowery public the phantasies of the aristocratic theatre-going



<P>public, at reduced rates.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Say, Pete," said Maggie, leaning forward, "dis is great."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sure," said Pete, with proper complacence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A ventriloquist followed the dancer.&nbsp; He held two fantastic



<P>dolls on his knees.&nbsp; He made them sing mournful ditties and say



<P>funny things about geography and Ireland.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do dose little men talk?" asked Maggie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Naw," said Pete, "it's some damn fake.&nbsp; See?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Two girls, on the bills as sisters, came forth and sang a duet



<P>that is heard occasionally at concerts given under church auspices.



<P>They supplemented it with a dance which of course can never



<P>be seen at concerts given under church auspices.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After the duettists had retired, a woman of debatable age sang



<P>a negro melody.&nbsp; The chorus necessitated some grotesque waddlings



<P>supposed to be an imitation of a plantation darkey, under the



<P>influence, probably, of music and the moon.&nbsp; The audience was just



<P>enthusiastic enough over it to have her return and sing a sorrowful



<P>lay, whose lines told of a mother's love and a sweetheart who



<P>waited and a young man who was lost at sea under the most harrowing



<P>circumstances.&nbsp; From the faces of a score or so in the crowd, the



<P>self-contained look faded.&nbsp; Many heads were bent forward with



<P>eagerness and sympathy.&nbsp; As the last distressing sentiment of the



<P>piece was brought forth, it was greeted by that kind of applause



<P>which rings as sincere.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As a final effort, the singer rendered some verses which



<P>described a vision of Britain being annihilated by America, and



<P>Ireland bursting her bonds.&nbsp; A carefully prepared crisis was



<P>reached in the last line of the last verse, where the singer threw



<P>out her arms and cried, "The star-spangled banner."&nbsp; Instantly

a



<P>great cheer swelled from the throats of the assemblage of the



<P>masses.&nbsp; There was a heavy rumble of booted feet thumping the



<P>floor.&nbsp; Eyes gleamed with sudden fire, and calloused hands waved



<P>frantically in the air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a few moments' rest, the orchestra played crashingly,



<P>and a small fat man burst out upon the stage.&nbsp; He began to roar

a



<P>song and stamp back and forth before the foot-lights, wildly waving



<P>a glossy silk hat and throwing leers, or smiles, broadcast.&nbsp; He



<P>made his face into fantastic grimaces until he looked like a



<P>pictured devil on a Japanese kite.&nbsp; The crowd laughed gleefully.



<P>His short, fat legs were never still a moment.&nbsp; He shouted and



<P>roared and bobbed his shock of red wig until the audience broke out



<P>in excited applause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pete did not pay much attention to the progress of events upon



<P>the stage.&nbsp; He was drinking beer and watching Maggie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her cheeks were blushing with excitement and her eyes were



<P>glistening.&nbsp; She drew deep breaths of pleasure.&nbsp; No thoughts

of the



<P>atmosphere of the collar and cuff factory came to her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the orchestra crashed finally, they jostled their way to



<P>the sidewalk with the crowd.&nbsp; Pete took Maggie's arm and pushed

a



<P>way for her, offering to fight with a man or two.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They reached Maggie's home at a late hour and stood for a



<P>moment in front of the gruesome doorway.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Say, Mag," said Pete, "give us a kiss for takin' yeh teh deh



<P>show, will yer?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie laughed, as if startled, and drew away from him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Naw, Pete," she said, "dat wasn't in it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, what deh hell?" urged Pete.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girl retreated nervously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, what deh hell?" repeated he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie darted into the hall, and up the stairs.&nbsp; She turned



<P>and smiled at him, then disappeared.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pete walked slowly down the street.&nbsp; He had something of an



<P>astonished expression upon his features.&nbsp; He paused under a lamp-



<P>post and breathed a low breath of surprise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gawd," he said, "I wonner if I've been played fer a duffer."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Pete took note of Maggie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Say, Mag, I'm stuck on yer shape.&nbsp; It's outa sight," he said,



<P>parenthetically, with an affable grin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he became aware that she was listening closely, he grew



<P>still more eloquent in his descriptions of various happenings in



<P>his career.&nbsp; It appeared that he was invincible in fights.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why," he said, referring to a man with whom he had had a



<P>misunderstanding, "dat mug scrapped like a damn dago.&nbsp; Dat's right.



<P>He was dead easy.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; He tau't he was a scrapper.&nbsp;

But he foun'



<P>out diff'ent!&nbsp; Hully gee."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He walked to and fro in the small room, which seemed then to



<P>grow even smaller and unfit to hold his dignity, the attribute of



<P>a supreme warrior.&nbsp; That swing of the shoulders that had frozen

the



<P>timid when he was but a lad had increased with his growth and



<P>education at the ratio of ten to one.&nbsp; It, combined with the sneer



<P>upon his mouth, told mankind that there was nothing in space which



<P>could appall him.&nbsp; Maggie marvelled at him and surrounded him with



<P>greatness.&nbsp; She vaguely tried to calculate the altitude of the



<P>pinnacle from which he must have looked down upon her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I met a chump deh odder day way up in deh city," he said.&nbsp; "I



<P>was goin' teh see a frien' of mine.&nbsp; When I was a-crossin' deh



<P>street deh chump runned plump inteh me, an' den he turns aroun' an'



<P>says, 'Yer insolen' ruffin,' he says, like dat.&nbsp; 'Oh, gee,' I says,



<P>'oh, gee, go teh hell and git off deh eart',' I says, like dat.



<P>See?&nbsp; 'Go teh hell an' git off deh eart',' like dat.&nbsp; Den

deh



<P>blokie he got wild.&nbsp; He says I was a contempt'ble scoun'el,



<P>er somet'ing like dat, an' he says I was doom' teh everlastin'



<P>pe'dition an' all like dat.&nbsp; 'Gee,' I says, 'gee!&nbsp; Deh hell

I am,'



<P>I says.&nbsp; 'Deh hell I am,' like dat.&nbsp; An' den I slugged 'im.&nbsp;

See?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With Jimmie in his company, Pete departed in a sort of a blaze



<P>of glory from the Johnson home.&nbsp; Maggie, leaning from the window,



<P>watched him as he walked down the street.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here was a formidable man who disdained the strength of a



<P>world full of fists.&nbsp; Here was one who had contempt for brass-



<P>clothed power; one whose knuckles could defiantly ring against the



<P>granite of law.&nbsp; He was a knight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The two men went from under the glimmering street-lamp and



<P>passed into shadows.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Turning, Maggie contemplated the dark, dust-stained walls, and



<P>the scant and crude furniture of her home.&nbsp; A clock, in a



<P>splintered and battered oblong box of varnished wood, she suddenly



<P>regarded as an abomination.&nbsp; She noted that it ticked raspingly.



<P>The almost vanished flowers in the carpet-pattern, she conceived to



<P>be newly hideous.&nbsp; Some faint attempts she had made with blue



<P>ribbon, to freshen the appearance of a dingy curtain, she now saw



<P>to be piteous.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She wondered what Pete dined on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She reflected upon the collar and cuff factory.&nbsp; It began to



<P>appear to her mind as a dreary place of endless grinding.&nbsp; Pete's



<P>elegant occupation brought him, no doubt, into contact with people



<P>who had money and manners.&nbsp; it was probable that he had a large



<P>acquaintance of pretty girls.&nbsp; He must have great sums of money

to



<P>spend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To her the earth was composed of hardships and insults.&nbsp; She



<P>felt instant admiration for a man who openly defied it.&nbsp; She



<P>thought that if the grim angel of death should clutch his heart,



<P>Pete would shrug his shoulders and say: "Oh, ev'ryt'ing goes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She anticipated that he would come again shortly.&nbsp; She spent



<P>some of her week's pay in the purchase of flowered cretonne for a



<P>lambrequin.&nbsp; She made it with infinite care and hung it to the



<P>slightly-careening mantel, over the stove, in the kitchen.&nbsp; She



<P>studied it with painful anxiety from different points in the room.



<P>She wanted it to look well on Sunday night when, perhaps, Jimmie's



<P>friend would come.&nbsp; On Sunday night, however, Pete did not appear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Afterward the girl looked at it with a sense of humiliation.



<P>She was now convinced that Pete was superior to admiration for



<P>lambrequins.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A few evenings later Pete entered with fascinating innovations



<P>in his apparel.&nbsp; As she had seen him twice and he had different



<P>suits on each time, Maggie had a dim impression that his



<P>wardrobe was prodigiously extensive.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Say, Mag," he said, "put on yer bes' duds Friday night an'



<P>I'll take yehs teh deh show.&nbsp; See?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He spent a few moments in flourishing his clothes and then



<P>vanished, without having glanced at the lambrequin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Over the eternal collars and cuffs in the factory Maggie spent



<P>the most of three days in making imaginary sketches of Pete and his



<P>daily environment.&nbsp; She imagined some half dozen women in love

with



<P>him and thought he must lean dangerously toward an indefinite one,



<P>whom she pictured with great charms of person, but with an



<P>altogether contemptible disposition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She thought he must live in a blare of pleasure.&nbsp; He had friends,



<P>and people who were afraid of him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She saw the golden glitter of the place where Pete was to take



<P>her.&nbsp; An entertainment of many hues and many melodies where she

was



<P>afraid she might appear small and mouse-colored.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her mother drank whiskey all Friday morning.&nbsp; With lurid face



<P>and tossing hair she cursed and destroyed furniture all Friday



<P>afternoon.&nbsp; When Maggie came home at half-past six her mother lay



<P>asleep amidst the wreck of chairs and a table.&nbsp; Fragments of



<P>various household utensils were scattered about the floor.



<P>She had vented some phase of drunken fury upon the lambrequin.



<P>It lay in a bedraggled heap in the corner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hah," she snorted, sitting up suddenly, "where deh hell yeh



<P>been?&nbsp; Why deh hell don' yeh come home earlier?&nbsp; Been loafin'



<P>'round deh streets.&nbsp; Yer gettin' teh be a reg'lar devil."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Pete arrived Maggie, in a worn black dress, was waiting



<P>for him in the midst of a floor strewn with wreckage.&nbsp; The curtain



<P>at the window had been pulled by a heavy hand and hung by one tack,



<P>dangling to and fro in the draft through the cracks at the sash.



<P>The knots of blue ribbons appeared like violated flowers.&nbsp; The

fire



<P>in the stove had gone out.&nbsp; The displaced lids and open doors



<P>showed heaps of sullen grey ashes.&nbsp; The remnants of a meal,



<P>ghastly, like dead flesh, lay in a corner.&nbsp; Maggie's red mother,



<P>stretched on the floor, blasphemed and gave her daughter a bad name.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>In a hall of irregular shape sat Pete and Maggie drinking



<P>beer.&nbsp; A submissive orchestra dictated to by a spectacled man with



<P>frowsy hair and a dress suit, industriously followed the bobs of



<P>his head and the waves of his baton.&nbsp; A ballad singer, in a dress



<P>of flaming scarlet, sang in the inevitable voice of brass.&nbsp; When



<P>she vanished, men seated at the tables near the front applauded



<P>loudly, pounding the polished wood with their beer glasses.&nbsp; She



<P>returned attired in less gown, and sang again.&nbsp; She received



<P>another enthusiastic encore.&nbsp; She reappeared in still less gown

and



<P>danced.&nbsp; The deafening rumble of glasses and clapping of hands

that



<P>followed her exit indicated an overwhelming desire to have her come



<P>on for the fourth time, but the curiosity of the audience was not



<P>gratified.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie was pale.&nbsp; From her eyes had been plucked all look of



<P>self-reliance.&nbsp; She leaned with a dependent air toward her



<P>companion.&nbsp; She was timid, as if fearing his anger or displeasure.



<P>She seemed to beseech tenderness of him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pete's air of distinguished valor had grown upon him until it



<P>threatened stupendous dimensions.&nbsp; He was infinitely gracious to



<P>the girl.&nbsp; It was apparent to her that his condescension was a

marvel.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He could appear to strut even while sitting still and he showed that



<P>he was a lion of lordly characteristics by the air with which he spat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With Maggie gazing at him wonderingly, he took pride in commanding



<P>the waiters who were, however, indifferent or deaf.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hi, you, git a russle on yehs!&nbsp; What deh hell yehs lookin' at?



<P>Two more beehs, d'yeh hear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He leaned back and critically regarded the person of a girl



<P>with a straw-colored wig who upon the stage was flinging her heels



<P>in somewhat awkward imitation of a well-known danseuse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At times Maggie told Pete long confidential tales of her



<P>former home life, dwelling upon the escapades of the other members



<P>of the family and the difficulties she had to combat in order to



<P>obtain a degree of comfort.&nbsp; He responded in tones of philanthropy.



<P>He pressed her arm with an air of reassuring proprietorship.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dey was damn jays," he said, denouncing the mother and brother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sound of the music which, by the efforts of the frowsy-



<P>headed leader, drifted to her ears through the smoke-filled



<P>atmosphere, made the girl dream.&nbsp; She thought of her former



<P>Rum Alley environment and turned to regard Pete's strong protecting



<P>fists.&nbsp; She thought of the collar and cuff manufactory and the



<P>eternal moan of the proprietor: "What een hell do you sink I pie



<P>fife dolla a week for?&nbsp; Play?&nbsp; No, py damn."&nbsp; She contemplated



<P>Pete's man-subduing eyes and noted that wealth and prosperity was



<P>indicated by his clothes.&nbsp; She imagined a future, rose-tinted,



<P>because of its distance from all that she previously had experienced.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As to the present she perceived only vague reasons to be



<P>miserable.&nbsp; Her life was Pete's and she considered him worthy of



<P>the charge.&nbsp; She would be disturbed by no particular apprehensions,



<P>so long as Pete adored her as he now said he did.&nbsp; She did not

feel



<P>like a bad woman.&nbsp; To her knowledge she had never seen any better.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At times men at other tables regarded the girl furtively.



<P>Pete, aware of it, nodded at her and grinned.&nbsp; He felt proud.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mag, yer a bloomin' good-looker," he remarked, studying her



<P>face through the haze.&nbsp; The men made Maggie fear, but she blushed



<P>at Pete's words as it became apparent to her that she was the apple



<P>of his eye.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Grey-headed men, wonderfully pathetic in their dissipation,



<P>stared at her through clouds.&nbsp; Smooth-cheeked boys, some of them



<P>with faces of stone and mouths of sin, not nearly so pathetic as



<P>the grey heads, tried to find the girl's eyes in the smoke wreaths.



<P>Maggie considered she was not what they thought her.&nbsp; She confined



<P>her glances to Pete and the stage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The orchestra played negro melodies and a versatile drummer



<P>pounded, whacked, clattered and scratched on a dozen machines to



<P>make noise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Those glances of the men, shot at Maggie from under half-closed lids,



<P>made her tremble.&nbsp; She thought them all to be worse men than Pete.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come, let's go," she said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As they went out Maggie perceived two women seated at a table



<P>with some men.&nbsp; They were painted and their cheeks had lost their



<P>roundness.&nbsp; As she passed them the girl, with a shrinking movement,



<P>drew back her skirts.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The babe, Tommie, died.&nbsp; He went away in a white,



<P>insignificant coffin, his small waxen hand clutching a flower that



<P>the girl, Maggie, had stolen from an Italian.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She and Jimmie lived.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The inexperienced fibres of the boy's eyes were hardened at an



<P>early age.&nbsp; He became a young man of leather.&nbsp; He lived some

red



<P>years without laboring.&nbsp; During that time his sneer became chronic.



<P>He studied human nature in the gutter, and found it no worse than



<P>he thought he had reason to believe it.&nbsp; He never conceived a



<P>respect for the world, because he had begun with no idols that it



<P>had smashed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He clad his soul in armor by means of happening hilariously in



<P>at a mission church where a man composed his sermons of "yous."



<P>While they got warm at the stove, he told his hearers just where he



<P>calculated they stood with the Lord.&nbsp; Many of the sinners were



<P>impatient over the pictured depths of their degradation.&nbsp; They

were



<P>waiting for soup-tickets.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A reader of words of wind-demons might have been able to see



<P>the portions of a dialogue pass to and fro between the exhorter and



<P>his hearers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are damned," said the preacher.&nbsp; And the reader of sounds



<P>might have seen the reply go forth from the ragged people: "Where's



<P>our soup?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie and a companion sat in a rear seat and commented upon



<P>the things that didn't concern them, with all the freedom of



<P>English gentlemen.&nbsp; When they grew thirsty and went out their minds



<P>confused the speaker with Christ.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Momentarily, Jimmie was sullen with thoughts of a hopeless



<P>altitude where grew fruit.&nbsp; His companion said that if he



<P>should ever meet God he would ask for a million dollars and a



<P>bottle of beer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie's occupation for a long time was to stand on streetcorners



<P>and watch the world go by, dreaming blood-red dreams at the passing



<P>of pretty women.&nbsp; He menaced mankind at the intersections of streets.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the corners he was in life and of life.&nbsp; The world was



<P>going on and he was there to perceive it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He maintained a belligerent attitude toward all well-dressed



<P>men.&nbsp; To him fine raiment was allied to weakness, and all good



<P>coats covered faint hearts.&nbsp; He and his order were kings, to a



<P>certain extent, over the men of untarnished clothes, because these



<P>latter dreaded, perhaps, to be either killed or laughed at.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Above all things he despised obvious Christians and ciphers



<P>with the chrysanthemums of aristocracy in their button-holes.&nbsp;

He



<P>considered himself above both of these classes.&nbsp; He was afraid

of



<P>neither the devil nor the leader of society.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he had a dollar in his pocket his satisfaction with existence



<P>was the greatest thing in the world.&nbsp; So, eventually, he felt



<P>obliged to work.&nbsp; His father died and his mother's years were



<P>divided up into periods of thirty days.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He became a truck driver.&nbsp; He was given the charge of a painstaking



<P>pair of horses and a large rattling truck.&nbsp; He invaded the turmoil



<P>and tumble of the down-town streets and learned to breathe maledictory



<P>defiance at the police who occasionally used to climb up, drag him



<P>from his perch and beat him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the lower part of the city he daily involved himself in



<P>hideous tangles.&nbsp; If he and his team chanced to be in the rear

he



<P>preserved a demeanor of serenity, crossing his legs and bursting



<P>forth into yells when foot passengers took dangerous dives beneath



<P>the noses of his champing horses.&nbsp; He smoked his pipe calmly for

he



<P>knew that his pay was marching on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If in the front and the key-truck of chaos, he entered



<P>terrifically into the quarrel that was raging to and fro among the



<P>drivers on their high seats, and sometimes roared oaths and



<P>violently got himself arrested.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a time his sneer grew so that it turned its glare upon



<P>all things.&nbsp; He became so sharp that he believed in nothing.&nbsp;

To



<P>him the police were always actuated by malignant impulses and the



<P>rest of the world was composed, for the most part, of despicable



<P>creatures who were all trying to take advantage of him and with



<P>whom, in defense, he was obliged to quarrel on all possible



<P>occasions.&nbsp; He himself occupied a down-trodden position that



<P>had a private but distinct element of grandeur in its isolation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The most complete cases of aggravated idiocy were, to his mind,



<P>rampant upon the front platforms of all the street cars.&nbsp; At first



<P>his tongue strove with these beings, but he eventually was superior.



<P>He became immured like an African cow.&nbsp; In him grew a majestic

contempt



<P>for those strings of street cars that followed him like intent bugs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He fell into the habit, when starting on a long journey, of



<P>fixing his eye on a high and distant object, commanding his horses



<P>to begin, and then going into a sort of a trance of observation.



<P>Multitudes of drivers might howl in his rear, and passengers might



<P>load him with opprobrium, he would not awaken until some blue



<P>policeman turned red and began to frenziedly tear bridles and beat



<P>the soft noses of the responsible horses.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he paused to contemplate the attitude of the police



<P>toward himself and his fellows, he believed that they were the only



<P>men in the city who had no rights.&nbsp; When driving about, he felt



<P>that he was held liable by the police for anything that might occur



<P>in the streets, and was the common prey of all energetic officials.



<P>In revenge, he resolved never to move out of the way of anything,



<P>until formidable circumstances, or a much larger man than himself



<P>forced him to it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Foot-passengers were mere pestering flies with an insane



<P>disregard for their legs and his convenience.&nbsp; He could not



<P>conceive their maniacal desires to cross the streets.&nbsp; Their



<P>madness smote him with eternal amazement.&nbsp; He was continually



<P>storming at them from his throne.&nbsp; He sat aloft and denounced their



<P>frantic leaps, plunges, dives and straddles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When they would thrust at, or parry, the noses of his champing



<P>horses, making them swing their heads and move their feet,



<P>disturbing a solid dreamy repose, he swore at the men as fools,



<P>for he himself could perceive that Providence had caused it clearly



<P>to be written, that he and his team had the unalienable right to stand



<P>in the proper path of the sun chariot, and if they so minded,



<P>obstruct its mission or take a wheel off.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And, perhaps, if the god-driver had an ungovernable desire to



<P>step down, put up his flame-colored fists and manfully dispute the



<P>right of way, he would have probably been immediately opposed by a



<P>scowling mortal with two sets of very hard knuckles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It is possible, perhaps, that this young man would have



<P>derided, in an axle-wide alley, the approach of a flying ferry



<P>boat.&nbsp; Yet he achieved a respect for a fire engine.&nbsp; As one

charged



<P>toward his truck, he would drive fearfully upon a sidewalk,



<P>threatening untold people with annihilation.&nbsp; When an engine would



<P>strike a mass of blocked trucks, splitting it into fragments, as a



<P>blow annihilates a cake of ice, Jimmie's team could usually be



<P>observed high and safe, with whole wheels, on the sidewalk.



<P>The fearful coming of the engine could break up the most intricate



<P>muddle of heavy vehicles at which the police had been swearing for



<P>the half of an hour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A fire engine was enshrined in his heart as an appalling thing



<P>that he loved with a distant dog-like devotion.&nbsp; They had been



<P>known to overturn street-cars.&nbsp; Those leaping horses, striking



<P>sparks from the cobbles in their forward lunge, were creatures



<P>to be ineffably admired.&nbsp; The clang of the gong pierced his breast



<P>like a noise of remembered war.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Jimmie was a little boy, he began to be arrested.



<P>Before he reached a great age, he had a fair record.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He developed too great a tendency to climb down from his truck



<P>and fight with other drivers.&nbsp; He had been in quite a number of



<P>miscellaneous fights, and in some general barroom rows that had



<P>become known to the police.&nbsp; Once he had been arrested for



<P>assaulting a Chinaman.&nbsp; Two women in different parts of the city,



<P>and entirely unknown to each other, caused him considerable



<P>annoyance by breaking forth, simultaneously, at fateful intervals,



<P>into wailings about marriage and support and infants.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nevertheless, he had, on a certain star-lit evening, said wonderingly



<P>and quite reverently: "Deh moon looks like hell, don't it?"

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Jimmie had an idea it wasn't common courtesy for a friend to



<P>come to one's home and ruin one's sister.&nbsp; But he was not sure

how



<P>much Pete knew about the rules of politeness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The following night he returned home from work at rather a



<P>late hour in the evening.&nbsp; In passing through the halls he came



<P>upon the gnarled and leathery old woman who possessed the music



<P>box.&nbsp; She was grinning in the dim light that drifted through dust-



<P>stained panes.&nbsp; She beckoned to him with a smudged forefinger.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, Jimmie, what do yehs t'ink I got onto las' night.&nbsp; It was



<P>deh funnies' t'ing I ever saw," she cried, coming close to him and



<P>leering.&nbsp; She was trembling with eagerness to tell her tale.&nbsp;

"I



<P>was by me door las' night when yer sister and her jude feller came



<P>in late, oh, very late.&nbsp; An' she, the dear, she was a-cryin' as

if



<P>her heart would break, she was.&nbsp; It was deh funnies' t'ing I ever



<P>saw.&nbsp; An' right out here by me door she asked him did he love her,



<P>did he.&nbsp; An' she was a-cryin' as if her heart would break, poor



<P>t'ing.&nbsp; An' him, I could see by deh way what he said it dat she

had



<P>been askin' orften, he says: 'Oh, hell, yes,' he says, says he,



<P>'Oh, hell, yes.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Storm-clouds swept over Jimmie's face, but he turned from the



<P>leathery old woman and plodded on up-stairs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, hell, yes," called she after him.&nbsp; She laughed a laugh



<P>that was like a prophetic croak.&nbsp; "'Oh, hell, yes,' he says, says



<P>he, 'Oh, hell, yes.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was no one in at home.&nbsp; The rooms showed that attempts



<P>had been made at tidying them.&nbsp; Parts of the wreckage of the day



<P>before had been repaired by an unskilful hand.&nbsp; A chair or two

and



<P>the table, stood uncertainly upon legs.&nbsp; The floor had been newly



<P>swept.&nbsp; Too, the blue ribbons had been restored to the curtains,



<P>and the lambrequin, with its immense sheaves of yellow wheat



<P>and red roses of equal size, had been returned, in a worn and sorry



<P>state, to its position at the mantel.&nbsp; Maggie's jacket and hat

were



<P>gone from the nail behind the door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie walked to the window and began to look through the



<P>blurred glass.&nbsp; It occurred to him to vaguely wonder, for an



<P>instant, if some of the women of his acquaintance had brothers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Suddenly, however, he began to swear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But he was me frien'!&nbsp; I brought 'im here!&nbsp; Dat's deh hell

of it!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He fumed about the room, his anger gradually rising to the



<P>furious pitch.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll kill deh jay!&nbsp; Dat's what I'll do!&nbsp; I'll kill deh jay!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He clutched his hat and sprang toward the door.&nbsp; But it opened



<P>and his mother's great form blocked the passage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What deh hell's deh matter wid yeh?" exclaimed she, coming



<P>into the rooms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie gave vent to a sardonic curse and then laughed heavily.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Maggie's gone teh deh devil!&nbsp; Dat's what!&nbsp; See?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Eh?" said his mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Maggie's gone teh deh devil!&nbsp; Are yehs deaf?" roared Jimmie,



<P>impatiently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Deh hell she has," murmured the mother, astounded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie grunted, and then began to stare out at the window.



<P>His mother sat down in a chair, but a moment later sprang erect and



<P>delivered a maddened whirl of oaths.&nbsp; Her son turned to look at

her



<P>as she reeled and swayed in the middle of the room, her fierce face



<P>convulsed with passion, her blotched arms raised high in imprecation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"May Gawd curse her forever," she shrieked.&nbsp; "May she eat



<P>nothin' but stones and deh dirt in deh street.&nbsp; May she sleep in



<P>deh gutter an' never see deh sun shine agin.&nbsp; Deh damn--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here, now," said her son.&nbsp; "Take a drop on yourself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mother raised lamenting eyes to the ceiling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She's deh devil's own chil', Jimmie," she whispered.&nbsp; "Ah,



<P>who would t'ink such a bad girl could grow up in our fambly,



<P>Jimmie, me son.&nbsp; Many deh hour I've spent in talk wid dat girl

an'



<P>tol' her if she ever went on deh streets I'd see her damned.&nbsp; An'



<P>after all her bringin' up an' what I tol' her and talked wid her,



<P>she goes teh deh bad, like a duck teh water."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tears rolled down her furrowed face.&nbsp; Her hands trembled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"An' den when dat Sadie MacMallister next door to us was sent



<P>teh deh devil by dat feller what worked in deh soap-factory,



<P>didn't I tell our Mag dat if she--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, dat's annuder story," interrupted the brother.&nbsp; "Of



<P>course, dat Sadie was nice an' all dat--but--see--it ain't dessame



<P>as if--well, Maggie was diff'ent--see--she was diff'ent."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was trying to formulate a theory that he had always



<P>unconsciously held, that all sisters, excepting his own, could



<P>advisedly be ruined.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He suddenly broke out again.&nbsp; "I'll go t'ump hell outa deh mug



<P>what did her deh harm.&nbsp; I'll kill 'im!&nbsp; He t'inks he kin scrap,



<P>but when he gits me a-chasin' 'im he'll fin' out where he's wrong,



<P>deh damned duffer.&nbsp; I'll wipe up deh street wid 'im."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a fury he plunged out of the doorway.&nbsp; As he vanished the



<P>mother raised her head and lifted both hands, entreating.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"May Gawd curse her forever," she cried.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the darkness of the hallway Jimmie discerned a knot of women



<P>talking volubly.&nbsp; When he strode by they paid no attention to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She allus was a bold thing," he heard one of them cry in an



<P>eager voice.&nbsp; "Dere wasn't a feller come teh deh house but she'd



<P>try teh mash 'im.&nbsp; My Annie says deh shameless t'ing tried teh



<P>ketch her feller, her own feller, what we useter know his fader."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I could a' tol' yehs dis two years ago," said a woman, in a



<P>key of triumph.&nbsp; "Yessir, it was over two years ago dat I says



<P>teh my ol' man, I says, 'Dat Johnson girl ain't straight,' I says.



<P>'Oh, hell,' he says.&nbsp; 'Oh, hell.'&nbsp; 'Dat's all right,' I says,



<P>'but I know what I knows,' I says, 'an' it 'ill come out later.



<P>You wait an' see,' I says, 'you see.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Anybody what had eyes could see dat dere was somethin' wrong



<P>wid dat girl.&nbsp; I didn't like her actions."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the street Jimmie met a friend.&nbsp; "What deh hell?" asked the



<P>latter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie explained.&nbsp; "An' I'll t'ump 'im till he can't stand."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, what deh hell," said the friend.&nbsp; "What's deh use!



<P>Yeh'll git pulled in!&nbsp; Everybody 'ill be onto it!&nbsp; An' ten

plunks!



<P>Gee!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie was determined.&nbsp; "He t'inks he kin scrap, but he'll



<P>fin' out diff'ent."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gee," remonstrated the friend.&nbsp; "What deh hell?"

<P>On a corner a glass-fronted building shed a yellow glare upon



<P>the pavements.&nbsp; The open mouth of a saloon called seductively to



<P>passengers to enter and annihilate sorrow or create rage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The interior of the place was papered in olive and bronze tints



<P>of imitation leather.&nbsp; A shining bar of counterfeit massiveness



<P>extended down the side of the room.&nbsp; Behind it a great



<P>mahogany-appearing sideboard reached the ceiling.&nbsp; Upon its



<P>shelves rested pyramids of shimmering glasses that were never



<P>disturbed.&nbsp; Mirrors set in the face of the sideboard multiplied



<P>them.&nbsp; Lemons, oranges and paper napkins, arranged with



<P>mathematical precision, sat among the glasses.&nbsp; Many-hued decanters



<P>of liquor perched at regular intervals on the lower shelves.



<P>A nickel-plated cash register occupied a position in the exact



<P>centre of the general effect.&nbsp; The elementary senses of it all



<P>seemed to be opulence and geometrical accuracy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Across from the bar a smaller counter held a collection of plates



<P>upon which swarmed frayed fragments of crackers, slices of boiled ham,



<P>dishevelled bits of cheese, and pickles swimming in vinegar.



<P>An odor of grasping, begrimed hands and munching mouths pervaded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pete, in a white jacket, was behind the bar bending



<P>expectantly toward a quiet stranger.&nbsp; "A beeh," said the man.



<P>Pete drew a foam-topped glassful and set it dripping upon the bar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At this moment the light bamboo doors at the entrance swung



<P>open and crashed against the siding.&nbsp; Jimmie and a companion



<P>entered.&nbsp; They swaggered unsteadily but belligerently toward the



<P>bar and looked at Pete with bleared and blinking eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gin," said Jimmie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gin," said the companion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pete slid a bottle and two glasses along the bar.&nbsp; He bended



<P>his head sideways as he assiduously polished away with a napkin at



<P>the gleaming wood.&nbsp; He had a look of watchfulness upon his



<P>features.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie and his companion kept their eyes upon the bartender



<P>and conversed loudly in tones of contempt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He's a dindy masher, ain't he, by Gawd?" laughed Jimmie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, hell, yes," said the companion, sneering widely.&nbsp; "He's



<P>great, he is.&nbsp; Git onto deh mug on deh blokie.&nbsp; Dat's enough

to



<P>make a feller turn hand-springs in 'is sleep."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The quiet stranger moved himself and his glass a trifle



<P>further away and maintained an attitude of oblivion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gee! ain't he hot stuff!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Git onto his shape!&nbsp; Great Gawd!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hey," cried Jimmie, in tones of command.&nbsp; Pete came along



<P>slowly, with a sullen dropping of the under lip.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," he growled, "what's eatin' yehs?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gin," said Jimmie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gin," said the companion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Pete confronted them with the bottle and the glasses, they



<P>laughed in his face.&nbsp; Jimmie's companion, evidently overcome with



<P>merriment, pointed a grimy forefinger in Pete's direction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Say, Jimmie," demanded he, "what deh hell is dat behind deh



<P>bar?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Damned if I knows," replied Jimmie.&nbsp; They laughed loudly.



<P>Pete put down a bottle with a bang and turned a formidable face



<P>toward them.&nbsp; He disclosed his teeth and his shoulders heaved



<P>restlessly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You fellers can't guy me," he said.&nbsp; "Drink yer stuff an' git



<P>out an' don' make no trouble."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Instantly the laughter faded from the faces of the two men and



<P>expressions of offended dignity immediately came.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who deh hell has said anyt'ing teh you," cried they in the



<P>same breath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The quiet stranger looked at the door calculatingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, come off," said Pete to the two men.&nbsp; "Don't pick me up



<P>for no jay.&nbsp; Drink yer rum an' git out an' don' make no trouble."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, deh hell," airily cried Jimmie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, deh hell," airily repeated his companion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We goes when we git ready!&nbsp; See!" continued Jimmie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said Pete in a threatening voice, "don' make no



<P>trouble."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie suddenly leaned forward with his head on one side.



<P>He snarled like a wild animal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, what if we does?&nbsp; See?" said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dark blood flushed into Pete's face, and he shot a lurid



<P>glance at Jimmie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, den we'll see whose deh bes' man, you or me," he said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The quiet stranger moved modestly toward the door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie began to swell with valor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don' pick me up fer no tenderfoot.&nbsp; When yeh tackles me yeh



<P>tackles one of deh bes' men in deh city.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; I'm a scrapper,



<P>I am.&nbsp; Ain't dat right, Billie?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sure, Mike," responded his companion in tones of conviction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, hell," said Pete, easily.&nbsp; "Go fall on yerself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The two men again began to laugh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What deh hell is dat talkin'?" cried the companion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Damned if I knows," replied Jimmie with exaggerated contempt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pete made a furious gesture.&nbsp; "Git outa here now, an' don' make



<P>no trouble.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; Youse fellers er lookin' fer a scrap an'

it's



<P>damn likely yeh'll fin' one if yeh keeps on shootin' off yer mout's.



<P>I know yehs!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; I kin lick better men dan yehs ever saw

in yer lifes.



<P>Dat's right!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; Don' pick me up fer no stuff er yeh might

be jolted



<P>out in deh street before yeh knows where yeh is.&nbsp; When I comes

from behind



<P>dis bar, I t'rows yehs bote inteh deh street.&nbsp; See?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, hell," cried the two men in chorus.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The glare of a panther came into Pete's eyes.&nbsp; "Dat's what I said!



<P>Unnerstan'?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He came through a passage at the end of the bar and swelled down upon



<P>the two men.&nbsp; They stepped promptly forward and crowded close to

him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They bristled like three roosters.&nbsp; They moved their heads



<P>pugnaciously and kept their shoulders braced.&nbsp; The nervous muscles



<P>about each mouth twitched with a forced smile of mockery.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, what deh hell yer goin' teh do?" gritted Jimmie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pete stepped warily back, waving his hands before him to keep



<P>the men from coming too near.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, what deh hell yer goin' teh do?" repeated Jimmie's ally.



<P>They kept close to him, taunting and leering.&nbsp; They strove



<P>to make him attempt the initial blow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Keep back, now!&nbsp; Don' crowd me," ominously said Pete.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Again they chorused in contempt.&nbsp; "Oh, hell!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a small, tossing group, the three men edged for positions



<P>like frigates contemplating battle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, why deh hell don' yeh try teh t'row us out?" cried Jimmie



<P>and his ally with copious sneers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The bravery of bull-dogs sat upon the faces of the men.



<P>Their clenched fists moved like eager weapons.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The allied two jostled the bartender's elbows, glaring at him



<P>with feverish eyes and forcing him toward the wall.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Suddenly Pete swore redly.&nbsp; The flash of action gleamed from



<P>his eyes.&nbsp; He threw back his arm and aimed a tremendous, lightning-



<P>like blow at Jimmie's face.&nbsp; His foot swung a step forward and

the



<P>weight of his body was behind his fist.&nbsp; Jimmie ducked his head,



<P>Bowery-like, with the quickness of a cat.&nbsp; The fierce, answering



<P>blows of him and his ally crushed on Pete's bowed head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The quiet stranger vanished.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The arms of the combatants whirled in the air like flails.



<P>The faces of the men, at first flushed to flame-colored anger, now



<P>began to fade to the pallor of warriors in the blood and heat of a



<P>battle.&nbsp; Their lips curled back and stretched tightly over the

gums



<P>in ghoul-like grins.&nbsp; Through their white, gripped teeth struggled



<P>hoarse whisperings of oaths.&nbsp; Their eyes glittered with murderous

fire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Each head was huddled between its owner's shoulders, and arms



<P>were swinging with marvelous rapidity.&nbsp; Feet scraped to and fro



<P>with a loud scratching sound upon the sanded floor.&nbsp; Blows left



<P>crimson blotches upon pale skin.&nbsp; The curses of the first quarter



<P>minute of the fight died away.&nbsp; The breaths of the fighters came



<P>wheezingly from their lips and the three chests were straining and



<P>heaving.&nbsp; Pete at intervals gave vent to low, labored hisses, that



<P>sounded like a desire to kill.&nbsp; Jimmie's ally gibbered at times

like



<P>a wounded maniac.&nbsp; Jimmie was silent, fighting with the face



<P>of a sacrificial priest.&nbsp; The rage of fear shone in all their



<P>eyes and their blood-colored fists swirled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At a tottering moment a blow from Pete's hand struck the ally



<P>and he crashed to the floor.&nbsp; He wriggled instantly to his feet

and



<P>grasping the quiet stranger's beer glass from the bar, hurled it at



<P>Pete's head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>High on the wall it burst like a bomb, shivering fragments



<P>flying in all directions.&nbsp; Then missiles came to every man's hand.



<P>The place had heretofore appeared free of things to throw, but



<P>suddenly glass and bottles went singing through the air.&nbsp; They

were



<P>thrown point blank at bobbing heads.&nbsp; The pyramid of shimmering



<P>glasses, that had never been disturbed, changed to cascades as



<P>heavy bottles were flung into them.&nbsp; Mirrors splintered to nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The three frothing creatures on the floor buried themselves in



<P>a frenzy for blood.&nbsp; There followed in the wake of missiles and



<P>fists some unknown prayers, perhaps for death.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The quiet stranger had sprawled very pyrotechnically out on



<P>the sidewalk.&nbsp; A laugh ran up and down the avenue for the half



<P>of a block.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dey've trowed a bloke inteh deh street."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>People heard the sound of breaking glass and shuffling feet



<P>within the saloon and came running.&nbsp; A small group, bending down

to



<P>look under the bamboo doors, watching the fall of glass, and three



<P>pairs of violent legs, changed in a moment to a crowd.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A policeman came charging down the sidewalk and bounced



<P>through the doors into the saloon.&nbsp; The crowd bended and surged

in



<P>absorbing anxiety to see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie caught first sight of the on-coming interruption.&nbsp; On his

feet



<P>he had the same regard for a policeman that, when on his truck,



<P>he had for a fire engine.&nbsp; He howled and ran for the side door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The officer made a terrific advance, club in hand.&nbsp; One comprehensive



<P>sweep of the long night stick threw the ally to the floor and forced



<P>Pete to a corner.&nbsp; With his disengaged hand he made a furious effort



<P>at Jimmie's coat-tails.&nbsp; Then he regained his balance and paused.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, well, you are a pair of pictures.&nbsp; What in hell yeh



<P>been up to?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie, with his face drenched in blood, escaped up a side street,



<P>pursued a short distance by some of the more law-loving, or excited



<P>individuals of the crowd.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Later, from a corner safely dark, he saw the policeman, the



<P>ally and the bartender emerge from the saloon.&nbsp; Pete locked the



<P>doors and then followed up the avenue in the rear of the crowd-



<P>encompassed policeman and his charge.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On first thoughts Jimmie, with his heart throbbing at battle heat,



<P>started to go desperately to the rescue of his friend, but he halted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, what deh hell?" he demanded of himself.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girl, Maggie, blossomed in a mud puddle.&nbsp; She grew to be



<P>a most rare and wonderful production of a tenement district,



<P>a pretty girl.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>None of the dirt of Rum Alley seemed to be in her veins.



<P>The philosophers up-stairs, down-stairs and on the same floor,



<P>puzzled over it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When a child, playing and fighting with gamins in the street,



<P>dirt disguised her.&nbsp; Attired in tatters and grime, she went unseen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There came a time, however, when the young men of the vicinity



<P>said: "Dat Johnson goil is a puty good looker."&nbsp; About this period



<P>her brother remarked to her: "Mag, I'll tell yeh dis!&nbsp; See?



<P>Yeh've edder got teh go teh hell or go teh work!"&nbsp; Whereupon she



<P>went to work, having the feminine aversion of going to hell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By a chance, she got a position in an establishment where they



<P>made collars and cuffs.&nbsp; She received a stool and a machine in

a



<P>room where sat twenty girls of various shades of yellow discontent.



<P>She perched on the stool and treadled at her machine all day,



<P>turning out collars, the name of whose brand could be noted for its



<P>irrelevancy to anything in connection with collars.&nbsp; At night she



<P>returned home to her mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie grew large enough to take the vague position of head of



<P>the family.&nbsp; As incumbent of that office, he stumbled up-stairs



<P>late at night, as his father had done before him.&nbsp; He reeled about



<P>the room, swearing at his relations, or went to sleep on the floor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mother had gradually arisen to that degree of fame that



<P>she could bandy words with her acquaintances among the police-



<P>justices.&nbsp; Court-officials called her by her first name.&nbsp;

When she



<P>appeared they pursued a course which had been theirs for months.



<P>They invariably grinned and cried out: "Hello, Mary, you here



<P>again?"&nbsp; Her grey head wagged in many a court.&nbsp; She always

besieged



<P>the bench with voluble excuses, explanations, apologies and



<P>prayers.&nbsp; Her flaming face and rolling eyes were a sort of familiar



<P>sight on the island.&nbsp; She measured time by means of sprees, and

was



<P>eternally swollen and dishevelled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One day the young man, Pete, who as a lad had smitten the



<P>Devil's Row urchin in the back of the head and put to flight the



<P>antagonists of his friend, Jimmie, strutted upon the scene.



<P>He met Jimmie one day on the street, promised to take him to



<P>a boxing match in Williamsburg, and called for him in the evening.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie observed Pete.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He sat on a table in the Johnson home and dangled his checked



<P>legs with an enticing nonchalance.&nbsp; His hair was curled down over



<P>his forehead in an oiled bang.&nbsp; His rather pugged nose seemed to



<P>revolt from contact with a bristling moustache of short, wire-like



<P>hairs.&nbsp; His blue double-breasted coat, edged with black braid,



<P>buttoned close to a red puff tie, and his patent-leather shoes



<P>looked like murder-fitted weapons.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His mannerisms stamped him as a man who had a correct sense of



<P>his personal superiority.&nbsp; There was valor and contempt for



<P>circumstances in the glance of his eye.&nbsp; He waved his hands like

a



<P>man of the world, who dismisses religion and philosophy, and says



<P>"Fudge."&nbsp; He had certainly seen everything and with each curl of



<P>his lip, he declared that it amounted to nothing.&nbsp; Maggie



<P>thought he must be a very elegant and graceful bartender.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was telling tales to Jimmie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie watched him furtively, with half-closed eyes, lit with



<P>a vague interest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hully gee!&nbsp; Dey makes me tired," he said.&nbsp; "Mos' e'ry day



<P>some farmer comes in an' tries teh run deh shop.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; But

dey



<P>gits t'rowed right out!&nbsp; I jolt dem right out in deh street before



<P>dey knows where dey is!&nbsp; See?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sure," said Jimmie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dere was a mug come in deh place deh odder day wid an idear



<P>he wus goin' teh own deh place!&nbsp; Hully gee, he wus goin' teh own



<P>deh place!&nbsp; I see he had a still on an' I didn' wanna giv 'im no



<P>stuff, so I says: 'Git deh hell outa here an' don' make no



<P>trouble,' I says like dat!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; 'Git deh hell outa here

an' don'



<P>make no trouble'; like dat.&nbsp; 'Git deh hell outa here,' I says.&nbsp;

See?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie nodded understandingly.&nbsp; Over his features played an



<P>eager desire to state the amount of his valor in a similar crisis,



<P>but the narrator proceeded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, deh blokie he says: 'T'hell wid it!&nbsp; I ain' lookin' for



<P>no scrap,' he says (See?), 'but' he says, 'I'm 'spectable cit'zen



<P>an' I wanna drink an' purtydamnsoon, too.'&nbsp; See?&nbsp; 'Deh hell,'

I



<P>says.&nbsp; Like dat!&nbsp; 'Deh hell,' I says.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; 'Don'

make no



<P>trouble,' I says.&nbsp; Like dat.&nbsp; 'Don' make no trouble.'&nbsp;

See?&nbsp; Den



<P>deh mug he squared off an' said he was fine as silk wid his dukes



<P>(See?) an' he wanned a drink damnquick.&nbsp; Dat's what he said.&nbsp;

See?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sure," repeated Jimmie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pete continued.&nbsp; "Say, I jes' jumped deh bar an' deh way I



<P>plunked dat blokie was great.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; Dat's right!&nbsp; In

deh jaw!



<P>See?&nbsp; Hully gee, he t'rowed a spittoon true deh front windee.&nbsp;

Say,



<P>I taut I'd drop dead.&nbsp; But deh boss, he comes in after an' he says,



<P>'Pete, yehs done jes' right!&nbsp; Yeh've gota keep order an' it's all



<P>right.'&nbsp; See?&nbsp; 'It's all right,' he says.&nbsp; Dat's what

he said."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The two held a technical discussion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dat bloke was a dandy," said Pete, in conclusion, "but he



<P>hadn' oughta made no trouble.&nbsp; Dat's what I says teh dem: 'Don'



<P>come in here an' make no trouble,' I says, like dat.&nbsp; 'Don' make

no



<P>trouble.'&nbsp; See?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Jimmie and his friend exchanged tales descriptive of their



<P>prowess, Maggie leaned back in the shadow.&nbsp; Her eyes dwelt



<P>wonderingly and rather wistfully upon Pete's face.&nbsp; The broken



<P>furniture, grimey walls, and general disorder and dirt of her home



<P>of a sudden appeared before her and began to take a



<P>potential aspect.&nbsp; Pete's aristocratic person looked as if it might



<P>soil.&nbsp; She looked keenly at him, occasionally, wondering if he

was



<P>feeling contempt.&nbsp; But Pete seemed to be enveloped in reminiscence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hully gee," said he, "dose mugs can't phase me.&nbsp; Dey knows I



<P>kin wipe up deh street wid any t'ree of dem."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he said, "Ah, what deh hell," his voice was burdened with



<P>disdain for the inevitable and contempt for anything that fate



<P>might compel him to endure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie perceived that here was the beau ideal of a man.&nbsp; Her



<P>dim thoughts were often searching for far away lands where, as God



<P>says, the little hills sing together in the morning.&nbsp; Under the



<P>trees of her dream-gardens there had always walked a lover.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A very little boy stood upon a heap of gravel for the honor of



<P>Rum Alley.&nbsp; He was throwing stones at howling urchins from Devil's



<P>Row who were circling madly about the heap and pelting at him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His infantile countenance was livid with fury.&nbsp; His small body



<P>was writhing in the delivery of great, crimson oaths.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Run, Jimmie, run!&nbsp; Dey'll get yehs," screamed a retreating



<P>Rum Alley child.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Naw," responded Jimmie with a valiant roar, "dese micks can't



<P>make me run."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Howls of renewed wrath went up from Devil's Row throats.



<P>Tattered gamins on the right made a furious assault on the gravel



<P>heap.&nbsp; On their small, convulsed faces there shone the grins of



<P>true assassins.&nbsp; As they charged, they threw stones and cursed

in



<P>shrill chorus.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The little champion of Rum Alley stumbled precipitately down



<P>the other side.&nbsp; His coat had been torn to shreds in a scuffle,

and



<P>his hat was gone.&nbsp; He had bruises on twenty parts of his body,

and



<P>blood was dripping from a cut in his head.&nbsp; His wan features wore



<P>a look of a tiny, insane demon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the ground, children from Devil's Row closed in on their



<P>antagonist.&nbsp; He crooked his left arm defensively about his head

and



<P>fought with cursing fury.&nbsp; The little boys ran to and fro, dodging,



<P>hurling stones and swearing in barbaric trebles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From a window of an apartment house that upreared its form



<P>from amid squat, ignorant stables, there leaned a curious woman.



<P>Some laborers, unloading a scow at a dock at the river, paused for



<P>a moment and regarded the fight.&nbsp; The engineer of a passive tugboat



<P>hung lazily to a railing and watched.&nbsp; Over on the Island, a worm



<P>building and crawled slowly along the river's bank.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A stone had smashed into Jimmie's mouth.&nbsp; Blood was bubbling



<P>over his chin and down upon his ragged shirt.&nbsp; Tears made furrows



<P>on his dirt-stained cheeks.&nbsp; His thin legs had begun to tremble

and



<P>turn weak, causing his small body to reel.&nbsp; His roaring curses

of



<P>the first part of the fight had changed to a blasphemous chatter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the yells of the whirling mob of Devil's Row children



<P>there were notes of joy like songs of triumphant savagery.



<P>The little boys seemed to leer gloatingly at the blood upon



<P>the other child's face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Down the avenue came boastfully sauntering a lad of sixteen



<P>years, although the chronic sneer of an ideal manhood already sat



<P>upon his lips.&nbsp; His hat was tipped with an air of challenge over



<P>his eye.&nbsp; Between his teeth, a cigar stump was tilted at the angle



<P>of defiance.&nbsp; He walked with a certain swing of the shoulders which



<P>appalled the timid.&nbsp; He glanced over into the vacant lot in which



<P>the little raving boys from Devil's Row seethed about the shrieking



<P>and tearful child from Rum Alley.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gee!" he murmured with interest.&nbsp; "A scrap.&nbsp; Gee!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He strode over to the cursing circle, swinging his shoulders



<P>in a manner which denoted that he held victory in his fists.



<P>He approached at the back of one of the most deeply engaged



<P>of the Devil's Row children.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, what deh hell," he said, and smote the deeply-engaged one



<P>on the back of the head.&nbsp; The little boy fell to the ground and



<P>gave a hoarse, tremendous howl.&nbsp; He scrambled to his feet, and



<P>perceiving, evidently, the size of his assailant, ran quickly off,



<P>shouting alarms.&nbsp; The entire Devil's Row party followed him.&nbsp;

They



<P>came to a stand a short distance away and yelled taunting oaths at



<P>the boy with the chronic sneer.&nbsp; The latter, momentarily, paid

no



<P>attention to them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What deh hell, Jimmie?" he asked of the small champion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie wiped his blood-wet features with his sleeve.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, it was dis way, Pete, see!&nbsp; I was goin' teh lick dat



<P>Riley kid and dey all pitched on me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Some Rum Alley children now came forward.&nbsp; The party stood for



<P>a moment exchanging vainglorious remarks with Devil's Row.&nbsp; A few



<P>stones were thrown at long distances, and words of challenge passed



<P>between small warriors.&nbsp; Then the Rum Alley contingent turned



<P>slowly in the direction of their home street.&nbsp; They began to give,



<P>each to each, distorted versions of the fight.&nbsp; Causes of retreat



<P>in particular cases were magnified.&nbsp; Blows dealt in the fight were



<P>enlarged to catapultian power, and stones thrown were alleged to



<P>have hurtled with infinite accuracy.&nbsp; Valor grew strong again,



<P>and the little boys began to swear with great spirit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, we blokies kin lick deh hull damn Row," said a child, swaggering.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Little Jimmie was striving to stanch the flow of blood from



<P>his cut lips.&nbsp; Scowling, he turned upon the speaker.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, where deh hell was yeh when I was doin' all deh fightin?"



<P>he demanded.&nbsp; "Youse kids makes me tired."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, go ahn," replied the other argumentatively.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie replied with heavy contempt.&nbsp; "Ah, youse can't fight,



<P>Blue Billie!&nbsp; I kin lick yeh wid one han'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, go ahn," replied Billie again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah," said Jimmie threateningly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah," said the other in the same tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They struck at each other, clinched, and rolled over on the



<P>cobble stones.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Smash 'im, Jimmie, kick deh damn guts out of 'im," yelled Pete,



<P>the lad with the chronic sneer, in tones of delight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The small combatants pounded and kicked, scratched and tore.



<P>They began to weep and their curses struggled in their throats with



<P>sobs.&nbsp; The other little boys clasped their hands and wriggled their



<P>legs in excitement.&nbsp; They formed a bobbing circle about the pair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A tiny spectator was suddenly agitated.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Cheese it, Jimmie, cheese it!&nbsp; Here comes yer fader," he yelled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The circle of little boys instantly parted.&nbsp; They drew away



<P>and waited in ecstatic awe for that which was about to happen.



<P>The two little boys fighting in the modes of four thousand years ago,



<P>did not hear the warning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Up the avenue there plodded slowly a man with sullen eyes.



<P>He was carrying a dinner pail and smoking an apple-wood pipe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he neared the spot where the little boys strove, he



<P>regarded them listlessly.&nbsp; But suddenly he roared an oath and



<P>advanced upon the rolling fighters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here, you Jim, git up, now, while I belt yer life out,



<P>you damned disorderly brat."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He began to kick into the chaotic mass on the ground.&nbsp; The boy



<P>Billie felt a heavy boot strike his head.&nbsp; He made a furious effort



<P>and disentangled himself from Jimmie.&nbsp; He tottered away, damning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie arose painfully from the ground and confronting his



<P>father, began to curse him.&nbsp; His parent kicked him.&nbsp; "Come

home,



<P>now," he cried, "an' stop yer jawin', er I'll lam the everlasting



<P>head off yehs."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They departed.&nbsp; The man paced placidly along with the apple-



<P>wood emblem of serenity between his teeth.&nbsp; The boy followed a



<P>dozen feet in the rear.&nbsp; He swore luridly, for he felt that it

was



<P>degradation for one who aimed to be some vague soldier, or a man of



<P>blood with a sort of sublime license, to be taken home by a father.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>A forlorn woman went along a lighted avenue.&nbsp; The street was



<P>filled with people desperately bound on missions.&nbsp; An endless crowd



<P>darted at the elevated station stairs and the horse cars were



<P>thronged with owners of bundles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The pace of the forlorn woman was slow.&nbsp; She was apparently



<P>searching for some one.&nbsp; She loitered near the doors of saloons

and



<P>watched men emerge from them.&nbsp; She scanned furtively the faces

in



<P>the rushing stream of pedestrians.&nbsp; Hurrying men, bent on catching



<P>some boat or train, jostled her elbows, failing to notice her,



<P>their thoughts fixed on distant dinners.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The forlorn woman had a peculiar face.&nbsp; Her smile was no



<P>smile.&nbsp; But when in repose her features had a shadowy look that

was



<P>like a sardonic grin, as if some one had sketched with cruel



<P>forefinger indelible lines about her mouth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie came strolling up the avenue.&nbsp; The woman encountered



<P>him with an aggrieved air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Jimmie, I've been lookin' all over fer yehs--," she began.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie made an impatient gesture and quickened his pace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, don't bodder me!&nbsp; Good Gawd!" he said, with the



<P>savageness of a man whose life is pestered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman followed him along the sidewalk in somewhat the



<P>manner of a suppliant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, Jimmie," she said, "yehs told me ye'd--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie turned upon her fiercely as if resolved to make a last



<P>stand for comfort and peace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Say, fer Gawd's sake, Hattie, don' foller me from one end of



<P>deh city teh deh odder.&nbsp; Let up, will yehs!&nbsp; Give me a minute's



<P>res', can't yehs?&nbsp; Yehs makes me tired, allus taggin' me.&nbsp;

See?



<P>Ain' yehs got no sense.&nbsp; Do yehs want people teh get onto me?



<P>Go chase yerself, fer Gawd's sake."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman stepped closer and laid her fingers on his arm.



<P>"But, look-a-here--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie snarled.&nbsp; "Oh, go teh hell."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He darted into the front door of a convenient saloon and a



<P>moment later came out into the shadows that surrounded the side



<P>door.&nbsp; On the brilliantly lighted avenue he perceived the forlorn



<P>woman dodging about like a scout.&nbsp; Jimmie laughed with an air of



<P>relief and went away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he arrived home he found his mother clamoring.



<P>Maggie had returned.&nbsp; She stood shivering beneath the torrent



<P>of her mother's wrath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I'm damned," said Jimmie in greeting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His mother, tottering about the room, pointed a quivering



<P>forefinger.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Lookut her, Jimmie, lookut her.&nbsp; Dere's yer sister, boy.



<P>Dere's yer sister.&nbsp; Lookut her!&nbsp; Lookut her!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She screamed in scoffing laughter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girl stood in the middle of the room.&nbsp; She edged about as



<P>if unable to find a place on the floor to put her feet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ha, ha, ha," bellowed the mother.&nbsp; "Dere she stands!&nbsp; Ain'



<P>she purty?&nbsp; Lookut her!&nbsp; Ain' she sweet, deh beast?&nbsp;

Lookut her!



<P>Ha, ha, lookut her!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She lurched forward and put her red and seamed hands upon her



<P>daughter's face.&nbsp; She bent down and peered keenly up into the eyes



<P>of the girl.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, she's jes' dessame as she ever was, ain' she?&nbsp; She's her



<P>mudder's purty darlin' yit, ain' she?&nbsp; Lookut her, Jimmie!&nbsp;

Come



<P>here, fer Gawd's sake, and lookut her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The loud, tremendous sneering of the mother brought the



<P>denizens of the Rum Alley tenement to their doors.&nbsp; Women came

in



<P>the hallways.&nbsp; Children scurried to and fro.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What's up?&nbsp; Dat Johnson party on anudder tear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Naw!&nbsp; Young Mag's come home!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Deh hell yeh say?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Through the open door curious eyes stared in at Maggie.



<P>Children ventured into the room and ogled her, as if they formed



<P>the front row at a theatre.&nbsp; Women, without, bended toward each



<P>other and whispered, nodding their heads with airs of profound



<P>philosophy.&nbsp; A baby, overcome with curiosity concerning this object



<P>at which all were looking, sidled forward and touched her dress,



<P>cautiously, as if investigating a red-hot stove.&nbsp; Its mother's



<P>voice rang out like a warning trumpet.&nbsp; She rushed forward and



<P>grabbed her child, casting a terrible look of indignation at the girl.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie's mother paced to and fro, addressing the doorful of



<P>eyes, expounding like a glib showman at a museum.&nbsp; Her voice rang



<P>through the building.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dere she stands," she cried, wheeling suddenly and pointing



<P>with dramatic finger.&nbsp; "Dere she stands!&nbsp; Lookut her!&nbsp;

Ain' she a



<P>dindy?&nbsp; An' she was so good as to come home teh her mudder, she



<P>was!&nbsp; Ain' she a beaut'?&nbsp; Ain' she a dindy?&nbsp; Fer Gawd's

sake!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The jeering cries ended in another burst of shrill laughter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girl seemed to awaken.&nbsp; "Jimmie--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He drew hastily back from her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, now, yer a hell of a t'ing, ain' yeh?" he said, his



<P>lips curling in scorn.&nbsp; Radiant virtue sat upon his brow and his



<P>repelling hands expressed horror of contamination.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie turned and went.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The crowd at the door fell back precipitately.&nbsp; A baby falling



<P>down in front of the door, wrenched a scream like a wounded animal



<P>from its mother.&nbsp; Another woman sprang forward and picked it up,



<P>with a chivalrous air, as if rescuing a human being from an



<P>oncoming express train.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the girl passed down through the hall, she went before open



<P>doors framing more eyes strangely microscopic, and sending broad



<P>beams of inquisitive light into the darkness of her path.&nbsp; On the



<P>second floor she met the gnarled old woman who possessed the music box.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So," she cried, "'ere yehs are back again, are yehs?&nbsp; An'



<P>dey've kicked yehs out?&nbsp; Well, come in an' stay wid me teh-night.



<P>I ain' got no moral standin'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From above came an unceasing babble of tongues, over all of



<P>which rang the mother's derisive laughter.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>In a hilarious hall there were twenty-eight tables and twenty-



<P>eight women and a crowd of smoking men.&nbsp; Valiant noise was made

on



<P>a stage at the end of the hall by an orchestra composed of men who



<P>looked as if they had just happened in.&nbsp; Soiled waiters ran to

and



<P>fro, swooping down like hawks on the unwary in the throng;



<P>clattering along the aisles with trays covered with glasses;



<P>stumbling over women's skirts and charging two prices for



<P>everything but beer, all with a swiftness that blurred the view of



<P>the cocoanut palms and dusty monstrosities painted upon the walls



<P>of the room.&nbsp; A bouncer, with an immense load of business upon

his



<P>hands, plunged about in the crowd, dragging bashful strangers to



<P>prominent chairs, ordering waiters here and there and quarreling



<P>furiously with men who wanted to sing with the orchestra.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The usual smoke cloud was present, but so dense that heads and



<P>arms seemed entangled in it.&nbsp; The rumble of conversation was



<P>replaced by a roar.&nbsp; Plenteous oaths heaved through the air.



<P>The room rang with the shrill voices of women bubbling o'er with



<P>drink-laughter.&nbsp; The chief element in the music of the orchestra



<P>was speed.&nbsp; The musicians played in intent fury.&nbsp; A woman

was



<P>singing and smiling upon the stage, but no one took notice of her.



<P>The rate at which the piano, cornet and violins were going, seemed



<P>to impart wildness to the half-drunken crowd.&nbsp; Beer glasses were



<P>emptied at a gulp and conversation became a rapid chatter.



<P>The smoke eddied and swirled like a shadowy river hurrying toward



<P>some unseen falls.&nbsp; Pete and Maggie entered the hall and took chairs



<P>at a table near the door.&nbsp; The woman who was seated there made



<P>an attempt to occupy Pete's attention and, failing, went away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Three weeks had passed since the girl had left home.&nbsp; The air of



<P>spaniel-like dependence had been magnified and showed its direct



<P>effect in the peculiar off-handedness and ease of Pete's ways toward

her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She followed Pete's eyes with hers, anticipating with smiles



<P>gracious looks from him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A woman of brilliance and audacity, accompanied by a mere boy,



<P>came into the place and took seats near them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At once Pete sprang to his feet, his face beaming with glad surprise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By Gawd, there's Nellie," he cried.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He went over to the table and held out an eager hand to the woman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, hello, Pete, me boy, how are you," said she, giving him her fingers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie took instant note of the woman.&nbsp; She perceived that her



<P>black dress fitted her to perfection.&nbsp; Her linen collar and cuffs



<P>were spotless.&nbsp; Tan gloves were stretched over her well-shaped



<P>hands.&nbsp; A hat of a prevailing fashion perched jauntily upon her



<P>dark hair.&nbsp; She wore no jewelry and was painted with no apparent



<P>paint.&nbsp; She looked clear-eyed through the stares of the men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sit down, and call your lady-friend over," she said cordially to Pete.



<P>At his beckoning Maggie came and sat between Pete and the mere boy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought yeh were gone away fer good," began Pete, at once.



<P>"When did yeh git back?&nbsp; How did dat Buff'lo bus'ness turn out?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman shrugged her shoulders.&nbsp; "Well, he didn't have as



<P>many stamps as he tried to make out, so I shook him, that's all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I'm glad teh see yehs back in deh city," said Pete,



<P>with awkward gallantry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He and the woman entered into a long conversation, exchanging



<P>reminiscences of days together.&nbsp; Maggie sat still, unable to



<P>formulate an intelligent sentence upon the conversation and



<P>painfully aware of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She saw Pete's eyes sparkle as he gazed upon the handsome



<P>stranger.&nbsp; He listened smilingly to all she said.&nbsp; The woman

was



<P>familiar with all his affairs, asked him about mutual friends,



<P>and knew the amount of his salary.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She paid no attention to Maggie, looking toward her once or



<P>twice and apparently seeing the wall beyond.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mere boy was sulky.&nbsp; In the beginning he had welcomed with



<P>acclamations the additions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let's all have a drink!&nbsp; What'll you take, Nell?&nbsp; And you,



<P>Miss what's-your-name.&nbsp; Have a drink, Mr. -----, you, I mean."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had shown a sprightly desire to do the talking for the company



<P>and tell all about his family.&nbsp; In a loud voice he declaimed



<P>on various topics.&nbsp; He assumed a patronizing air toward Pete.



<P>As Maggie was silent, he paid no attention to her.&nbsp; He made a



<P>great show of lavishing wealth upon the woman of brilliance



<P>and audacity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do keep still, Freddie!&nbsp; You gibber like an ape, dear," said the



<P>woman to him.&nbsp; She turned away and devoted her attention to Pete.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We'll have many a good time together again, eh?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sure, Mike," said Pete, enthusiastic at once.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Say," whispered she, leaning forward, "let's go over to



<P>Billie's and have a heluva time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, it's dis way!&nbsp; See?" said Pete.&nbsp; I got dis lady frien'

here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, t'hell with her," argued the woman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pete appeared disturbed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All right," said she, nodding her head at him.&nbsp; "All right for

you!



<P>We'll see the next time you ask me to go anywheres with you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pete squirmed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Say," he said, beseechingly, "come wid me a minit an' I'll tell yer

why."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman waved her hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, that's all right, you needn't explain, you know.&nbsp; You wouldn't



<P>come merely because you wouldn't come, that's all there is of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To Pete's visible distress she turned to the mere boy,



<P>bringing him speedily from a terrific rage.&nbsp; He had been debating



<P>whether it would be the part of a man to pick a quarrel with Pete,



<P>or would he be justified in striking him savagely with his beer



<P>glass without warning.&nbsp; But he recovered himself when the woman



<P>turned to renew her smilings.&nbsp; He beamed upon her with an



<P>expression that was somewhat tipsy and inexpressibly tender.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Say, shake that Bowery jay," requested he, in a loud whisper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Freddie, you are so droll," she replied.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pete reached forward and touched the woman on the arm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come out a minit while I tells yeh why I can't go wid yer.



<P>Yer doin' me dirt, Nell!&nbsp; I never taut ye'd do me dirt, Nell.



<P>Come on, will yer?"&nbsp; He spoke in tones of injury.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, I don't see why I should be interested in your



<P>explanations," said the woman, with a coldness that seemed to



<P>reduce Pete to a pulp.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His eyes pleaded with her.&nbsp; "Come out a minit while I tells yeh."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman nodded slightly at Maggie and the mere boy, "'Scuse me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mere boy interrupted his loving smile and turned a shrivelling



<P>glare upon Pete.&nbsp; His boyish countenance flushed and he spoke,



<P>in a whine, to the woman:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, I say, Nellie, this ain't a square deal, you know.&nbsp; You aren't



<P>goin' to leave me and go off with that duffer, are you?&nbsp; I should

think--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, you dear boy, of course I'm not," cried the woman,



<P>affectionately.&nbsp; She bended over and whispered in his ear.



<P>He smiled again and settled in his chair as if resolved



<P>to wait patiently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the woman walked down between the rows of tables, Pete was



<P>at her shoulder talking earnestly, apparently in explanation.



<P>The woman waved her hands with studied airs of indifference.



<P>The doors swung behind them, leaving Maggie and the mere boy



<P>seated at the table.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie was dazed.&nbsp; She could dimly perceive that something



<P>stupendous had happened.&nbsp; She wondered why Pete saw fit to



<P>remonstrate with the woman, pleading for forgiveness with his eyes.



<P>She thought she noted an air of submission about her leonine Pete.



<P>She was astounded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mere boy occupied himself with cock-tails and a cigar.&nbsp; He



<P>was tranquilly silent for half an hour.&nbsp; Then he bestirred himself



<P>and spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," he said, sighing, "I knew this was the way it would be."



<P>There was another stillness.&nbsp; The mere boy seemed to be musing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She was pulling m'leg.&nbsp; That's the whole amount of it," he



<P>said, suddenly.&nbsp; "It's a bloomin' shame the way that girl does.



<P>Why, I've spent over two dollars in drinks to-night.&nbsp; And she goes



<P>off with that plug-ugly who looks as if he had been hit in the face



<P>with a coin-die.&nbsp; I call it rocky treatment for a fellah like me.



<P>Here, waiter, bring me a cock-tail and make it damned strong."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie made no reply.&nbsp; She was watching the doors.&nbsp; "It's

a



<P>mean piece of business," complained the mere boy.&nbsp; He explained

to



<P>her how amazing it was that anybody should treat him in such a



<P>manner.&nbsp; "But I'll get square with her, you bet.&nbsp; She won't

get far



<P>ahead of yours truly, you know," he added, winking.&nbsp; "I'll tell

her



<P>plainly that it was bloomin' mean business.&nbsp; And she won't come

it



<P>over me with any of her 'now-Freddie-dears.'&nbsp; She thinks my name

is



<P>Freddie, you know, but of course it ain't.&nbsp; I always tell these



<P>people some name like that, because if they got onto your right name



<P>they might use it sometime.&nbsp; Understand?&nbsp; Oh, they don't fool

me much."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie was paying no attention, being intent upon the doors.



<P>The mere boy relapsed into a period of gloom, during which he



<P>exterminated a number of cock-tails with a determined air, as if



<P>replying defiantly to fate.&nbsp; He occasionally broke forth into



<P>sentences composed of invectives joined together in a long string.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girl was still staring at the doors.&nbsp; After a time



<P>the mere boy began to see cobwebs just in front of his nose.



<P>He spurred himself into being agreeable and insisted upon her



<P>having a charlotte-russe and a glass of beer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They's gone," he remarked, "they's gone."&nbsp; He looked at her



<P>through the smoke wreaths.&nbsp; "Shay, lil' girl, we mightish well

make



<P>bes' of it.&nbsp; You ain't such bad-lookin' girl, y'know.&nbsp; Not

half



<P>bad.&nbsp; Can't come up to Nell, though.&nbsp; No, can't do it!&nbsp;

Well, I



<P>should shay not!&nbsp; Nell fine-lookin' girl!&nbsp; F--i--n--ine.&nbsp;

You look



<P>damn bad longsider her, but by y'self ain't so bad.&nbsp; Have to do



<P>anyhow.&nbsp; Nell gone.&nbsp; On'y you left.&nbsp; Not half bad, though."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie stood up.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm going home," she said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mere boy started.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Eh?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Home," he cried, struck with amazement.



<P>"I beg pardon, did hear say home?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm going home," she repeated.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Great Gawd, what hava struck," demanded the mere boy of himself, stupefied.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a semi-comatose state he conducted her on board an up-town car,



<P>ostentatiously paid her fare, leered kindly at her through the



<P>rear window and fell off the steps.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Pete did not consider that he had ruined Maggie.&nbsp; If he had



<P>thought that her soul could never smile again, he would have



<P>believed the mother and brother, who were pyrotechnic over the



<P>affair, to be responsible for it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Besides, in his world, souls did not insist upon being able to smile.



<P>"What deh hell?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He felt a trifle entangled.&nbsp; It distressed him.&nbsp; Revelations



<P>and scenes might bring upon him the wrath of the owner of the



<P>saloon, who insisted upon respectability of an advanced type.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What deh hell do dey wanna raise such a smoke about it fer?"



<P>demanded he of himself, disgusted with the attitude of the family.



<P>He saw no necessity for anyone's losing their equilibrium merely



<P>because their sister or their daughter had stayed away from home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Searching about in his mind for possible reasons for their conduct,



<P>he came upon the conclusion that Maggie's motives were correct,



<P>but that the two others wished to snare him.&nbsp; He felt pursued.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman of brilliance and audacity whom he had met in the



<P>hilarious hall showed a disposition to ridicule him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A little pale thing with no spirit," she said.&nbsp; "Did you note



<P>the expression of her eyes?&nbsp; There was something in them about



<P>pumpkin pie and virtue.&nbsp; That is a peculiar way the left corner



<P>of her mouth has of twitching, isn't it?&nbsp; Dear, dear, my cloud-



<P>compelling Pete, what are you coming to?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pete asserted at once that he never was very much interested



<P>in the girl.&nbsp; The woman interrupted him, laughing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, it's not of the slightest consequence to me, my dear young man.



<P>You needn't draw maps for my benefit.&nbsp; Why should I be concerned

about it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Pete continued with his explanations.&nbsp; If he was laughed



<P>at for his tastes in women, he felt obliged to say that they were



<P>only temporary or indifferent ones.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The morning after Maggie had departed from home, Pete stood



<P>behind the bar.&nbsp; He was immaculate in white jacket and apron and



<P>his hair was plastered over his brow with infinite correctness.



<P>No customers were in the place.&nbsp; Pete was twisting his napkined



<P>fist slowly in a beer glass, softly whistling to himself and



<P>occasionally holding the object of his attention between his eyes



<P>and a few weak beams of sunlight that had found their way over



<P>the thick screens and into the shaded room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With lingering thoughts of the woman of brilliance and



<P>audacity, the bartender raised his head and stared through the



<P>varying cracks between the swaying bamboo doors.&nbsp; Suddenly



<P>the whistling pucker faded from his lips.&nbsp; He saw Maggie walking



<P>slowly past.&nbsp; He gave a great start, fearing for the previously-



<P>mentioned eminent respectability of the place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He threw a swift, nervous glance about him, all at once



<P>feeling guilty.&nbsp; No one was in the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He went hastily over to the side door.&nbsp; Opening it and looking



<P>out, he perceived Maggie standing, as if undecided, on the corner.



<P>She was searching the place with her eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she turned her face toward him Pete beckoned to her



<P>hurriedly, intent upon returning with speed to a position behind



<P>the bar and to the atmosphere of respectability upon which the



<P>proprietor insisted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie came to him, the anxious look disappearing from her



<P>face and a smile wreathing her lips.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Pete--," she began brightly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The bartender made a violent gesture of impatience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, my Gawd," cried he, vehemently.&nbsp; "What deh hell do yeh



<P>wanna hang aroun' here fer?&nbsp; Do yeh wanna git me inteh trouble?"



<P>he demanded with an air of injury.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Astonishment swept over the girl's features.&nbsp; "Why, Pete! yehs

tol' me--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pete glanced profound irritation.&nbsp; His countenance reddened



<P>with the anger of a man whose respectability is being threatened.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Say, yehs makes me tired.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; What deh hell deh yeh wanna



<P>tag aroun' atter me fer?&nbsp; Yeh'll git me inteh trouble wid deh ol'



<P>man an' dey'll be hell teh pay!&nbsp; If he sees a woman roun' here



<P>he'll go crazy an' I'll lose me job!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; Yer brudder come

in



<P>here an' raised hell an' deh ol' man hada put up fer it!&nbsp; An' now



<P>I'm done!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; I'm done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girl's eyes stared into his face.&nbsp; "Pete, don't yeh remem--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, hell," interrupted Pete, anticipating.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girl seemed to have a struggle with herself.&nbsp; She was apparently



<P>bewildered and could not find speech.&nbsp; Finally she asked in a low

voice:



<P>"But where kin I go?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The question exasperated Pete beyond the powers of endurance.



<P>It was a direct attempt to give him some responsibility in a matter



<P>that did not concern him.&nbsp; In his indignation he volunteered information.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, go teh hell," cried he.&nbsp; He slammed the door furiously



<P>and returned, with an air of relief, to his respectability.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie went away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She wandered aimlessly for several blocks.&nbsp; She stopped once



<P>and asked aloud a question of herself: "Who?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A man who was passing near her shoulder, humorously took the



<P>questioning word as intended for him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Eh?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; Nobody!&nbsp; I didn't say anything,"



<P>he laughingly said, and continued his way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Soon the girl discovered that if she walked with such



<P>apparent aimlessness, some men looked at her with calculating eyes.



<P>She quickened her step, frightened.&nbsp; As a protection, she adopted



<P>a demeanor of intentness as if going somewhere.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a time she left rattling avenues and passed between rows



<P>of houses with sternness and stolidity stamped upon their features.



<P>She hung her head for she felt their eyes grimly upon her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Suddenly she came upon a stout gentleman in a silk hat and a



<P>chaste black coat, whose decorous row of buttons reached from his



<P>chin to his knees.&nbsp; The girl had heard of the Grace of God and

she



<P>decided to approach this man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His beaming, chubby face was a picture of benevolence and



<P>kind-heartedness.&nbsp; His eyes shone good-will.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But as the girl timidly accosted him, he gave a convulsive



<P>movement and saved his respectability by a vigorous side-step.



<P>He did not risk it to save a soul.&nbsp; For how was he to know that



<P>there was a soul before him that needed saving?

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Eventually they entered into a dark region where, from a



<P>careening building, a dozen gruesome doorways gave up loads of



<P>babies to the street and the gutter.&nbsp; A wind of early autumn raised



<P>yellow dust from cobbles and swirled it against an hundred windows.



<P>Long streamers of garments fluttered from fire-escapes.&nbsp; In all



<P>unhandy places there were buckets, brooms, rags and bottles.&nbsp; In



<P>the street infants played or fought with other infants or sat



<P>stupidly in the way of vehicles.&nbsp; Formidable women, with uncombed



<P>hair and disordered dress, gossiped while leaning on railings, or



<P>screamed in frantic quarrels.&nbsp; Withered persons, in curious



<P>postures of submission to something, sat smoking pipes in obscure



<P>corners.&nbsp; A thousand odors of cooking food came forth to the



<P>street.&nbsp; The building quivered and creaked from the weight of



<P>humanity stamping about in its bowels.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A small ragged girl dragged a red, bawling infant along the



<P>crowded ways.&nbsp; He was hanging back, baby-like, bracing his



<P>wrinkled, bare legs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The little girl cried out: "Ah, Tommie, come ahn.



<P>Dere's Jimmie and fader.&nbsp; Don't be a-pullin' me back."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She jerked the baby's arm impatiently.&nbsp; He fell on his face,



<P>roaring.&nbsp; With a second jerk she pulled him to his feet, and they



<P>went on.&nbsp; With the obstinacy of his order, he protested against



<P>being dragged in a chosen direction.&nbsp; He made heroic endeavors

to



<P>keep on his legs, denounce his sister and consume a bit of orange



<P>peeling which he chewed between the times of his infantile



<P>orations.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the sullen-eyed man, followed by the blood-covered boy,



<P>drew near, the little girl burst into reproachful cries.



<P>"Ah, Jimmie, youse bin fightin' agin."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The urchin swelled disdainfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, what deh hell, Mag.&nbsp; See?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The little girl upbraided him,&nbsp; "Youse allus fightin', Jimmie,



<P>an' yeh knows it puts mudder out when yehs come home half dead,



<P>an' it's like we'll all get a poundin'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She began to weep.&nbsp; The babe threw back his head and roared at



<P>his prospects.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, what deh hell!" cried Jimmie.&nbsp; Shut up er I'll smack yer mout'.&nbsp;

See?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As his sister continued her lamentations, he suddenly swore



<P>and struck her.&nbsp; The little girl reeled and, recovering herself,



<P>burst into tears and quaveringly cursed him.&nbsp; As she slowly



<P>retreated her brother advanced dealing her cuffs.&nbsp; The father heard



<P>and turned about.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Stop that, Jim, d'yeh hear?&nbsp; Leave yer sister alone on the



<P>street.&nbsp; It's like I can never beat any sense into yer damned



<P>wooden head."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The urchin raised his voice in defiance to his parent and



<P>continued his attacks.&nbsp; The babe bawled tremendously, protesting



<P>with great violence.&nbsp; During his sister's hasty manoeuvres, he

was



<P>dragged by the arm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Finally the procession plunged into one of the gruesome doorways.



<P>They crawled up dark stairways and along cold, gloomy halls.



<P>At last the father pushed open a door and they entered a lighted room



<P>in which a large woman was rampant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She stopped in a career from a seething stove to a pan-covered table.



<P>As the father and children filed in she peered at them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Eh, what?&nbsp; Been fightin' agin, by Gawd!"&nbsp; She threw herself



<P>upon Jimmie.&nbsp; The urchin tried to dart behind the others and in

the



<P>scuffle the babe, Tommie, was knocked down.&nbsp; He protested with

his



<P>usual vehemence, because they had bruised his tender shins against



<P>a table leg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mother's massive shoulders heaved with anger.&nbsp; Grasping the



<P>urchin by the neck and shoulder she shook him until he rattled.



<P>She dragged him to an unholy sink, and, soaking a rag in water,



<P>began to scrub his lacerated face with it.&nbsp; Jimmie screamed in

pain



<P>and tried to twist his shoulders out of the clasp of the huge arms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The babe sat on the floor watching the scene, his face in contortions



<P>like that of a woman at a tragedy.&nbsp; The father, with a newly-ladened



<P>pipe in his mouth, crouched on a backless chair near the stove.



<P>Jimmie's cries annoyed him.&nbsp; He turned about and bellowed at his

wife:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let the damned kid alone for a minute, will yeh, Mary?&nbsp; Yer allus



<P>poundin' 'im.&nbsp; When I come nights I can't git no rest 'cause



<P>yer allus poundin' a kid.&nbsp; Let up, d'yeh hear?&nbsp; Don't be allus



<P>poundin' a kid."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman's operations on the urchin instantly increased in violence.



<P>At last she tossed him to a corner where he limply lay cursing and weeping.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The wife put her immense hands on her hips and with a



<P>chieftain-like stride approached her husband.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ho," she said, with a great grunt of contempt.&nbsp; "An' what in



<P>the devil are you stickin' your nose for?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The babe crawled under the table and, turning, peered out



<P>cautiously.&nbsp; The ragged girl retreated and the urchin in the corner



<P>drew his legs carefully beneath him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The man puffed his pipe calmly and put his great mudded boots



<P>on the back part of the stove.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go teh hell," he murmured, tranquilly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman screamed and shook her fists before her husband's



<P>eyes.&nbsp; The rough yellow of her face and neck flared suddenly



<P>crimson.&nbsp; She began to howl.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He puffed imperturbably at his pipe for a time, but finally



<P>arose and began to look out at the window into the darkening chaos



<P>of back yards.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You've been drinkin', Mary," he said.&nbsp; "You'd better let up



<P>on the bot', ol' woman, or you'll git done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You're a liar.&nbsp; I ain't had a drop," she roared in reply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They had a lurid altercation, in which they damned each



<P>other's souls with frequence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The babe was staring out from under the table, his small face



<P>working in his excitement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The ragged girl went stealthily over to the corner where the



<P>urchin lay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are yehs hurted much, Jimmie?" she whispered timidly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a damn bit!&nbsp; See?" growled the little boy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Will I wash deh blood?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Naw!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Will I--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When I catch dat Riley kid I'll break 'is face!&nbsp; Dat's right!&nbsp;

See?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He turned his face to the wall as if resolved to grimly bide



<P>his time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the quarrel between husband and wife, the woman was victor.



<P>The man grabbed his hat and rushed from the room, apparently



<P>determined upon a vengeful drunk.&nbsp; She followed to the door and



<P>thundered at him as he made his way down stairs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She returned and stirred up the room until her children were



<P>bobbing about like bubbles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Git outa deh way," she persistently bawled, waving feet



<P>with their dishevelled shoes near the heads of her children.



<P>She shrouded herself, puffing and snorting, in a cloud of steam



<P>at the stove, and eventually extracted a frying-pan full of potatoes



<P>that hissed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She flourished it.&nbsp; "Come teh yer suppers, now," she cried



<P>with sudden exasperation.&nbsp; "Hurry up, now, er I'll help yeh!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The children scrambled hastily.&nbsp; With prodigious clatter they



<P>arranged themselves at table.&nbsp; The babe sat with his feet dangling



<P>high from a precarious infant chair and gorged his small stomach.



<P>Jimmie forced, with feverish rapidity, the grease-enveloped pieces



<P>between his wounded lips.&nbsp; Maggie, with side glances of fear of



<P>interruption, ate like a small pursued tigress.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mother sat blinking at them.&nbsp; She delivered reproaches,



<P>swallowed potatoes and drank from a yellow-brown bottle.



<P>After a time her mood changed and she wept as she carried



<P>little Tommie into another room and laid him to sleep



<P>with his fists doubled in an old quilt of faded red



<P>and green grandeur.&nbsp; Then she came and moaned by the stove.



<P>She rocked to and fro upon a chair, shedding tears



<P>and crooning miserably to the two children about their



<P>"poor mother" and "yer fader, damn 'is soul."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The little girl plodded between the table and the chair with



<P>a dish-pan on it.&nbsp; She tottered on her small legs beneath burdens



<P>of dishes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie sat nursing his various wounds.&nbsp; He cast furtive glances



<P>at his mother.&nbsp; His practised eye perceived her gradually emerge



<P>from a muddled mist of sentiment until her brain burned in



<P>drunken heat.&nbsp; He sat breathless.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maggie broke a plate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mother started to her feet as if propelled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good Gawd," she howled.&nbsp; Her eyes glittered on her child with



<P>sudden hatred.&nbsp; The fervent red of her face turned almost to



<P>purple.&nbsp; The little boy ran to the halls, shrieking like a monk

in



<P>an earthquake.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He floundered about in darkness until he found the stairs.&nbsp; He

stumbled,



<P>panic-stricken, to the next floor.&nbsp; An old woman opened a door.



<P>A light behind her threw a flare on the urchin's quivering face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Eh, Gawd, child, what is it dis time?&nbsp; Is yer fader beatin'



<P>yer mudder, or yer mudder beatin' yer fader?"

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Jimmie and the old woman listened long in the hall.&nbsp; Above the



<P>muffled roar of conversation, the dismal wailings of babies at



<P>night, the thumping of feet in unseen corridors and rooms, mingled



<P>with the sound of varied hoarse shoutings in the street and the



<P>rattling of wheels over cobbles, they heard the screams of the



<P>child and the roars of the mother die away to a feeble moaning and



<P>a subdued bass muttering.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The old woman was a gnarled and leathery personage who could



<P>don, at will, an expression of great virtue.&nbsp; She possessed a small



<P>music-box capable of one tune, and a collection of "God bless yehs"



<P>pitched in assorted keys of fervency.&nbsp; Each day she took a position



<P>upon the stones of Fifth Avenue, where she crooked her legs under



<P>her and crouched immovable and hideous, like an idol.&nbsp; She received



<P>daily a small sum in pennies.&nbsp; It was contributed, for the most



<P>part, by persons who did not make their homes in that vicinity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Once, when a lady had dropped her purse on the sidewalk, the



<P>gnarled woman had grabbed it and smuggled it with great dexterity



<P>beneath her cloak.&nbsp; When she was arrested she had cursed the lady



<P>into a partial swoon, and with her aged limbs, twisted from



<P>rheumatism, had almost kicked the stomach out of a huge policeman



<P>whose conduct upon that occasion she referred to when she said:



<P>"The police, damn 'em."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Eh, Jimmie, it's cursed shame," she said.&nbsp; "Go, now, like a dear



<P>an' buy me a can, an' if yer mudder raises 'ell all night yehs



<P>can sleep here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie took a tendered tin-pail and seven pennies and departed.



<P>He passed into the side door of a saloon and went to the bar.



<P>Straining up on his toes he raised the pail and pennies as high



<P>as his arms would let him.&nbsp; He saw two hands thrust down and take

them.



<P>Directly the same hands let down the filled pail and he left.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In front of the gruesome doorway he met a lurching figure.



<P>It was his father, swaying about on uncertain legs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Give me deh can.&nbsp; See?" said the man, threateningly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, come off!&nbsp; I got dis can fer dat ol' woman an' it 'ud be



<P>dirt teh swipe it.&nbsp; See?" cried Jimmie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The father wrenched the pail from the urchin.&nbsp; He grasped it



<P>in both hands and lifted it to his mouth.&nbsp; He glued his lips to

the



<P>under edge and tilted his head.&nbsp; His hairy throat swelled until

it



<P>seemed to grow near his chin.&nbsp; There was a tremendous gulping



<P>movement and the beer was gone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The man caught his breath and laughed.&nbsp; He hit his son on the



<P>head with the empty pail.&nbsp; As it rolled clanging into the street,



<P>Jimmie began to scream and kicked repeatedly at his father's shins.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Look at deh dirt what yeh done me," he yelled.&nbsp; "Deh ol'



<P>woman 'ill be raisin' hell."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He retreated to the middle of the street, but the man did not



<P>pursue.&nbsp; He staggered toward the door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll club hell outa yeh when I ketch yeh," he shouted, and



<P>disappeared.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>During the evening he had been standing against a bar drinking



<P>whiskies and declaring to all comers, confidentially: "My home



<P>reg'lar livin' hell!&nbsp; Damndes' place!&nbsp; Reg'lar hell!&nbsp;

Why do I come



<P>an' drin' whisk' here thish way?&nbsp; 'Cause home reg'lar livin' hell!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie waited a long time in the street and then crept warily



<P>up through the building.&nbsp; He passed with great caution the door

of



<P>the gnarled woman, and finally stopped outside his home and listened.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He could hear his mother moving heavily about among the



<P>furniture of the room.&nbsp; She was chanting in a mournful voice,



<P>occasionally interjecting bursts of volcanic wrath at the father,



<P>who, Jimmie judged, had sunk down on the floor or in a corner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why deh blazes don' chere try teh keep Jim from fightin'?



<P>I'll break her jaw," she suddenly bellowed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The man mumbled with drunken indifference.&nbsp; "Ah, wha' deh



<P>hell.&nbsp; W'a's odds?&nbsp; Wha' makes kick?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Because he tears 'is clothes, yeh damn fool," cried the woman



<P>in supreme wrath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The husband seemed to become aroused.&nbsp; "Go teh hell," he



<P>thundered fiercely in reply.&nbsp; There was a crash against the door



<P>and something broke into clattering fragments.&nbsp; Jimmie partially



<P>suppressed a howl and darted down the stairway.&nbsp; Below he paused



<P>and listened.&nbsp; He heard howls and curses, groans and shrieks,



<P>confusingly in chorus as if a battle were raging.&nbsp; With all was

the



<P>crash of splintering furniture.&nbsp; The eyes of the urchin glared

in



<P>fear that one of them would discover him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Curious faces appeared in doorways, and whispered comments



<P>passed to and fro.&nbsp; "Ol' Johnson's raisin' hell agin."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie stood until the noises ceased and the other inhabitants



<P>of the tenement had all yawned and shut their doors.&nbsp; Then he



<P>crawled upstairs with the caution of an invader of a panther den.



<P>Sounds of labored breathing came through the broken door-panels.



<P>He pushed the door open and entered, quaking.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A glow from the fire threw red hues over the bare floor, the cracked



<P>and soiled plastering, and the overturned and broken furniture.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the middle of the floor lay his mother asleep.&nbsp; In one



<P>corner of the room his father's limp body hung across the seat



<P>of a chair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The urchin stole forward.&nbsp; He began to shiver in dread of



<P>awakening his parents.&nbsp; His mother's great chest was heaving



<P>painfully.&nbsp; Jimmie paused and looked down at her.&nbsp; Her face

was



<P>inflamed and swollen from drinking.&nbsp; Her yellow brows shaded eye-



<P>lids that had brown blue.&nbsp; Her tangled hair tossed in waves over



<P>her forehead.&nbsp; Her mouth was set in the same lines of vindictive



<P>hatred that it had, perhaps, borne during the fight.&nbsp; Her bare,



<P>red arms were thrown out above her head in positions of exhaustion,



<P>something, mayhap, like those of a sated villain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The urchin bended over his mother.&nbsp; He was fearful lest she



<P>should open her eyes, and the dread within him was so strong,



<P>that he could not forbear to stare, but hung as if fascinated



<P>over the woman's grim face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Suddenly her eyes opened.&nbsp; The urchin found himself looking



<P>straight into that expression, which, it would seem, had the power



<P>to change his blood to salt.&nbsp; He howled piercingly and fell



<P>backward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman floundered for a moment, tossed her arms about her



<P>head as if in combat, and again began to snore.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jimmie crawled back in the shadows and waited.&nbsp; A noise in the



<P>next room had followed his cry at the discovery that his mother was



<P>awake.&nbsp; He grovelled in the gloom, the eyes from out his drawn

face



<P>riveted upon the intervening door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He heard it creak, and then the sound of a small voice came to



<P>him.&nbsp; "Jimmie!&nbsp; Jimmie!&nbsp; Are yehs dere?" it whispered.&nbsp;

The urchin



<P>started.&nbsp; The thin, white face of his sister looked at him from

the



<P>door-way of the other room.&nbsp; She crept to him across the floor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The father had not moved, but lay in the same death-like



<P>sleep.&nbsp; The mother writhed in uneasy slumber, her chest wheezing

as



<P>if she were in the agonies of strangulation.&nbsp; Out at the window

a



<P>florid moon was peering over dark roofs, and in the distance the



<P>waters of a river glimmered pallidly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The small frame of the ragged girl was quivering.&nbsp; Her



<P>features were haggard from weeping, and her eyes gleamed from fear.



<P>She grasped the urchin's arm in her little trembling hands and they



<P>huddled in a corner.&nbsp; The eyes of both were drawn, by some force,



<P>to stare at the woman's face, for they thought she need only to



<P>awake and all fiends would come from below.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They crouched until the ghost-mists of dawn appeared at the



<P>window, drawing close to the panes, and looking in at the



<P>prostrate, heaving body of the mother.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Upon a wet evening, several months after the last chapter,



<P>two interminable rows of cars, pulled by slipping horses,



<P>jangled along a prominent side-street.&nbsp; A dozen cabs, with coat-enshrouded



<P>drivers, clattered to and fro.&nbsp; Electric lights, whirring softly,



<P>shed a blurred radiance.&nbsp; A flower dealer, his feet tapping



<P>impatiently, his nose and his wares glistening with rain-drops,



<P>stood behind an array of roses and chrysanthemums.&nbsp; Two or three



<P>theatres emptied a crowd upon the storm-swept pavements.&nbsp; Men



<P>pulled their hats over their eyebrows and raised their collars to



<P>their ears.&nbsp; Women shrugged impatient shoulders in their warm



<P>cloaks and stopped to arrange their skirts for a walk through the



<P>storm.&nbsp; People having been comparatively silent for two hours burst



<P>into a roar of conversation, their hearts still kindling from the



<P>glowings of the stage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The pavements became tossing seas of umbrellas.&nbsp; Men stepped



<P>forth to hail cabs or cars, raising their fingers in varied forms



<P>of polite request or imperative demand.&nbsp; An endless procession



<P>wended toward elevated stations.&nbsp; An atmosphere of pleasure and



<P>prosperity seemed to hang over the throng, born, perhaps, of good



<P>clothes and of having just emerged from a place of forgetfulness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the mingled light and gloom of an adjacent park,



<P>a handful of wet wanderers, in attitudes of chronic dejection,



<P>was scattered among the benches.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A girl of the painted cohorts of the city went along the street.



<P>She threw changing glances at men who passed her, giving smiling



<P>invitations to men of rural or untaught pattern and usually seeming



<P>sedately unconscious of the men with a metropolitan seal upon their

faces.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Crossing glittering avenues, she went into the throng emerging



<P>from the places of forgetfulness.&nbsp; She hurried forward through

the



<P>crowd as if intent upon reaching a distant home, bending forward in



<P>her handsome cloak, daintily lifting her skirts and picking for her



<P>well-shod feet the dryer spots upon the pavements.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The restless doors of saloons, clashing to and fro, disclosed



<P>animated rows of men before bars and hurrying barkeepers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A concert hall gave to the street faint sounds of swift,



<P>machine-like music, as if a group of phantom musicians were



<P>hastening.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A tall young man, smoking a cigarette with a sublime air,



<P>strolled near the girl.&nbsp; He had on evening dress, a moustache,

a



<P>chrysanthemum, and a look of ennui, all of which he kept carefully



<P>under his eye.&nbsp; Seeing the girl walk on as if such a young man

as



<P>he was not in existence, he looked back transfixed with interest.



<P>He stared glassily for a moment, but gave a slight convulsive start



<P>when he discerned that she was neither new, Parisian, nor theatrical.



<P>He wheeled about hastily and turned his stare into the air,



<P>like a sailor with a search-light.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A stout gentleman, with pompous and philanthropic whiskers,



<P>went stolidly by, the broad of his back sneering at the girl.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A belated man in business clothes, and in haste to catch a



<P>car, bounced against her shoulder.&nbsp; "Hi, there, Mary, I beg your



<P>pardon!&nbsp; Brace up, old girl."&nbsp; He grasped her arm to steady

her,



<P>and then was away running down the middle of the street.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girl walked on out of the realm of restaurants and



<P>saloons.&nbsp; She passed more glittering avenues and went into darker



<P>blocks than those where the crowd travelled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A young man in light overcoat and derby hat received a glance



<P>shot keenly from the eyes of the girl.&nbsp; He stopped and looked at



<P>her, thrusting his hands in his pockets and making a mocking smile



<P>curl his lips.&nbsp; "Come, now, old lady," he said, "you don't mean

to



<P>tell me that you sized me up for a farmer?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A laboring man marched along with bundles under his arms.



<P>To her remarks, he replied: "It's a fine evenin', ain't it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She smiled squarely into the face of a boy who was hurrying by



<P>with his hands buried in his overcoat, his blonde locks bobbing on



<P>his youthful temples, and a cheery smile of unconcern upon his



<P>lips.&nbsp; He turned his head and smiled back at her, waving his hands.



<P>him.&nbsp; "He's all right!&nbsp; He didn't mean anything!&nbsp; Let

it go!



<P>He's a good fellah!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Din' he insul' me?" asked the man earnestly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," said they.&nbsp; "Of course he didn't!&nbsp; He's all right!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sure he didn' insul' me?" demanded the man, with deep anxiety



<P>in his voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no!&nbsp; We know him!&nbsp; He's a good fellah.&nbsp; He didn't

mean anything."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, zen," said the man, resolutely, "I'm go' 'pol'gize!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the waiter came, the man struggled to the middle of the floor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Girlsh shed you insul' me!&nbsp; I shay damn lie!&nbsp; I 'pol'gize!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All right," said the waiter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The man sat down.&nbsp; He felt a sleepy but strong desire to straighten



<P>things out and have a perfect understanding with everybody.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nell, I allus trea's yeh shquare, din' I?&nbsp; Yeh likes me, don'

yehs, Nell?



<P>I'm goo' f'ler?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sure," said the woman of brilliance and audacity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yeh knows I'm stuck on yehs, don' yehs, Nell?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sure," she repeated, carelessly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Overwhelmed by a spasm of drunken adoration, he drew two or



<P>three bills from his pocket, and, with the trembling fingers of an



<P>offering priest, laid them on the table before the woman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yehs knows, damn it, yehs kin have all got, 'cause I'm stuck on yehs,



<P>Nell, damn't, I--I'm stuck on yehs, Nell--buy drinksh--damn't--we're

havin'



<P>heluva time--w'en anyone trea's me ri'--I--damn't, Nell--we're havin'



<P>heluva--time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Shortly he went to sleep with his swollen face fallen forward on his

chest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The women drank and laughed, not heeding the slumbering man in the corner.



<P>Finally he lurched forward and fell groaning to the floor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The women screamed in disgust and drew back their skirts.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come ahn," cried one, starting up angrily, "let's get out of here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The woman of brilliance and audacity stayed behind, taking up



<P>the bills and stuffing them into a deep, irregularly-shaped pocket.



<P>A guttural snore from the recumbent man caused her to turn and look



<P>down at him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She laughed.&nbsp; "What a damn fool," she said, and went.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The smoke from the lamps settled heavily down in the little



<P>compartment, obscuring the way out.&nbsp; The smell of oil, stifling

in



<P>its intensity, pervaded the air.&nbsp; The wine from an overturned glass



<P>dripped softly down upon the blotches on the man's neck.
