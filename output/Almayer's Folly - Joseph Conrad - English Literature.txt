<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The news as to the identity of the body lying now in Almayer's



<P>compound spread rapidly over the settlement.&nbsp; During the forenoon



<P>most of the inhabitants remained in the long street discussing



<P>the mysterious return and the unexpected death of the man who had



<P>become known to them as the trader.&nbsp; His arrival during the



<P>north-east monsoon, his long sojourn in their midst, his sudden



<P>departure with his brig, and, above all, the mysterious



<P>appearance of the body, said to be his, amongst the logs, were



<P>subjects to wonder at and to talk over and over again with



<P>undiminished interest.&nbsp; Mahmat moved from house to house and from



<P>group to group, always ready to repeat his tale:&nbsp; how he saw the



<P>body caught by the sarong in a forked log; how Mrs. Almayer



<P>coming, one of the first, at his cries, recognised it, even



<P>before he had it hauled on shore; how Babalatchi ordered him to



<P>bring it out of the water.&nbsp; "By the feet I dragged him in, and



<P>there was no head," exclaimed Mahmat, "and how could the white



<P>man's wife know who it was?&nbsp; She was a witch, it was well known.



<P>And did you see how the white man himself ran away at the sight



<P>of the body?&nbsp; Like a deer he ran!"&nbsp; And here Mahmat imitated



<P>Almayer's long strides, to the great joy of the beholders.&nbsp; And



<P>for all his trouble he had nothing.&nbsp; The ring with the green



<P>stone Tuan Babalatchi kept.&nbsp; "Nothing!&nbsp; Nothing!"&nbsp; He

spat down



<P>at his feet in sign of disgust, and left that group to seek



<P>further on a fresh audience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The news spreading to the furthermost parts of the settlement



<P>found out Abdulla in the cool recess of his godown, where he sat



<P>overlooking his Arab clerks and the men loading and unloading the



<P>up-country canoes.&nbsp; Reshid, who was busy on the jetty, was



<P>summoned into his uncle's presence and found him, as usual, very



<P>calm and even cheerful, but very much surprised.&nbsp; The rumour of



<P>the capture or destruction of Dain's brig had reached the Arab's



<P>ears three days before from the sea-fishermen and through the



<P>dwellers on the lower reaches of the river.&nbsp; It had been passed



<P>up-stream from neighbour to neighbour till Bulangi, whose



<P>clearing was nearest to the settlement, had brought that news



<P>himself to Abdulla whose favour he courted.&nbsp; But rumour also



<P>spoke of a fight and of Dain's death on board his own vessel.



<P>And now all the settlement talked of Dain's visit to the Rajah



<P>and of his death when crossing the river in the dark to see



<P>Almayer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They could not understand this.&nbsp; Reshid thought that it was very



<P>strange.&nbsp; He felt uneasy and doubtful.&nbsp; But Abdulla, after

the



<P>first shock of surprise, with the old age's dislike for solving



<P>riddles, showed a becoming resignation.&nbsp; He remarked that the man



<P>was dead now at all events, and consequently no more dangerous.



<P>Where was the use to wonder at the decrees of Fate, especially if



<P>they were propitious to the True Believers?&nbsp; And with a pious



<P>ejaculation to Allah the Merciful, the Compassionate, Abdulla



<P>seemed to regard the incident as closed for the present.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Not so Reshid.&nbsp; He lingered by his uncle, pulling thoughtfully



<P>his neatly trimmed beard.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There are many lies," he murmured.&nbsp; "He has been dead once



<P>before, and came to life to die again now.&nbsp; The Dutch will be



<P>here before many days and clamour for the man.&nbsp; Shall I not



<P>believe my eyes sooner than the tongues of women and idle men?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They say that the body is being taken to Almayer's compound,"



<P>said Abdulla.&nbsp; "If you want to go there you must go before the



<P>Dutch arrive here.&nbsp; Go late.&nbsp; It should not be said that we

have



<P>been seen inside that man's enclosure lately."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Reshid assented to the truth of this last remark and left his



<P>uncle's side.&nbsp; He leaned against the lintel of the big doorway



<P>and looked idly across the courtyard through the open gate on to



<P>the main road of the settlement.&nbsp; It lay empty, straight, and



<P>yellow under the flood of light.&nbsp; In the hot noontide the smooth



<P>trunks of palm trees, the outlines of the houses, and away there



<P>at the other end of the road the roof of Almayer's house visible



<P>over the bushes on the dark background of forest, seemed to



<P>quiver in the heat radiating from the steaming earth.&nbsp; Swarms of



<P>yellow butterflies rose, and settled to rise again in short



<P>flights before Reshid's half-closed eyes.&nbsp; From under his feet



<P>arose the dull hum of insects in the long grass of the courtyard.



<P>He looked on sleepily.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From one of the side paths amongst the houses a woman stepped out



<P>on the road, a slight girlish figure walking under the shade of a



<P>large tray balanced on its head.&nbsp; The consciousness of something



<P>moving stirred Reshid's half-sleeping senses into a comparative



<P>wakefulness.&nbsp; He recognised Taminah, Bulangi's slave-girl, with



<P>her tray of cakes for sale--an apparition of daily recurrence and



<P>of no importance whatever.&nbsp; She was going towards Almayer's



<P>house.&nbsp; She could be made useful.&nbsp; He roused himself up and

ran



<P>towards the gate calling out, "Taminah O!"&nbsp; The girl stopped,



<P>hesitated, and came back slowly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Reshid waited, signing to her impatiently to come nearer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When near Reshid Taminah stood with downcast eyes.&nbsp; Reshid looked



<P>at her a while before he asked--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you going to Almayer's house? They say in the settlement



<P>that Dain the trader, he that was found drowned this morning, is



<P>lying in the white man's campong."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have heard this talk," whispered Taminah; "and this morning by



<P>the riverside I saw the body.&nbsp; Where it is now I do not know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So you have seen it?" asked Reshid, eagerly.&nbsp; "Is it Dain?&nbsp;

You



<P>have seen him many times.&nbsp; You would know him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girl's lips quivered and she remained silent for a while,



<P>breathing quickly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have seen him, not a long time ago," she said at last.&nbsp; "The



<P>talk is true; he is dead.&nbsp; What do you want from me, Tuan?&nbsp;

I



<P>must go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Just then the report of the gun fired on board the steam launch



<P>was heard, interrupting Reshid's reply.&nbsp; Leaving the girl he ran



<P>to the house, and met in the courtyard Abdulla coming towards the



<P>gate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The Orang Blanda are come," said Reshid, "and now we shall have



<P>our reward."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Abdulla shook his head doubtfully.&nbsp; "The white men's rewards are



<P>long in coming," he said.&nbsp; "White men are quick in anger and slow



<P>in gratitude.&nbsp; We shall see."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He stood at the gate stroking his grey beard and listening to the



<P>distant cries of greeting at the other end of the settlement.&nbsp;

As



<P>Taminah was turning to go he called her back

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Listen, girl," he said: "there will be many white men in



<P>Almayer's house.&nbsp; You shall be there selling your cakes to the



<P>men of the sea.&nbsp; What you see and what you hear you may tell me.



<P>Come here before the sun sets and I will give you a blue



<P>handkerchief with red spots.&nbsp; Now go, and forget not to return."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He gave her a push with the end of his long staff as she was



<P>going away and made her stumble.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This slave is very slow," he remarked to his nephew, looking



<P>after the girl with great disfavour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Taminah walked on, her tray on the head, her eyes fixed on the



<P>ground.&nbsp; From the open doors of the houses were heard, as she



<P>passed, friendly calls inviting her within for business purposes,



<P>but she never heeded them, neglecting her sales in the



<P>preoccupation of intense thinking.&nbsp; Since the very early morning



<P>she had heard much, she had also seen much that filled her heart



<P>with a joy mingled with great suffering and fear.&nbsp; Before the



<P>dawn, before she left Bulangi's house to paddle up to Sambir she



<P>had heard voices outside the house when all in it but herself



<P>were asleep.&nbsp; And now, with her knowledge of the words spoken in



<P>the darkness, she held in her hand a life and carried in her



<P>breast a great sorrow.&nbsp; Yet from her springy step, erect figure,



<P>and face veiled over by the everyday look of apathetic



<P>indifference, nobody could have guessed of the double load she



<P>carried under the visible burden of the tray piled up high with



<P>cakes manufactured by the thrifty hands of Bulangi's wives.&nbsp; In



<P>that supple figure straight as an arrow, so graceful and free in



<P>its walk, behind those soft eyes that spoke of nothing but of



<P>unconscious resignation, there slept all feelings and all



<P>passions, all hopes and all fears, the curse of life and the



<P>consolation of death.&nbsp; And she knew nothing of it all.&nbsp; She

lived



<P>like the tall palms amongst whom she was passing now, seeking the



<P>light, desiring the sunshine, fearing the storm, unconscious of



<P>either.&nbsp; The slave had no hope, and knew of no change.&nbsp; She

knew



<P>of no other sky, no other water, no other forest, no other world,



<P>no other life.&nbsp; She had no wish, no hope, no love, no fear except



<P>of a blow, and no vivid feeling but that of occasional hunger,



<P>which was seldom, for Bulangi was rich and rice was plentiful in



<P>the solitary house in his clearing.&nbsp; The absence of pain and



<P>hunger was her happiness, and when she felt unhappy she was



<P>simply tired, more than usual, after the day's labour.&nbsp; Then in



<P>the hot nights of the south-west monsoon she slept dreamlessly



<P>under the bright stars on the platform built outside the house



<P>and over the river.&nbsp; Inside they slept too: Bulangi by the door;



<P>his wives further in; the children with their mothers.&nbsp; She could



<P>hear their breathing; Bulangi's sleepy voice; the sharp cry of a



<P>child soon hushed with tender words.&nbsp; And she closed her eyes to



<P>the murmur of the water below her, to the whisper of the warm



<P>wind above, ignorant of the never-ceasing life of that tropical



<P>nature that spoke to her in vain with the thousand faint voices



<P>of the near forest, with the breath of tepid wind; in the heavy



<P>scents that lingered around her head; in the white wraiths of



<P>morning mist that hung over her in the solemn hush of all



<P>creation before the dawn.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such had been her existence before the coming of the brig with



<P>the strangers.&nbsp; She remembered well that time; the uproar in the



<P>settlement, the never-ending wonder, the days and nights of talk



<P>and excitement.&nbsp; She remembered her own timidity with the strange



<P>men, till the brig moored to the bank became in a manner part of



<P>the settlement, and the fear wore off in the familiarity of



<P>constant intercourse.&nbsp; The call on board then became part of her



<P>daily round.&nbsp; She walked hesitatingly up the slanting planks of



<P>the gangway amidst the encouraging shouts and more or less decent



<P>jokes of the men idling over the bulwarks.&nbsp; There she sold her



<P>wares to those men that spoke so loud and carried themselves so



<P>free.&nbsp; There was a throng, a constant coming and going; calls



<P>interchanged, orders given and executed with shouts; the rattle



<P>of blocks, the flinging about of coils of rope.&nbsp; She sat out of



<P>the way under the shade of the awning, with her tray before her,



<P>the veil drawn well over her face, feeling shy amongst so many



<P>men.&nbsp; She smiled at all buyers, but spoke to none, letting their



<P>jests pass with stolid unconcern.&nbsp; She heard many tales told



<P>around her of far-off countries, of strange customs, of events



<P>stranger still.&nbsp; Those men were brave; but the most fearless of



<P>them spoke of their chief with fear.&nbsp; Often the man they called



<P>their master passed before her, walking erect and indifferent, in



<P>the pride of youth, in the flash of rich dress, with a tinkle of



<P>gold ornaments, while everybody stood aside watching anxiously



<P>for a movement of his lips, ready to do his bidding.&nbsp; Then all



<P>her life seemed to rush into her eyes, and from under her veil



<P>she gazed at him, charmed, yet fearful to attract attention.&nbsp; One



<P>day he noticed her and asked, "Who is that girl?"&nbsp; "A slave,



<P>Tuan!&nbsp; A girl that sells cakes," a dozen voices replied together.



<P>She rose in terror to run on shore, when he called her back; and



<P>as she stood trembling with head hung down before him, he spoke



<P>kind words, lifting her chin with his hand and looking into her



<P>eyes with a smile.&nbsp; "Do not be afraid," he said.&nbsp; He never

spoke



<P>to her any more.&nbsp; Somebody called out from the river bank; he



<P>turned away and forgot her existence.&nbsp; Taminah saw Almayer



<P>standing on the shore with Nina on his arm.&nbsp; She heard Nina's



<P>voice calling out gaily, and saw Dain's face brighten with joy as



<P>he leaped on shore.&nbsp; She hated the sound of that voice ever



<P>since.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After that day she left off visiting Almayer's compound, and



<P>passed the noon hours under the shade of the brig awning.&nbsp; She



<P>watched for his coming with heart beating quicker and quicker, as



<P>he approached, into a wild tumult of newly-aroused feelings of



<P>joy and hope and fear that died away with Dain's retreating



<P>figure, leaving her tired out, as if after a struggle, sitting



<P>still for a long time in dreamy languor.&nbsp; Then she paddled home



<P>slowly in the afternoon, often letting her canoe float with the



<P>lazy stream in the quiet backwater of the river.&nbsp; The paddle hung



<P>idle in the water as she sat in the stern, one hand supporting



<P>her chin, her eyes wide open, listening intently to the



<P>whispering of her heart that seemed to swell at last into a song



<P>of extreme sweetness.&nbsp; Listening to that song she husked the rice



<P>at home; it dulled her ears to the shrill bickerings of Bulangi's



<P>wives, to the sound of angry reproaches addressed to herself.



<P>And when the sun was near its setting she walked to the



<P>bathing-place and heard it as she stood on the tender grass of



<P>the low bank, her robe at her feet, and looked at the reflection



<P>of her figure on the glass-like surface of the creek.&nbsp; Listening



<P>to it she walked slowly back, her wet hair hanging over her



<P>shoulders; laying down to rest under the bright stars, she closed



<P>her eyes to the murmur of the water below, of the warm wind



<P>above; to the voice of nature speaking through the faint noises



<P>of the great forest, and to the song of her own heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She heard, but did not understand, and drank in the dreamy joy of



<P>her new existence without troubling about its meaning or its end,



<P>till the full consciousness of life came to her through pain and



<P>anger.&nbsp; And she suffered horribly the first time she saw Nina's



<P>long canoe drift silently past the sleeping house of Bulangi,



<P>bearing the two lovers into the white mist of the great river.



<P>Her jealousy and rage culminated into a paroxysm of physical pain



<P>that left her lying panting on the river bank, in the dumb agony



<P>of a wounded animal.&nbsp; But she went on moving patiently in the



<P>enchanted circle of slavery, going through her task day after day



<P>with all the pathos of the grief she could not express, even to



<P>herself, locked within her breast.&nbsp; She shrank from Nina as she



<P>would have shrunk from the sharp blade of a knife cutting into



<P>her flesh, but she kept on visiting the brig to feed her dumb,



<P>ignorant soul on her own despair.&nbsp; She saw Dain many times.&nbsp;

He



<P>never spoke, he never looked.&nbsp; Could his eyes see only one



<P>woman's image?&nbsp; Could his ears hear only one woman's voice?&nbsp;

He



<P>never noticed her; not once.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And then he went away.&nbsp; She saw him and Nina for the last time

on



<P>that morning when Babalatchi, while visiting his fish baskets,



<P>had his suspicions of the white man's daughter's love affair with



<P>Dain confirmed beyond the shadow of doubt.&nbsp; Dain disappeared, and



<P>Taminah's heart, where lay useless and barren the seeds of all



<P>love and of all hate, the possibilities of all passions and of



<P>all sacrifices, forgot its joys and its sufferings when deprived



<P>of the help of the senses.&nbsp; Her half-formed, savage mind, the



<P>slave of her body--as her body was the slave of another's



<P>will--forgot the faint and vague image of the ideal that had



<P>found its beginning in the physical promptings of her savage



<P>nature.&nbsp; She dropped back into the torpor of her former life and



<P>found consolation--even a certain kind of happiness--in the



<P>thought that now Nina and Dain were separated, probably for ever.



<P>He would forget.&nbsp; This thought soothed the last pangs of dying



<P>jealousy that had nothing now to feed upon, and Taminah found



<P>peace.&nbsp; It was like the dreary tranquillity of a desert, where



<P>there is peace only because there is no life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And now he had returned.&nbsp; She had recognised his voice calling



<P>aloud in the night for Bulangi.&nbsp; She had crept out after her



<P>master to listen closer to the intoxicating sound.&nbsp; Dain was



<P>there, in a boat, talking to Bulangi.&nbsp; Taminah, listening with



<P>arrested breath, heard another voice.&nbsp; The maddening joy, that



<P>only a second before she thought herself incapable of containing



<P>within her fast-beating heart, died out, and left her shivering



<P>in the old anguish of physical pain that she had suffered once



<P>before at the sight of Dain and Nina.&nbsp; Nina spoke now, ordering



<P>and entreating in turns, and Bulangi was refusing, expostulating,



<P>at last consenting.&nbsp; He went in to take a paddle from the heap



<P>lying behind the door.&nbsp; Outside the murmur of two voices went on,



<P>and she caught a word here and there.&nbsp; She understood that he was



<P>fleeing from white men, that he was seeking a hiding-place, that



<P>he was in some danger.&nbsp; But she heard also words which woke the



<P>rage of jealousy that had been asleep for so many days in her



<P>bosom.&nbsp; Crouching low on the mud in the black darkness amongst



<P>the piles, she heard the whisper in the boat that made light of



<P>toil, of privation, of danger, of life itself, if in exchange



<P>there could be but a short moment of close embrace, a look from



<P>the eyes, the feel of light breath, the touch of soft lips.&nbsp; So



<P>spoke Dain as he sat in the canoe holding Nina's hands while



<P>waiting for Bulangi's return; and Taminah, supporting herself by



<P>the slimy pile, felt as if a heavy weight was crushing her down,



<P>down into the black oily water at her feet.&nbsp; She wanted to cry



<P>out; to rush at them and tear their vague shadows apart; to throw



<P>Nina into the smooth water, cling to her close, hold her to the



<P>bottom where that man could not find her.&nbsp; She could not cry, she



<P>could not move.&nbsp; Then footsteps were heard on the bamboo platform



<P>above her head; she saw Bulangi get into his smallest canoe and



<P>take the lead, the other boat following, paddled by Dain and



<P>Nina.&nbsp; With a slight splash of the paddles dipped stealthily into



<P>the water, their indistinct forms passed before her aching eyes



<P>and vanished in the darkness of the creek.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She remained there in the cold and wet, powerless to move,



<P>breathing painfully under the crushing weight that the mysterious



<P>hand of Fate had laid so suddenly upon her slender shoulders, and



<P>shivering, she felt within a burning fire, that seemed to feed



<P>upon her very life.&nbsp; When the breaking day had spread a pale



<P>golden ribbon over the black outline of the forests, she took up



<P>her tray and departed towards the settlement, going about her



<P>task purely from the force of habit.&nbsp; As she approached Sambir



<P>she could see the excitement and she heard with momentary



<P>surprise of the finding of Dain's body.&nbsp; It was not true, of



<P>course.&nbsp; She knew it well.&nbsp; She regretted that he was not

dead.



<P>She should have liked Dain to be dead, so as to be parted from



<P>that woman--from all women.&nbsp; She felt a strong desire to see



<P>Nina, but without any clear object.&nbsp; She hated her, and feared



<P>her and she felt an irresistible impulse pushing her towards



<P>Almayer's house to see the white woman's face, to look close at



<P>those eyes, to hear again that voice, for the sound of which Dain



<P>was ready to risk his liberty, his life even.&nbsp; She had seen her



<P>many times; she had heard her voice daily for many months past.



<P>What was there in her?&nbsp; What was there in that being to make a



<P>man speak as Dain had spoken, to make him blind to all other



<P>faces, deaf to all other voices?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She left the crowd by the riverside, and wandered aimlessly among



<P>the empty houses, resisting the impulse that pushed her towards



<P>Almayer's campong to seek there in Nina's eyes the secret of her



<P>own misery.&nbsp; The sun mounting higher, shortened the shadows and



<P>poured down upon her a flood of light and of stifling heat as she



<P>passed on from shadow to light, from light to shadow, amongst the



<P>houses, the bushes, the tall trees, in her unconscious flight



<P>from the pain in her own heart.&nbsp; In the extremity of her distress



<P>she could find no words to pray for relief, she knew of no heaven



<P>to send her prayer to, and she wandered on with tired feet in the



<P>dumb surprise and terror at the injustice of the suffering



<P>inflicted upon her without cause and without redress.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The short talk with Reshid, the proposal of Abdulla steadied her



<P>a little and turned her thoughts into another channel.&nbsp; Dain was



<P>in some danger.&nbsp; He was hiding from white men.&nbsp; So much she

had



<P>overheard last night.&nbsp; They all thought him dead.&nbsp; She knew

he



<P>was alive, and she knew of his hiding-place.&nbsp; What did the Arabs



<P>want to know about the white men?&nbsp; The white men want with Dain?



<P>Did they wish to kill him?&nbsp; She could tell them all--no, she



<P>would say nothing, and in the night she would go to him and sell



<P>him his life for a word, for a smile, for a gesture even, and be



<P>his slave in far-off countries, away from Nina.&nbsp; But there were



<P>dangers.&nbsp; The one-eyed Babalatchi who knew everything; the white



<P>man's wife--she was a witch.&nbsp; Perhaps they would tell.&nbsp; And

then



<P>there was Nina.&nbsp; She must hurry on and see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In her impatience she left the path and ran towards Almayer's



<P>dwelling through the undergrowth between the palm trees.&nbsp; She



<P>came out at the back of the house, where a narrow ditch, full of



<P>stagnant water that overflowed from the river, separated



<P>Almayer's campong from the rest of the settlement.&nbsp; The thick



<P>bushes growing on the bank were hiding from her sight the large



<P>courtyard with its cooking shed.&nbsp; Above them rose several thin



<P>columns of smoke, and from behind the sound of strange voices



<P>informed Taminah that the Men of the Sea belonging to the warship



<P>had already landed and were camped between the ditch and the



<P>house.&nbsp; To the left one of Almayer's slave-girls came down to the



<P>ditch and bent over the shiny water, washing a kettle.&nbsp; To the



<P>right the tops of the banana plantation, visible above the



<P>bushes, swayed and shook under the touch of invisible hands



<P>gathering the fruit.&nbsp; On the calm water several canoes moored to



<P>a heavy stake were crowded together, nearly bridging the ditch



<P>just at the place where Taminah stood.&nbsp; The voices in the



<P>courtyard rose at times into an outburst of calls, replies, and



<P>laughter, and then died away into a silence that soon was broken



<P>again by a fresh clamour.&nbsp; Now and again the thin blue smoke



<P>rushed out thicker and blacker, and drove in odorous masses over



<P>the creek, wrapping her for a moment in a suffocating veil; then,



<P>as the fresh wood caught well alight, the smoke vanished in the



<P>bright sunlight, and only the scent of aromatic wood drifted



<P>afar, to leeward of the crackling fires.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Taminah rested her tray on a stump of a tree, and remained



<P>standing with her eyes turned towards Almayer's house, whose roof



<P>and part of a whitewashed wall were visible over the bushes.&nbsp; The



<P>slave-girl finished her work, and after looking for a while



<P>curiously at Taminah, pushed her way through the dense thicket



<P>back to the courtyard.&nbsp; Round Taminah there was now a complete



<P>solitude.&nbsp; She threw herself down on the ground, and hid her face



<P>in her hands.&nbsp; Now when so close she had no courage to see Nina.



<P>At every burst of louder voices from the courtyard she shivered



<P>in the fear of hearing Nina's voice.&nbsp; She came to the resolution



<P>of waiting where she was till dark, and then going straight to



<P>Dain's hiding-place.&nbsp; From where she was she could watch the



<P>movements of white men, of Nina, of all Dain's friends, and of



<P>all his enemies.&nbsp; Both were hateful alike to her, for both would



<P>take him away beyond her reach.&nbsp; She hid herself in the long



<P>grass to wait anxiously for the sunset that seemed so slow to



<P>come.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the other side of the ditch, behind the bush, by the clear



<P>fires, the seamen of the frigate had encamped on the hospitable



<P>invitation of Almayer.&nbsp; Almayer, roused out of his apathy by the



<P>prayers and importunity of Nina, had managed to get down in time



<P>to the jetty so as to receive the officers at their landing.&nbsp; The



<P>lieutenant in command accepted his invitation to his house with



<P>the remark that in any case their business was with Almayer--and



<P>perhaps not very pleasant, he added.&nbsp; Almayer hardly heard him.



<P>He shook hands with them absently and led the way towards the



<P>house.&nbsp; He was scarcely conscious of the polite words of welcome



<P>he greeted the strangers with, and afterwards repeated several



<P>times over again in his efforts to appear at ease.&nbsp; The agitation



<P>of their host did not escape the officer's eyes, and the chief



<P>confided to his subordinate, in a low voice, his doubts as to



<P>Almayer's sobriety.&nbsp; The young sub-lieutenant laughed and



<P>expressed in a whisper the hope that the white man was not



<P>intoxicated enough to neglect the offer of some refreshments.



<P>"He does not seem very dangerous," he added, as they followed



<P>Almayer up the steps of the verandah.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, he seems more of a fool than a knave; I have heard of him,"



<P>returned the senior.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They sat around the table.&nbsp; Almayer with shaking hands made gin



<P>cocktails, offered them all round, and drank himself, with every



<P>gulp feeling stronger, steadier, and better able to face all the



<P>difficulties of his position.&nbsp; Ignorant of the fate of the brig



<P>he did not suspect the real object of the officer's visit.&nbsp; He



<P>had a general notion that something must have leaked out about



<P>the gunpowder trade, but apprehended nothing beyond some



<P>temporary inconveniences.&nbsp; After emptying his glass he began to



<P>chat easily, lying back in his chair with one of his legs thrown



<P>negligently over the arm.&nbsp; The lieutenant astride on his chair,

a



<P>glowing cheroot in the corner of his mouth, listened with a sly



<P>smile from behind the thick volumes of smoke that escaped from



<P>his compressed lips.&nbsp; The young sub-lieutenant, leaning with both



<P>elbows on the table, his head between his hands, looked on



<P>sleepily in the torpor induced by fatigue and the gin.&nbsp; Almayer



<P>talked on--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is a great pleasure to see white faces here.&nbsp; I have lived



<P>here many years in great solitude.&nbsp; The Malays, you understand,



<P>are not company for a white man; moreover they are not friendly;



<P>they do not understand our ways.&nbsp; Great rascals they are.&nbsp;

I



<P>believe I am the only white man on the east coast that is a



<P>settled resident.&nbsp; We get visitors from Macassar or Singapore



<P>sometimes--traders, agents, or explorers, but they are rare.



<P>There was a scientific explorer here a year or more ago.&nbsp; He



<P>lived in my house:&nbsp; drank from morning to night.&nbsp; He lived



<P>joyously for a few months, and when the liquor he brought with



<P>him was gone he returned to Batavia with a report on the mineral



<P>wealth of the interior.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!&nbsp; Good, is it not?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He ceased abruptly and looked at his guests with a meaningless



<P>stare.&nbsp; While they laughed he was reciting to himself the old



<P>story: "Dain dead, all my plans destroyed.&nbsp; This is the end of



<P>all hope and of all things."&nbsp; His heart sank within him.&nbsp;

He felt



<P>a kind of deadly sickness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very good.&nbsp; Capital!" exclaimed both officers.&nbsp; Almayer came

out



<P>of his despondency with another burst of talk.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Eh! what about the dinner?&nbsp; You have got a cook with you.



<P>That's all right.&nbsp; There is a cooking shed in the other



<P>courtyard.&nbsp; I can give you a goose.&nbsp; Look at my geese--the

only



<P>geese on the east coast--perhaps on the whole island.&nbsp; Is that



<P>your cook?&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp; Here, Ali, show this Chinaman the

cooking



<P>place and tell Mem Almayer to let him have room there.&nbsp; My wife,



<P>gentlemen, does not come out; my daughter may.&nbsp; Meantime have



<P>some more drink.&nbsp; It is a hot day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The lieutenant took the cigar out of his mouth, looked at the ash



<P>critically, shook it off and turned towards Almayer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We have a rather unpleasant business with you," he said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am sorry," returned Almayer.&nbsp; "It can be nothing very serious,



<P>surely."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you think an attempt to blow up forty men at least, not a



<P>serious matter you will not find many people of your opinion,"



<P>retorted the officer sharply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Blow up!&nbsp; What?&nbsp; I know nothing about it" exclaimed Almayer.



<P>"Who did that, or tried to do it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A man with whom you had some dealings," answered the lieutenant.



<P>"He passed here under the name of Dain Maroola.&nbsp; You sold him the



<P>gunpowder he had in that brig we captured."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How did you hear about the brig?" asked Almayer.&nbsp; "I know



<P>nothing about the powder he may have had."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"An Arab trader of this place has sent the information about your



<P>goings on here to Batavia, a couple of months ago," said the



<P>officer.&nbsp; "We were waiting for the brig outside, but he slipped



<P>past us at the mouth of the river, and we had to chase the fellow



<P>to the southward.&nbsp; When he sighted us he ran inside the reefs and



<P>put the brig ashore.&nbsp; The crew escaped in boats before we could



<P>take possession.&nbsp; As our boats neared the craft it blew up with

a



<P>tremendous explosion; one of the boats being too near got



<P>swamped.&nbsp; Two men drowned--that is the result of your



<P>speculation, Mr. Almayer.&nbsp; Now we want this Dain.&nbsp; We have

good



<P>grounds to suppose he is hiding in Sambir.&nbsp; Do you know

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>where he is?&nbsp; You had better put yourself right with the



<P>authorities as much as possible by being perfectly frank with me.



<P>Where is this Dain?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer got up and walked towards the balustrade of the verandah.



<P>He seemed not to be thinking of the officer's question.&nbsp; He



<P>looked at the body laying straight and rigid under its white



<P>cover on which the sun, declining amongst the clouds to the



<P>westward, threw a pale tinge of red.&nbsp; The lieutenant waited for



<P>the answer, taking quick pulls at his half-extinguished cigar.



<P>Behind them Ali moved noiselessly laying the table, ranging



<P>solemnly the ill-assorted and shabby crockery, the tin spoons,



<P>the forks with broken prongs, and the knives with saw-like blades



<P>and loose handles.&nbsp; He had almost forgotten how to prepare the



<P>table for white men.&nbsp; He felt aggrieved; Mem Nina would not help



<P>him.&nbsp; He stepped back to look at his work admiringly, feeling



<P>very proud.&nbsp; This must be right; and if the master afterwards is



<P>angry and swears, then so much the worse for Mem Nina.&nbsp; Why did



<P>she not help?&nbsp; He left the verandah to fetch the dinner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Mr. Almayer, will you answer my question as frankly as it



<P>is put to you?" asked the lieutenant, after a long silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer turned round and looked at his interlocutor steadily.



<P>"If you catch this Dain what will you do with him?" he asked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The officer's face flushed.&nbsp; "This is not an answer," he said,



<P>annoyed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And what will you do with me?" went on Almayer, not heeding the



<P>interruption.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you inclined to bargain?" growled the other.&nbsp; "It would be



<P>bad policy, I assure you.&nbsp; At present I have no orders about your



<P>person, but we expected your assistance in catching this Malay."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!" interrupted Almayer, "just so: you can do nothing without



<P>me, and I, knowing the man well, am to help you in finding him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is exactly what we expect," assented the officer.&nbsp; "You



<P>have broken the law, Mr. Almayer, and you ought to make amends."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And save myself?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, in a sense yes.&nbsp; Your head is not in any danger," said the



<P>lieutenant, with a short laugh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well," said Almayer, with decision, "I shall deliver the



<P>man up to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Both officers rose to their feet quickly, and looked for their



<P>side-arms which they had unbuckled.&nbsp; Almayer laughed harshly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Steady, gentlemen!" he exclaimed.&nbsp; "In my own time and in my own



<P>way.&nbsp; After dinner, gentlemen, you shall have him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is preposterous," urged the lieutenant.&nbsp; "Mr. Almayer, this



<P>is no joking matter.&nbsp; The man is a criminal.&nbsp; He deserves

to



<P>hang.&nbsp; While we dine he may escape; the rumour of our arrival--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer walked towards the table.&nbsp; "I give you my word of honour,



<P>gentlemen, that he shall not escape; I have him safe enough."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The arrest should be effected before dark," remarked the young



<P>sub.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall hold you responsible for any failure.&nbsp; We are ready, but



<P>can do nothing just now without you," added the senior, with



<P>evident annoyance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer made a gesture of assent.&nbsp; "On my word of honour," he



<P>repeated vaguely.&nbsp; "And now let us dine," he added briskly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina came through the doorway and stood for a moment holding the



<P>curtain aside for Ali and the old Malay woman bearing the dishes;



<P>then she moved towards the three men by the table.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Allow me," said Almayer, pompously.&nbsp; "This is my daughter.



<P>Nina, these gentlemen, officers of the frigate outside, have done



<P>me the honour to accept my hospitality."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina answered the low bows of the two officers by a slow



<P>inclination of the head and took her place at the table opposite



<P>her father.&nbsp; All sat down.&nbsp; The coxswain of the steam launch

came



<P>up carrying some bottles of wine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will allow me to have this put upon the table?" said the



<P>lieutenant to Almayer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What! Wine! You are very kind.&nbsp; Certainly, I have none myself.



<P>Times are very hard."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The last words of his reply were spoken by Almayer in a faltering



<P>voice.&nbsp; The thought that Dain was dead recurred to him vividly



<P>again, and he felt as if an invisible hand was gripping his



<P>throat.&nbsp; He reached for the gin bottle while they were uncorking



<P>the wine and swallowed a big gulp.&nbsp; The lieutenant, who was



<P>speaking to Nina, gave him a quick glance.&nbsp; The young sub began



<P>to recover from the astonishment and confusion caused by Nina's



<P>unexpected appearance and great beauty.&nbsp; "She was very beautiful



<P>and imposing," he reflected, "but after all a half-caste girl."



<P>This thought caused him to pluck up heart and look at Nina



<P>sideways.&nbsp; Nina, with composed face, was answering in a low, even



<P>voice the elder officer's polite questions as to the country and



<P>her mode of life.&nbsp; Almayer pushed his plate away and drank his



<P>guest's wine in gloomy silence.

<P>"Can I believe what you tell me? It is like a tale for men that



<P>listen only half awake by the camp fire, and it seems to have run



<P>off a woman's tongue."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who is there here for me to deceive, O Rajah?" answered



<P>Babalatchi.&nbsp; "Without you I am nothing.&nbsp; All I have told you

I



<P>believe to be true.&nbsp; I have been safe for many years in the



<P>hollow of your hand.&nbsp; This is no time to harbour suspicions.&nbsp;

The



<P>danger is very great.&nbsp; We should advise and act at once, before



<P>the sun sets."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Right.&nbsp; Right," muttered Lakamba, pensively.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They had been sitting for the last hour together in the audience



<P>chamber of the Rajah's house, for Babalatchi, as soon as he had



<P>witnessed the landing of the Dutch officers, had crossed the



<P>river to report to his master the events of the morning, and to



<P>confer with him upon the line of conduct to pursue in the face of



<P>altered circumstances.&nbsp; They were both puzzled and frightened by



<P>the unexpected turn the events had taken.&nbsp; The Rajah, sitting



<P>crosslegged on his chair, looked fixedly at the floor; Babalatchi



<P>was squatting close by in an attitude of deep dejection.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And where did you say he is hiding now?" asked Lakamba, breaking



<P>at last the silence full of gloomy forebodings in which they both



<P>had been lost for a long while.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"In Bulangi's clearing--the furthest one, away from the house.



<P>They went there that very night.&nbsp; The white man's daughter took



<P>him there.&nbsp; She told me so herself, speaking to me openly, for



<P>she is half white and has no decency.&nbsp; She said she was waiting



<P>for him while he was here; then, after a long time, he came out



<P>of the darkness and fell at her feet exhausted.&nbsp; He lay like one



<P>dead, but she brought him back to life in her arms, and made him



<P>breathe again with her own breath.&nbsp; That is what she said,



<P>speaking to my face, as I am speaking now to you, Rajah.&nbsp; She is



<P>like a white woman and knows no shame."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He paused, deeply shocked.&nbsp; Lakamba nodded his head.&nbsp; "Well,

and



<P>then?" he asked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They called the old woman," went on Babalatchi, "and he told



<P>them all--about the brig, and how he tried to kill many men.&nbsp; He



<P>knew the Orang Blanda were very near, although he had said



<P>nothing to us about that; he knew his great danger.&nbsp; He thought



<P>he had killed many, but there were only two dead, as I have heard



<P>from the men of the sea that came in the warship's boats."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And the other man, he that was found in the river?" interrupted



<P>Lakamba.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That was one of his boatmen.&nbsp; When his canoe was overturned by



<P>the logs those two swam together, but the other man must have



<P>been hurt.&nbsp; Dain swam, holding him up.&nbsp; He left him in the

bushes



<P>when he went up to the house.&nbsp; When they all came down his heart



<P>had ceased to beat; then the old woman spoke; Dain thought it was



<P>good.&nbsp; He took off his anklet and broke it, twisting it round the



<P>man's foot.&nbsp; His ring he put on that slave's hand.&nbsp; He took

off



<P>his sarong and clothed that thing that wanted no clothes, the two



<P>women holding it up meanwhile, their intent being to deceive all



<P>eyes and to mislead the minds in the settlement, so that they



<P>could swear to the thing that was not, and that there could be no



<P>treachery when the white-men came.&nbsp; Then Dain and the white woman



<P>departed to call up Bulangi and find a hiding-place.&nbsp; The old



<P>woman remained by the body."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hai!" exclaimed Lakamba.&nbsp; "She has wisdom."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, she has a Devil of her own to whisper counsel in her ear,"



<P>assented Babalatchi.&nbsp; "She dragged the body with great toil to



<P>the point where many logs were stranded.&nbsp; All these things were



<P>done in the darkness after the storm had passed away.&nbsp; Then she



<P>waited.&nbsp; At the first sign of daylight she battered the face of



<P>the dead with a heavy stone, and she pushed him amongst the logs.



<P>She remained near, watching.&nbsp; At sunrise Mahmat Banjer came and



<P>found him.&nbsp; They all believed; I myself was deceived, but not for



<P>long.&nbsp; The white man believed, and, grieving, fled to his house.



<P>When we were alone I, having doubts, spoke to the woman, and she,



<P>fearing my anger and your might, told me all, asking for help in



<P>saving Dain."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He must not fall into the hands of the Orang Blanda," said



<P>Lakamba; "but let him die, if the thing can be done quietly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It cannot, Tuan!&nbsp; Remember there is that woman who, being half



<P>white, is ungovernable, and would raise a great outcry.&nbsp; Also the



<P>officers are here.&nbsp; They are angry enough already.&nbsp; Dain must



<P>escape; he must go.&nbsp; We must help him now for our own safety."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are the officers very angry?" inquired Lakamba, with interest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They are.&nbsp; The principal chief used strong words when speaking



<P>to me--to me when I salaamed in your name.&nbsp; I do not think,"



<P>added Babalatchi, after a short pause and looking very



<P>worried--"I do not think I saw a white chief so angry before.&nbsp;

He



<P>said we were careless or even worse.&nbsp; He told me he would speak



<P>to the Rajah, and that I was of no account."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Speak to the Rajah!" repeated Lakamba, thoughtfully.&nbsp; "Listen,



<P>Babalatchi: I am sick, and shall withdraw; you cross over and



<P>tell the white men."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Babalatchi, "I am going over at once; and as to



<P>Dain?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You get him away as you can best.&nbsp; This is a great trouble in

my



<P>heart," sighed Lakamba.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi got up, and, going close to his master, spoke



<P>earnestly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is one of our praus at the southern mouth of the river.



<P>The Dutch warship is to the northward watching the main entrance.



<P>I shall send Dain off to-night in a canoe, by the hidden



<P>channels, on board the prau.&nbsp; His father is a great prince, and



<P>shall hear of our generosity.&nbsp; Let the prau take him to Ampanam.



<P>Your glory shall be great, and your reward in powerful



<P>friendship.&nbsp; Almayer will no doubt deliver the dead body as



<P>Dain's to the officers, and the foolish white men shall say,



<P>'This is very good; let there be peace.' And the trouble shall be



<P>removed from your heart, Rajah."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"True! true!" said Lakamba.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And, this being accomplished by me who am your slave, you shall



<P>reward with a generous hand.&nbsp; That I know!&nbsp; The white man

is



<P>grieving for the lost treasure, in the manner of white men who



<P>thirst after dollars.&nbsp; Now, when all other things are in order,



<P>we shall perhaps obtain the treasure from the white man.&nbsp; Dain



<P>must escape, and Almayer must live."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now go, Babalatchi, go!" said Lakamba, getting off his chair.



<P>"I am very sick, and want medicine.&nbsp; Tell the white chief so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Babalatchi was not to be got rid of in this summary manner.



<P>He knew that his master, after the manner of the great, liked to



<P>shift the burden of toil and danger on to his servants'



<P>shoulders, but in the difficult straits in which they were now



<P>the Rajah must play his part.&nbsp; He may be very sick for the white



<P>men, for all the world if he liked, as long as he would take upon



<P>himself the execution of part at least of Babalatchi's carefully



<P>thought-of plan.&nbsp; Babalatchi wanted a big canoe manned by twelve



<P>men to be sent out after dark towards Bulangi's clearing.&nbsp; Dain



<P>may have to be overpowered.&nbsp; A man in love cannot be expected to



<P>see clearly the path of safety if it leads him away from the



<P>object of his affections, argued Babalatchi, and in that case



<P>they would have to use force in order to make him go.&nbsp; Would the



<P>Rajah see that trusty men manned the canoe?&nbsp; The thing must be



<P>done secretly.&nbsp; Perhaps the Rajah would come himself, so as to



<P>bring all the weight of his authority to bear upon Dain if he



<P>should prove obstinate and refuse to leave his hiding-place.&nbsp; The



<P>Rajah would not commit himself to a definite promise, and



<P>anxiously pressed Babalatchi to go, being afraid of the white men



<P>paying him an unexpected visit.&nbsp; The aged statesman reluctantly



<P>took his leave and went into the courtyard.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before going down to his boat Babalatchi stopped for a while in



<P>the big open space where the thick-leaved trees put black patches



<P>of shadow which seemed to float on a flood of smooth, intense



<P>light that rolled up to the houses and down to the stockade and



<P>over the river, where it broke and sparkled in thousands of



<P>glittering wavelets, like a band woven of azure and gold edged



<P>with the brilliant green of the forests guarding both banks of



<P>the Pantai.&nbsp; In the perfect calm before the coming of the



<P>afternoon breeze the irregularly jagged line of tree-tops stood



<P>unchanging, as if traced by an unsteady hand on the clear blue of



<P>the hot sky.&nbsp; In the space sheltered by the high palisades there



<P>lingered the smell of decaying blossoms from the surrounding



<P>forest, a taint of drying fish; with now and then a whiff of



<P>acrid smoke from the cooking fires when it eddied down from under



<P>the leafy boughs and clung lazily about the burnt-up grass.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Babalatchi looked up at the flagstaff over-topping a group of



<P>low trees in the middle of the courtyard, the tricolour flag of



<P>the Netherlands stirred slightly for the first time since it had



<P>been hoisted that morning on the arrival of the man-of-war boats.



<P>With a faint rustle of trees the breeze came down in light puffs,



<P>playing capriciously for a time with this emblem of Lakamba's



<P>power, that was also the mark of his servitude; then the breeze



<P>freshened in a sharp gust of wind, and the flag flew out straight



<P>and steady above the trees.&nbsp; A dark shadow ran along the river,



<P>rolling over and covering up the sparkle of declining sunlight.



<P>A big white cloud sailed slowly across the darkening sky, and



<P>hung to the westward as if waiting for the sun to join it there.



<P>Men and things shook off the torpor of the hot afternoon and



<P>stirred into life under the first breath of the sea breeze.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi hurried down to the water-gate; yet before he passed



<P>through it he paused to look round the courtyard, with its light



<P>and shade, with its cheery fires, with the groups of Lakamba's



<P>soldiers and retainers scattered about.&nbsp; His own house stood



<P>amongst the other buildings in that enclosure, and the statesman



<P>of Sambir asked himself with a sinking heart when and how would



<P>it be given him to return to that house.&nbsp; He had to deal with a



<P>man more dangerous than any wild beast of his experience: a proud



<P>man, a man wilful after the manner of princes, a man in love.



<P>And he was going forth to speak to that man words of cold and



<P>worldly wisdom.&nbsp; Could anything be more appalling?&nbsp; What if

that



<P>man should take umbrage at some fancied slight to his honour or



<P>disregard of his affections and suddenly "amok"?&nbsp; The wise



<P>adviser would be the first victim, no doubt, and death would be



<P>his reward.&nbsp; And underlying the horror of this situation there



<P>was the danger of those meddlesome fools, the white men.&nbsp; A



<P>vision of comfortless exile in far-off Madura rose up before



<P>Babalatchi.&nbsp; Wouldn't that be worse than death itself?&nbsp; And

there



<P>was that half-white woman with threatening eyes.&nbsp; How could he



<P>tell what an incomprehensible creature of that sort would or



<P>would not do?&nbsp; She knew so much that she made the killing of Dain



<P>an impossibility.&nbsp; That much was certain.&nbsp; And yet the sharp,



<P>rough-edged kriss is a good and discreet friend, thought



<P>Babalatchi, as he examined his own lovingly, and put it back in



<P>the sheath, with a sigh of regret, before unfastening his canoe.



<P>As he cast off the painter, pushed out into the stream, and took



<P>up his paddle, he realised vividly how unsatisfactory it was to



<P>have women mixed up in state affairs.&nbsp; Young women, of course.



<P>For Mrs. Almayer's mature wisdom, and for the easy aptitude in



<P>intrigue that comes with years to the feminine mind, he felt the



<P>most sincere respect.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He paddled leisurely, letting the canoe drift down as he crossed



<P>towards the point.&nbsp; The sun was high yet, and nothing pressed.



<P>His work would commence only with the coming of darkness.



<P>Avoiding the Lingard jetty, he rounded the point, and paddled up



<P>the creek at the back of Almayer's house.&nbsp; There were many canoes



<P>lying there, their noses all drawn together, fastened all to the



<P>same stake.&nbsp; Babalatchi pushed his little craft in amongst them



<P>and stepped on shore.&nbsp; On the other side of the ditch something



<P>moved in the grass.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who's that hiding?" hailed Babalatchi.&nbsp; "Come out and speak to



<P>me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nobody answered.&nbsp; Babalatchi crossed over, passing from boat to



<P>boat, and poked his staff viciously in the suspicious place.



<P>Taminah jumped up with a cry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What are you doing here?" he asked, surprised.&nbsp; "I have nearly



<P>stepped on your tray.&nbsp; Am I a Dyak that you should hide at my



<P>sight?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was weary, and--I slept," whispered Taminah, confusedly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You slept! You have not sold anything to-day, and you will be



<P>beaten when you return home," said Babalatchi.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Taminah stood before him abashed and silent.&nbsp; Babalatchi looked



<P>her over carefully with great satisfaction.&nbsp; Decidedly he would



<P>offer fifty dollars more to that thief Bulangi.&nbsp; The girl pleased



<P>him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now you go home.&nbsp; It is late," he said sharply.&nbsp; "Tell Bulangi



<P>that I shall be near his house before the night is half over, and



<P>that I want him to make all things ready for a long journey.&nbsp; You



<P>understand?&nbsp; A long journey to the southward.&nbsp; Tell him that



<P>before sunset, and do not forget my words."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Taminah made a gesture of assent, and watched Babalatchi recross



<P>the ditch and disappear through the bushes bordering Almayer's



<P>compound.&nbsp; She moved a little further off the creek and sank in



<P>the grass again, lying down on her face, shivering in dry-eyed



<P>misery.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi walked straight towards the cooking-shed looking for



<P>Mrs. Almayer.&nbsp; The courtyard was in a great uproar.&nbsp; A strange



<P>Chinaman had possession of the kitchen fire and was noisily



<P>demanding another saucepan.&nbsp; He hurled objurgations, in the



<P>Canton dialect and bad Malay, against the group of slave-girls



<P>standing a little way off, half frightened, half amused, at his



<P>violence.&nbsp; From the camping fires round which the seamen of the



<P>frigate were sitting came words of encouragement, mingled with



<P>laughter and jeering.&nbsp; In the midst of this noise and confusion



<P>Babalatchi met Ali, an empty dish in his hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where are the white men?" asked Babalatchi.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They are eating in the front verandah," answered Ali.&nbsp; "Do not



<P>stop me, Tuan.&nbsp; I am giving the white men their food and am



<P>busy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where's Mem Almayer?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Inside in the passage.&nbsp; She is listening to the talk."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ali grinned and passed on; Babalatchi ascended the plankway to



<P>the rear verandah, and beckoning out Mrs. Almayer, engaged her in



<P>earnest conversation.&nbsp; Through the long passage, closed at the



<P>further end by the red curtain, they could hear from time to time



<P>Almayer's voice mingling in conversation with an abrupt loudness



<P>that made Mrs. Almayer look significantly at Babalatchi.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Listen," she said.&nbsp; "He has drunk much."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He has," whispered Babalatchi.&nbsp; "He will sleep heavily



<P>to-night."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Almayer looked doubtful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sometimes the devil of strong gin makes him keep awake, and he



<P>walks up and down the verandah all night, cursing; then we stand



<P>afar off," explained Mrs. Almayer, with the fuller knowledge born



<P>of twenty odd years of married life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But then he does not hear, nor understand, and his hand, of



<P>course, has no strength.&nbsp; We do not want him to hear to-night."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," assented Mrs. Almayer, energetically, but in a cautiously



<P>subdued voice.&nbsp; "If he hears he will kill."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi looked incredulous.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hai Tuan, you may believe me.&nbsp; Have I not lived many years with



<P>that man?&nbsp; Have I not seen death in that man's eyes more than



<P>once when I was younger and he guessed at many things.&nbsp; Had he



<P>been a man of my own people I would not have seen such a look



<P>twice; but he--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With a contemptuous gesture she seemed to fling unutterable scorn



<P>on Almayer's weak-minded aversion to sudden bloodshed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If he has the wish but not the strength, then what do we fear?"



<P>asked Babalatchi, after a short silence during which they both



<P>listened to Almayer's loud talk till it subsided into the murmur



<P>of general conversation.&nbsp; "What do we fear?" repeated Babalatchi



<P>again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To keep the daughter whom he loves he would strike into your



<P>heart and mine without hesitation," said Mrs. Almayer.&nbsp; "When the



<P>girl is gone he will be like the devil unchained.&nbsp; Then you and

I



<P>had better beware."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am an old man and fear not death," answered Babalatchi, with a



<P>mendacious assumption of indifference.&nbsp; "But what will you do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am an old woman, and wish to live," retorted Mrs. Almayer.



<P>"She is my daughter also.&nbsp; I shall seek safety at the feet of our



<P>Rajah, speaking in the name of the past when we both were young,



<P>and he--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi raised his hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Enough.&nbsp; You shall be protected," he said soothingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Again the sound of Almayer's voice was heard, and again



<P>interrupting their talk, they listened to the confused but loud



<P>utterance coming in bursts of unequal strength, with unexpected



<P>pauses and noisy repetitions that made some words and sentences



<P>fall clear and distinct on their ears out of the meaningless



<P>jumble of excited shoutings emphasised by the thumping of



<P>Almayer's fist upon the table.&nbsp; On the short intervals of



<P>silence, the high complaining note of tumblers, standing close



<P>together and vibrating to the shock, lingered, growing fainter,



<P>till it leapt up again into tumultuous ringing, when a new idea



<P>started a new rush of words and brought down the heavy hand



<P>again.&nbsp; At last the quarrelsome shouting ceased, and the thin



<P>plaint of disturbed glass died away into reluctant quietude.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi and Mrs. Almayer had listened curiously, their bodies



<P>bent and their ears turned towards the passage.&nbsp; At every louder



<P>shout they nodded at each other with a ridiculous affectation of



<P>scandalised propriety, and they remained in the same attitude for



<P>some time after the noise had ceased.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is the devil of gin," whispered Mrs. Almayer.&nbsp; "Yes; he



<P>talks like that sometimes when there is nobody to hear him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What does he say?" inquired Babalatchi, eagerly.&nbsp; "You ought to



<P>understand."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have forgotten their talk.&nbsp; A little I understood.&nbsp; He

spoke



<P>without any respect of the white ruler in Batavia, and of



<P>protection, and said he had been wronged; he said that several



<P>times.&nbsp; More I did not understand.&nbsp; Listen!&nbsp; Again he

speaks!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tse! tse! tse!" clicked Babalatchi, trying to appear shocked,



<P>but with a joyous twinkle of his solitary eye.&nbsp; "There will be



<P>great trouble between those white men.&nbsp; I will go round now and



<P>see.&nbsp; You tell your daughter that there is a sudden and a long



<P>journey before her, with much glory and splendour at the end.



<P>And tell her that Dain must go, or he must die, and that he will



<P>not go alone."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, he will not go alone," slowly repeated Mrs. Almayer, with a



<P>thoughtful air, as she crept into the passage after seeing



<P>Babalatchi disappear round the corner of the house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The statesman of Sambir, under the impulse of vivid curiosity,



<P>made his way quickly to the front of the house, but once there he



<P>moved slowly and cautiously as he crept step by step up the



<P>stairs of the verandah.&nbsp; On the highest step he sat down quietly,



<P>his feet on the steps below, ready for flight should his presence



<P>prove unwelcome.&nbsp; He felt pretty safe so.&nbsp; The table stood

nearly



<P>endways to him, and he saw Almayer's back; at Nina he looked full



<P>face, and had a side view of both officers; but of the four



<P>persons sitting at the table only Nina and the younger officer



<P>noticed his noiseless arrival.&nbsp; The momentary dropping of Nina's



<P>eyelids acknowledged Babalatchi's presence; she then spoke at



<P>once to the young sub, who turned towards her with attentive



<P>alacrity, but her gaze was fastened steadily on her father's face



<P>while Almayer was speaking uproariously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>" . . . disloyalty and unscrupulousness!&nbsp; What have you ever done



<P>to make me loyal?&nbsp; You have no grip on this country.&nbsp; I had

to



<P>take care of myself, and when I asked for protection I was met



<P>with threats and contempt, and had Arab slander thrown in my



<P>face.&nbsp; I! a white man!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't be violent, Almayer," remonstrated the lieutenant; "I have



<P>heard all this already."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then why do you talk to me about scruples?&nbsp; I wanted money, and



<P>I gave powder in exchange.&nbsp; How could I know that some of your



<P>wretched men were going to be blown up?&nbsp; Scruples!&nbsp; Pah!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He groped unsteadily amongst the bottles, trying one after



<P>another, grumbling to himself the while.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No more wine," he muttered discontentedly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have had enough, Almayer," said the lieutenant, as he



<P>lighted a cigar.&nbsp; "Is it not time to deliver to us your prisoner?



<P>I take it you have that Dain Maroola stowed away safely



<P>somewhere.&nbsp; Still we had better get that business over, and then



<P>we shall have more drink.&nbsp; Come! don't look at me like this."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer was staring with stony eyes, his trembling fingers



<P>fumbling about his throat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gold," he said with difficulty.&nbsp; "Hem!&nbsp; A hand on the windpipe,



<P>you know.&nbsp; Sure you will excuse.&nbsp; I wanted to say--a little

gold



<P>for a little powder.&nbsp; What's that?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know, I know," said the lieutenant soothingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No! You don't know.&nbsp; Not one of you knows!" shouted Almayer.



<P>"The government is a fool, I tell you.&nbsp; Heaps of gold.&nbsp; I

am the



<P>man that knows; I and another one.&nbsp; But he won't speak.&nbsp; He

is--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He checked himself with a feeble smile, and, making an



<P>unsuccessful attempt to pat the officer on the shoulder, knocked



<P>over a couple of empty bottles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Personally you are a fine fellow," he said very distinctly, in a



<P>patronising manner.&nbsp; His head nodded drowsily as he sat muttering



<P>to himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The two officers looked at each other helplessly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This won't do," said the lieutenant, addressing his junior.



<P>"Have the men mustered in the compound here.&nbsp; I must get some



<P>sense out of him.&nbsp; Hi!&nbsp; Almayer! Wake up, man.&nbsp; Redeem

your word.



<P>You gave your word.&nbsp; You gave your word of honour, you know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer shook off the officer's hand with impatience, but his



<P>ill-humour vanished at once, and he looked up, putting his



<P>forefinger to the side of his nose.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are very young; there is time for all things," he said, with



<P>an air of great sagacity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The lieutenant turned towards Nina, who, leaning back in her



<P>chair, watched her father steadily.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Really I am very much distressed by all this for your sake," he



<P>exclaimed.&nbsp; "I do not know;" he went on, speaking with some



<P>embarrassment, "whether I have any right to ask you anything,



<P>unless, perhaps, to withdraw from this painful scene, but I feel



<P>that I must--for your father's good--suggest that you should--I



<P>mean if you have any influence over him you ought to exert it now



<P>to make him keep the promise he gave me before he--before he got



<P>into this state."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He observed with discouragement that she seemed not to take any



<P>notice of what he said sitting still with half-closed eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I trust--" he began again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is the promise you speak of?" abruptly asked Nina, leaving



<P>her seat and moving towards her father.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing that is not just and proper.&nbsp; He promised to deliver to



<P>us a man who in time of profound peace took the lives of innocent



<P>men to escape the punishment he deserved for breaking the law.



<P>He planned his mischief on a large scale.&nbsp; It is not his fault

if



<P>it failed, partially.&nbsp; Of course you have heard of Dain Maroola.



<P>Your father secured him, I understand.&nbsp; We know he escaped up



<P>this river.&nbsp; Perhaps you--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And he killed white men!" interrupted Nina.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I regret to say they were white.&nbsp; Yes, two white men lost their



<P>lives through that scoundrel's freak."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Two only!" exclaimed Nina.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The officer looked at her in amazement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why! why! You- " he stammered, confused.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There might have been more," interrupted Nina.&nbsp; "And when you



<P>get this--this scoundrel will you go?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The lieutenant, still speechless, bowed his assent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then I would get him for you if I had to seek him in a burning



<P>fire," she burst out with intense energy.&nbsp; "I hate the sight of



<P>your white faces.&nbsp; I hate the sound of your gentle voices.&nbsp;

That



<P>is the way you speak to women, dropping sweet words before any



<P>pretty face.&nbsp; I have heard your voices before.&nbsp; I hoped to

live



<P>here without seeing any other white face but this," she added in



<P>a gentler tone, touching lightly her father's cheek.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer ceased his mumbling and opened his eyes.&nbsp; He caught hold



<P>of his daughter's hand and pressed it to his face, while Nina



<P>with the other hand smoothed his rumpled grey hair, looking



<P>defiantly over her father's head at the officer, who had now



<P>regained his composure and returned her look with a cool, steady



<P>stare.&nbsp; Below, in front of the verandah, they could hear the



<P>tramp of seamen mustering there according to orders.&nbsp; The



<P>sub-lieutenant came up the steps, while Babalatchi stood up



<P>uneasily and, with finger on lip, tried to catch Nina's eye.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are a good girl," whispered Almayer, absently, dropping his



<P>daughter's hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Father! father!" she cried, bending over him with passionate



<P>entreaty.&nbsp; "See those two men looking at us.&nbsp; Send them away.&nbsp;

I



<P>cannot bear it any more.&nbsp; Send them away.&nbsp; Do what they want

and



<P>let them go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She caught sight of Babalatchi and ceased speaking suddenly, but



<P>her foot tapped the floor with rapid beats in a paroxysm of



<P>nervous restlessness.&nbsp; The two officers stood close together



<P>looking on curiously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What has happened?&nbsp; What is the matter?" whispered the younger



<P>man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't know," answered the other, under his breath.&nbsp; "One is



<P>furious, and the other is drunk.&nbsp; Not so drunk, either.&nbsp; Queer,



<P>this.&nbsp; Look!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer had risen, holding on to his daughter's arm.&nbsp; He



<P>hesitated a moment, then he let go his hold and lurched half-way



<P>across the verandah.&nbsp; There he pulled himself together, and stood



<P>very straight, breathing hard and glaring round angrily.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are the men ready?" asked the lieutenant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All ready, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, Mr. Almayer, lead the way," said the lieutenant

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer rested his eyes on him as if he saw him for the first



<P>time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Two men," he said thickly.&nbsp; The effort of speaking seemed to



<P>interfere with his equilibrium.&nbsp; He took a quick step to save



<P>himself from a fall, and remained swaying backwards and forwards.



<P>"Two men," he began again, speaking with difficulty.&nbsp; "Two white



<P>men--men in uniform--honourable men.&nbsp; I want to say--men of



<P>honour.&nbsp; Are you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come! None of that," said the officer impatiently.&nbsp; "Let us have



<P>that friend of yours."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What do you think I am?" asked Almayer, fiercely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are drunk, but not so drunk as not to know what you are



<P>doing.&nbsp; Enough of this tomfoolery," said the officer sternly, "or



<P>I will have you put under arrest in your own house."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Arrest!" laughed Almayer, discordantly.&nbsp; "Ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; Arrest!



<P>Why, I have been trying to get out of this infernal place for



<P>twenty years, and I can't.&nbsp; You hear, man! I can't, and never



<P>shall!&nbsp; Never!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He ended his words with a sob, and walked unsteadily down the



<P>stairs.&nbsp; When in the courtyard the lieutenant approached him, and



<P>took him by the arm.&nbsp; The sub-lieutenant and Babalatchi followed



<P>close.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's better, Almayer," said the officer encouragingly.&nbsp; "Where



<P>are you going to?&nbsp; There are only planks there.&nbsp; Here," he

went



<P>on, shaking him slightly, "do we want the boats?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," answered Almayer, viciously.&nbsp; "You want a grave."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What?&nbsp; Wild again!&nbsp; Try to talk sense."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Grave!" roared Almayer, struggling to get himself free.&nbsp; "A hole



<P>in the ground.&nbsp; Don't you understand?&nbsp; You must be drunk.&nbsp;

Let me



<P>go!&nbsp; Let go, I tell you!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He tore away from the officer's grasp, and reeled towards the



<P>planks where the body lay under its white cover; then he turned



<P>round quickly, and faced the semicircle of interested faces.&nbsp; The



<P>sun was sinking rapidly, throwing long shadows of house and trees



<P>over the courtyard, but the light lingered yet on the river,



<P>where the logs went drifting past in midstream, looking very



<P>distinct and black in the pale red glow.&nbsp; The trunks of the trees



<P>in the forest on the east bank were lost in gloom while their



<P>highest branches swayed gently in the departing sunlight.&nbsp; The



<P>air felt heavy and cold in the breeze, expiring in slight puffs



<P>that came over the water.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer shivered as he made an effort to speak, and again with an



<P>uncertain gesture he seemed to free his throat from the grip of



<P>an invisible hand.&nbsp; His bloodshot eyes wandered aimlessly from



<P>face to face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There!" he said at last.&nbsp; "Are you all there?&nbsp; He is a dangerous



<P>man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He dragged at the cover with hasty violence, and the body rolled



<P>stiffly off the planks and fell at his feet in rigid



<P>helplessness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Cold, perfectly cold," said Almayer, looking round with a



<P>mirthless smile.&nbsp; "Sorry can do no better.&nbsp; And you can't

hang



<P>him, either.&nbsp; As you observe, gentlemen," he added gravely,



<P>"there is no head, and hardly any neck."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The last ray of light was snatched away from the tree-tops, the



<P>river grew suddenly dark, and in the great stillness the murmur



<P>of the flowing water seemed to fill the vast expanse of grey



<P>shadow that descended upon the land.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is Dain," went on Almayer to the silent group that



<P>surrounded him.&nbsp; "And I have kept my word.&nbsp; First one hope,

then



<P>another, and this is my last.&nbsp; Nothing is left now.&nbsp; You think



<P>there is one dead man here?&nbsp; Mistake, I 'sure you.&nbsp; I am much



<P>more dead.&nbsp; Why don't you hang me?" he suggested suddenly, in a



<P>friendly tone, addressing the lieutenant.&nbsp; "I assure, assure you



<P>it would be a mat--matter of form altog--altogether."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These last words he muttered to himself, and walked zigzaging



<P>towards his house.&nbsp; "Get out!" he thundered at Ali, who was



<P>approaching timidly with offers of assistance.&nbsp; From afar, scared



<P>groups of men and women watched his devious progress.&nbsp; He dragged



<P>himself up the stairs by the banister, and managed to reach a



<P>chair into which he fell heavily.&nbsp; He sat for awhile panting with



<P>exertion and anger, and looking round vaguely for Nina; then



<P>making a threatening gesture towards the compound, where he had



<P>heard Babalatchi's voice, he overturned the table with his foot



<P>in a great crash of smashed crockery.&nbsp; He muttered yet menacingly



<P>to himself, then his head fell on his breast, his eyes closed,



<P>and with a deep sigh he fell asleep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That night--for the first time in its history--the peaceful and



<P>flourishing settlement of Sambir saw the lights shining about



<P>"Almayer's Folly."&nbsp; These were the lanterns of the boats hung up



<P>by the seamen under the verandah where the two officers were



<P>holding a court of inquiry into the truth of the story related to



<P>them by Babalatchi.&nbsp; Babalatchi had regained all his importance.



<P>He was eloquent and persuasive, calling Heaven and Earth to



<P>witness the truth of his statements.&nbsp; There were also other



<P>witnesses.&nbsp; Mahmat Banjer and a good many others underwent a



<P>close examination that dragged its weary length far into the



<P>evening.&nbsp; A messenger was sent for Abdulla, who excused himself



<P>from coming on the score of his venerable age, but sent Reshid.



<P>Mahmat had to produce the bangle, and saw with rage and



<P>mortification the lieutenant put it in his pocket, as one of the



<P>proofs of Dain's death, to be sent in with the official report of



<P>the mission.&nbsp; Babalatchi's ring was also impounded for the same



<P>purpose, but the experienced statesman was resigned to that loss



<P>from the very beginning.&nbsp; He did not mind as long as he was sure,



<P>that the white men believed.&nbsp; He put that question to himself



<P>earnestly as he left, one of the last, when the proceedings came



<P>to a close.&nbsp; He was not certain.&nbsp; Still, if they believed

only



<P>for a night, he would put Dain beyond their reach and feel safe



<P>himself.&nbsp; He walked away fast, looking from time to time over his



<P>shoulder in the fear of being followed, but he saw and heard



<P>nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ten o'clock," said the lieutenant, looking at his watch and



<P>yawning.&nbsp; "I shall hear some of the captain's complimentary



<P>remarks when we get back.&nbsp; Miserable business, this."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you think all this is true?" asked the younger man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"True! It is just possible.&nbsp; But if it isn't true what can we do?



<P>If we had a dozen boats we could patrol the creeks; and that



<P>wouldn't be much good.&nbsp; That drunken madman was right; we haven't



<P>enough hold on this coast.&nbsp; They do what they like.&nbsp; Are our



<P>hammocks slung?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I told the coxswain.&nbsp; Strange couple over there," said the



<P>sub, with a wave of his hand towards Almayer's house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hem! Queer, certainly.&nbsp; What have you been telling her?&nbsp;

I was



<P>attending to the father most of the time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I assure you I have been perfectly civil," protested the other



<P>warmly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All right.&nbsp; Don't get excited.&nbsp; She objects to civility,

then,



<P>from what I understand.&nbsp; I thought you might have been tender.



<P>You know we are on service."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, of course.&nbsp; Never forget that.&nbsp; Coldly civil.&nbsp;

That's



<P>all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They both laughed a little, and not feeling sleepy began to pace



<P>the verandah side by side.&nbsp; The moon rose stealthily above the



<P>trees, and suddenly changed the river into a stream of



<P>scintillating silver.&nbsp; The forest came out of the black void and



<P>stood sombre and pensive over the sparkling water.&nbsp; The breeze



<P>died away into a breathless calm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Seamanlike, the two officers tramped measuredly up and down



<P>without exchanging a word.&nbsp; The loose planks rattled rhythmically



<P>under their steps with obstrusive dry sound in the perfect



<P>silence of the night.&nbsp; As they were wheeling round again the



<P>younger man stood attentive.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did you hear that?" he asked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No!" said the other.&nbsp; "Hear what?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought I heard a cry.&nbsp; Ever so faint.&nbsp; Seemed a woman's



<P>voice.&nbsp; In that other house.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Again!&nbsp; Hear

it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," said the lieutenant, after listening awhile.&nbsp; "You young



<P>fellows always hear women's voices.&nbsp; If you are going to dream



<P>you had better get into your hammock.&nbsp; Good-night."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The moon mounted higher, and the warm shadows grew smaller and



<P>crept away as if hiding before the cold and cruel light.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The bright sunshine of the clear mistless morning, after the



<P>stormy night, flooded the main path of the settlement leading



<P>from the low shore of the Pantai branch of the river to the gate



<P>of Abdulla's compound.&nbsp; The path was deserted this morning; it



<P>stretched its dark yellow surface, hard beaten by the tramp of



<P>many bare feet, between the clusters of palm trees, whose tall



<P>trunks barred it with strong black lines at irregular intervals,



<P>while the newly risen sun threw the shadows of their leafy heads



<P>far away over the roofs of the buildings lining the river, even



<P>over the river itself as it flowed swiftly and silently past the



<P>deserted houses.&nbsp; For the houses were deserted too.&nbsp; On the



<P>narrow strip of trodden grass intervening between their open



<P>doors and the road, the morning fires smouldered untended,



<P>sending thin fluted columns of smoke into the cool air, and



<P>spreading the thinnest veil of mysterious blue haze over the



<P>sunlit solitude of the settlement.&nbsp; Almayer, just out of his



<P>hammock, gazed sleepily at the unwonted appearance of Sambir,



<P>wondering vaguely at the absence of life.&nbsp; His own house was very



<P>quiet; he could not hear his wife's voice, nor the sound of



<P>Nina's footsteps in the big room, opening on the verandah, which



<P>he called his sitting-room, whenever, in the company of white



<P>men, he wished to assert his claims to the commonplace decencies



<P>of civilisation.&nbsp; Nobody ever sat there; there was nothing there



<P>to sit upon, for Mrs. Almayer in her savage moods, when excited



<P>by the reminiscences of the piratical period of her life, had



<P>torn off the curtains to make sarongs for the slave-girls, and



<P>had burnt the showy furniture piecemeal to cook the family rice.



<P>But Almayer was not thinking of his furniture now.&nbsp; He was



<P>thinking of Dain's return, of Dain's nocturnal interview with



<P>Lakamba, of its possible influence on his long-matured plans, now



<P>nearing the period of their execution.&nbsp; He was also uneasy at the



<P>non-appearance of Dain who had promised him an early visit.&nbsp; "The



<P>fellow had plenty of time to cross the river," he mused, "and



<P>there was so much to be done to-day.&nbsp; The settling of details for



<P>the early start on the morrow; the launching of the boats; the



<P>thousand and one finishing touches.&nbsp; For the expedition must



<P>start complete, nothing should be forgotten, nothing should--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sense of the unwonted solitude grew upon him suddenly, and in



<P>the unusual silence he caught himself longing even for the



<P>usually unwelcome sound of his wife's voice to break the



<P>oppressive stillness which seemed, to his frightened fancy, to



<P>portend the advent of some new misfortune.&nbsp; "What has happened?"



<P>he muttered half aloud, as he shuffled in his imperfectly



<P>adjusted slippers towards the balustrade of the verandah.&nbsp; "Is



<P>everybody asleep or dead?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The settlement was alive and very much awake.&nbsp; It was awake ever



<P>since the early break of day, when Mahmat Banjer, in a fit of



<P>unheard-of energy, arose and, taking up his hatchet, stepped over



<P>the sleeping forms of his two wives and walked shivering to the



<P>water's edge to make sure that the new house he was building had



<P>not floated away during the night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The house was being built by the enterprising Mahmat on a large



<P>raft, and he had securely moored it just inside the muddy point



<P>of land at the junction of the two branches of the Pantai so as



<P>to be out of the way of drifting logs that would no doubt strand



<P>on the point during the freshet.&nbsp; Mahmat walked through the wet



<P>grass saying bourrouh, and cursing softly to himself the hard



<P>necessities of active life that drove him from his warm couch



<P>into the cold of the morning.&nbsp; A glance showed him that his house



<P>was still there, and he congratulated himself on his foresight in



<P>hauling it out of harm's way, for the increasing light showed him



<P>a confused wrack of drift-logs, half-stranded on the muddy flat,



<P>interlocked into a shapeless raft by their branches, tossing to



<P>and fro and grinding together in the eddy caused by the meeting



<P>currents of the two branches of the river.&nbsp; Mahmat walked down

to



<P>the water's edge to examine the rattan moorings of his house just



<P>as the sun cleared the trees of the forest on the opposite shore.



<P>As he bent over the fastenings he glanced again carelessly at the



<P>unquiet jumble of logs and saw there something that caused him to



<P>drop his hatchet and stand up, shading his eyes with his hand



<P>from the rays of the rising sun.&nbsp; It was something red, and the



<P>logs rolled over it, at times closing round it, sometimes hiding



<P>it.&nbsp; It looked to him at first like a strip of red cloth.&nbsp;

The



<P>next moment Mahmat had made it out and raised a great shout.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah ya! There!" yelled Mahmat.&nbsp; "There's a man amongst the logs."



<P>He put the palms of his hand to his lips and shouted, enunciating



<P>distinctly, his face turned towards the settlement: "There's a



<P>body of a man in the river! Come and see! A dead--stranger!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The women of the nearest house were already outside kindling the



<P>fires and husking the morning rice.&nbsp; They took up the cry



<P>shrilly, and it travelled so from house to house, dying away in



<P>the distance.&nbsp; The men rushed out excited but silent, and ran



<P>towards the muddy point where the unconscious logs tossed and



<P>ground and bumped and rolled over the dead stranger with the



<P>stupid persistency of inanimate things.&nbsp; The women followed,



<P>neglecting their domestic duties and disregarding the



<P>possibilities of domestic discontent, while groups of children



<P>brought up the rear, warbling joyously, in the delight of



<P>unexpected excitement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer called aloud for his wife and daughter, but receiving no



<P>response, stood listening intently.&nbsp; The murmur of the crowd



<P>reached him faintly, bringing with it the assurance of some



<P>unusual event.&nbsp; He glanced at the river just as he was going to



<P>leave the verandah and checked himself at the sight of a small



<P>canoe crossing over from the Rajah's landing-place.&nbsp; The solitary



<P>occupant (in whom Almayer soon recognised Babalatchi) effected



<P>the crossing a little below the house and paddled up to the



<P>Lingard jetty in the dead water under the bank.&nbsp; Babalatchi



<P>clambered out slowly and went on fastening his canoe with



<P>fastidious care, as if not in a hurry to meet Almayer, whom he



<P>saw looking at him from the verandah.&nbsp; This delay gave Almayer



<P>time to notice and greatly wonder at Babalatchi's official



<P>get-up.&nbsp; The statesman of Sambir was clad in a costume befitting



<P>his high rank.&nbsp; A loudly checkered sarong encircled his waist,



<P>and from its many folds peeped out the silver hilt of the kriss



<P>that saw the light only on great festivals or during official



<P>receptions.&nbsp; Over the left shoulder and across the otherwise



<P>unclad breast of the aged diplomatist glistened a patent leather



<P>belt bearing a brass plate with the arms of Netherlands under the



<P>inscription, "Sultan of Sambir."&nbsp; Babalatchi's head was covered



<P>by a red turban, whose fringed ends falling over the left cheek



<P>and shoulder gave to his aged face a ludicrous expression of



<P>joyous recklessness.&nbsp; When the canoe was at last fastened to his



<P>satisfaction he straightened himself up, shaking down the folds



<P>of his sarong, and moved with long strides towards Almayer's



<P>house, swinging regularly his long ebony staff, whose gold head



<P>ornamented with precious stones flashed in the morning sun.



<P>Almayer waved his hand to the right towards the point of land, to



<P>him invisible, but in full view from the jetty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Babalatchi! oh!" he called out; "what is the matter there?



<P>can you see?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi stopped and gazed intently at the crowd on the river



<P>bank, and after a little while the astonished Almayer saw him



<P>leave the path, gather up his sarong in one hand, and break into



<P>a trot through the grass towards the muddy point.&nbsp; Almayer, now



<P>greatly interested, ran down the steps of the verandah.&nbsp; The



<P>murmur of men's voices and the shrill cries of women reached him



<P>quite distinctly now, and as soon as he turned the corner of his



<P>house he could see the crowd on the low promontory swaying and



<P>pushing round some object of interest.&nbsp; He could indistinctly



<P>hear Babalatchi's voice, then the crowd opened before the aged



<P>statesman and closed after him with an excited hum, ending in a



<P>loud shout.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Almayer approached the throng a man ran out and rushed past



<P>him towards the settlement, unheeding his call to stop and



<P>explain the cause of this excitement.&nbsp; On the very outskirts of



<P>the crowd Almayer found himself arrested by an unyielding mass of



<P>humanity, regardless of his entreaties for a passage, insensible



<P>to his gentle pushes as he tried to work his way through it



<P>towards the riverside.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the midst of his gentle and slow progress he fancied suddenly



<P>he had heard his wife's voice in the thickest of the throng.&nbsp; He



<P>could not mistake very well Mrs. Almayer's high-pitched tones,



<P>yet the words were too indistinct for him to understand their



<P>purport.&nbsp; He paused in his endeavours to make a passage for



<P>himself, intending to get some intelligence from those around



<P>him, when a long and piercing shriek rent the air, silencing the



<P>murmurs of the crowd and the voices of his informants.&nbsp; For a



<P>moment Almayer remained as if turned into stone with astonishment



<P>and horror, for he was certain now that he had heard his wife



<P>wailing for the dead.&nbsp; He remembered Nina's unusual absence, and



<P>maddened by his apprehensions as to her safety, he pushed blindly



<P>and violently forward, the crowd falling back with cries of



<P>surprise and pain before his frantic advance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the point of land in a little clear space lay the body of the



<P>stranger just hauled out from amongst the logs.&nbsp; On one side



<P>stood Babalatchi, his chin resting on the head of his staff and



<P>his one eye gazing steadily at the shapeless mass of broken



<P>limbs, torn flesh, and bloodstained rags.&nbsp; As Almayer burst



<P>through the ring of horrified spectators, Mrs. Almayer threw her



<P>own head-veil over the upturned face of the drowned man, and,



<P>squatting by it, with another mournful howl, sent a shiver



<P>through the now silent crowd.&nbsp; Mahmat, dripping wet, turned to



<P>Almayer, eager to tell his tale.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the first moment of reaction from the anguish of his fear the



<P>sunshine seemed to waver before Almayer's eyes, and he listened



<P>to words spoken around him without comprehending their meaning.



<P>When, by a strong effort of will, he regained the possession of



<P>his senses, Mahmat was saying--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is the way, Tuan.&nbsp; His sarong was caught in the broken



<P>branch, and he hung with his head under water.&nbsp; When I saw what



<P>it was I did not want it here.&nbsp; I wanted it to get clear and



<P>drift away.&nbsp; Why should we bury a stranger in the midst of our



<P>houses for his ghost to frighten our women and children?&nbsp; Have

we



<P>not enough ghosts about this place?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A murmur of approval interrupted him here.&nbsp; Mahmat looked



<P>reproachfully at Babalatchi.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But the Tuan Babalatchi ordered me to drag the body ashore"--he



<P>went on looking round at his audience, but addressing himself



<P>only to Almayer--"and I dragged him by the feet; in through the



<P>mud I have dragged him, although my heart longed to see him float



<P>down the river to strand perchance on Bulangi's clearing--may his



<P>father's grave be defiled!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was subdued laughter at this, for the enmity of Mahmat and



<P>Bulangi was a matter of common notoriety and of undying interest



<P>to the inhabitants of Sambir.&nbsp; In the midst of that mirth Mrs.



<P>Almayer wailed suddenly again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Allah!&nbsp; What ails the woman!" exclaimed Mahmat, angrily.&nbsp;

"Here,



<P>I have touched this carcass which came from nobody knows where,



<P>and have most likely defiled myself before eating rice.&nbsp; By



<P>orders of Tuan Babalatchi I did this thing to please the white



<P>man.&nbsp; Are you pleased, O Tuan Almayer?&nbsp; And what will be my



<P>recompense?&nbsp; Tuan Babalatchi said a recompense there will be, and



<P>from you.&nbsp; Now consider.&nbsp; I have been defiled, and if not

defiled



<P>I may be under the spell.&nbsp; Look at his anklets!&nbsp; Who ever

heard



<P>of a corpse appearing during the night amongst the logs with gold



<P>anklets on its legs?&nbsp; There is witchcraft there.&nbsp; However,"

added



<P>Mahmat, after a reflective pause, "I will have the anklet if



<P>there is permission, for I have a charm against the ghosts and am



<P>not afraid.&nbsp; God is great!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A fresh outburst of noisy grief from Mrs. Almayer checked the



<P>flow of Mahmat's eloquence.&nbsp; Almayer, bewildered, looked in turn



<P>at his wife, at Mahmat, at Babalatchi, and at last arrested his



<P>fascinated gaze on the body lying on the mud with covered face in



<P>a grotesquely unnatural contortion of mangled and broken limbs,



<P>one twisted and lacerated arm, with white bones protruding in



<P>many places through the torn flesh, stretched out; the hand with



<P>outspread fingers nearly touching his foot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you know who this is?" he asked of Babalatchi, in a low



<P>voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi, staring straight before him, hardly moved his lips,



<P>while Mrs. Almayer's persistent lamentations drowned the whisper



<P>of his murmured reply intended only for Almayer's ear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was fate.&nbsp; Look at your feet, white man.&nbsp; I can see a

ring on



<P>those torn fingers which I know well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Saying this, Babalatchi stepped carelessly forward, putting his



<P>foot as if accidentally on the hand of the corpse and pressing it



<P>into the soft mud.&nbsp; He swung his staff menacingly towards the



<P>crowd, which fell back a little.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go away," he said sternly, "and send your women to their cooking



<P>fires, which they ought not to have left to run after a dead



<P>stranger.&nbsp; This is men's work here.&nbsp; I take him now in the

name



<P>of the Rajah.&nbsp; Let no man remain here but Tuan Almayer's slaves.



<P>Now go!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The crowd reluctantly began to disperse.&nbsp; The women went first,



<P>dragging away the children that hung back with all their weight



<P>on the maternal hand.&nbsp; The men strolled slowly after them in ever



<P>forming and changing groups that gradually dissolved as they



<P>neared the settlement and every man regained his own house with



<P>steps quickened by the hungry anticipation of the morning rice.



<P>Only on the slight elevation where the land sloped down towards



<P>the muddy point a few men, either friends or enemies of Mahmat,



<P>remained gazing curiously for some time longer at the small group



<P>standing around the body on the river bank.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not understand what you mean, Babalatchi," said Almayer.



<P>"What is the ring you are talking about?&nbsp; Whoever he is, you have



<P>trodden the poor fellow's hand right into the mud.&nbsp; Uncover his



<P>face," he went on, addressing Mrs. Almayer, who, squatting by the



<P>head of the corpse, rocked herself to and fro, shaking from time



<P>to time her dishevelled grey locks, and muttering mournfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hai!' exclaimed Mahmat, who had lingered close by.&nbsp; "Look, Tuan;



<P>the logs came together so," and here he pressed the palms of his



<P>hands together, "and his head must have been between them, and



<P>now there is no face for you to look at.&nbsp; There are his flesh and



<P>his bones, the nose, and the lips, and maybe his eyes, but nobody



<P>could tell the one from the other.&nbsp; It was written the day he was



<P>born that no man could look at him in death and be able to say,



<P>'This is my friend's face.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Silence, Mahmat; enough!" said Babalatchi, "and take thy eyes



<P>off his anklet, thou eater of pigs flesh.&nbsp; Tuan Almayer," he went



<P>on, lowering his voice, "have you seen Dain this morning?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer opened his eyes wide and looked alarmed.&nbsp; "No," he said



<P>quickly; "haven't you seen him?&nbsp; Is he not with the Rajah?&nbsp;

I am



<P>waiting; why does he not come?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi nodded his head sadly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He is come, Tuan.&nbsp; He left last night when the storm was great



<P>and the river spoke angrily.&nbsp; The night was very black, but he



<P>had within him a light that showed the way to your house as



<P>smooth as a narrow backwater, and the many logs no bigger than



<P>wisps of dried grass.&nbsp; Therefore he went; and now he lies here."



<P>And Babalatchi nodded his head towards the body.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How can you tell?" said Almayer, excitedly, pushing his wife



<P>aside.&nbsp; He snatched the cover off and looked at the formless mass



<P>of flesh, hair, and drying mud, where the face of the drowned man



<P>should have been.&nbsp; "Nobody can tell," he added, turning away with



<P>a shudder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi was on his knees wiping the mud from the stiffened



<P>fingers of the outstretched hand.&nbsp; He rose to his feet and



<P>flashed before Almayer's eyes a gold ring set with a large green



<P>stone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You know this well," he said.&nbsp; "This never left Dain's hand.&nbsp;

I



<P>had to tear the flesh now to get it off.&nbsp; Do you believe now?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer raised his hands to his head and let them fall listlessly



<P>by his side in the utter abandonment of despair.&nbsp; Babalatchi,



<P>looking at him curiously, was astonished to see him smile.&nbsp; A



<P>strange fancy had taken possession of Almayer's brain, distracted



<P>by this new misfortune.&nbsp; It seemed to him that for many years he



<P>had been falling into a deep precipice.&nbsp; Day after day, month



<P>after month, year after year, he had been falling, falling,



<P>falling; it was a smooth, round, black thing, and the black walls



<P>had been rushing upwards with wearisome rapidity.&nbsp; A great rush,



<P>the noise of which he fancied he could hear yet; and now, with an



<P>awful shock, he had reached the bottom, and behold! he was alive



<P>and whole, and Dain was dead with all his bones broken.&nbsp; It



<P>struck him as funny.&nbsp; A dead Malay; he had seen many dead Malays



<P>without any emotion; and now he felt inclined to weep, but it was



<P>over the fate of a white man he knew; a man that fell over a deep



<P>precipice and did not die.&nbsp; He seemed somehow to himself to be



<P>standing on one side, a little way off, looking at a certain



<P>Almayer who was in great trouble.&nbsp; Poor, poor fellow! Why doesn't



<P>he cut his throat? He wished to encourage him; he was very



<P>anxious to see him lying dead over that other corpse.&nbsp; Why does



<P>he not die and end this suffering? He groaned aloud unconsciously



<P>and started with affright at the sound of his own voice.&nbsp; Was he



<P>going mad? Terrified by the thought he turned away and ran



<P>towards his house repeating to himself, I am not going mad; of



<P>course not, no, no, no! He tried to keep a firm hold of the idea.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Not mad, not mad.&nbsp; He stumbled as he ran blindly up the steps



<P>repeating fast and ever faster those words wherein seemed to lie



<P>his salvation.&nbsp; He saw Nina standing there, and wished to say



<P>something to her, but could not remember what, in his extreme



<P>anxiety not to forget that he was not going mad, which he still



<P>kept repeating mentally as he ran round the table, till he



<P>stumbled against one of the arm-chairs and dropped into it



<P>exhausted.&nbsp; He sat staring wildly at Nina, still assuring himself



<P>mentally of his own sanity and wondering why the girl shrank from



<P>him in open-eyed alarm.&nbsp; What was the matter with her?&nbsp; This

was



<P>foolish.&nbsp; He struck the table violently with his clenched fist



<P>and shouted hoarsely, "Give me some gin!&nbsp; Run!"&nbsp; Then, while

Nina



<P>ran off, he remained in the chair, very still and quiet,



<P>astonished at the noise he had made.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina returned with a tumbler half filled with gin, and found her



<P>father staring absently before him.&nbsp; Almayer felt very tired now,



<P>as if he had come from a long journey.&nbsp; He felt as if he had



<P>walked miles and miles that morning and now wanted to rest very



<P>much.&nbsp; He took the tumbler with a shaking hand, and as he drank



<P>his teeth chattered against the glass which he drained and set



<P>down heavily on the table.&nbsp; He turned his eyes slowly towards



<P>Nina standing beside him, and said steadily--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now all is over, Nina.&nbsp; He is dead, and I may as well burn all



<P>my boats."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He felt very proud of being able to speak so calmly.&nbsp; Decidedly



<P>he was not going mad.&nbsp; This certitude was very comforting, and

he



<P>went on talking about the finding of the body, listening to his



<P>own voice complacently.&nbsp; Nina stood quietly, her hand resting



<P>lightly on her father's shoulder, her face unmoved, but every



<P>line of her features, the attitude of her whole body expressing



<P>the most keen and anxious attention.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And so Dain is dead," she said coldly, when her father ceased



<P>speaking.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer's elaborately calm demeanour gave way in a moment to an



<P>outburst of violent indignation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You stand there as if you were only half alive, and talk to me,"



<P>he exclaimed angrily, "as if it was a matter of no importance.



<P>Yes, he is dead!&nbsp; Do you understand?&nbsp; Dead!&nbsp; What do

you care?



<P>You never cared; you saw me struggle, and work, and strive,



<P>unmoved; and my suffering you could never see.&nbsp; No, never.&nbsp;

You



<P>have no heart, and you have no mind, or you would have understood



<P>that it was for you, for your happiness I was working.&nbsp; I wanted



<P>to be rich; I wanted to get away from here.&nbsp; I wanted to see



<P>white men bowing low before the power of your beauty and your



<P>wealth.&nbsp; Old as I am I wished to seek a strange land, a



<P>civilisation to which I am a stranger, so as to find a new life



<P>in the contemplation of your high fortunes, of your triumphs, of



<P>your happiness.&nbsp; For that I bore patiently the burden of work,

of



<P>disappointment, of humiliation amongst these savages here, and I



<P>had it all nearly in my grasp."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked at his daughter's attentive face and jumped to his feet



<P>upsetting the chair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you hear? I had it all there; so; within reach of my hand."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He paused, trying to keep down his rising anger, and failed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you no feeling?" he went on.&nbsp; "Have you lived without



<P>hope?"&nbsp; Nina's silence exasperated him; his voice rose, although



<P>he tried to master his feelings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you content to live in this misery and die in this wretched



<P>hole?&nbsp; Say something, Nina; have you no sympathy?&nbsp; Have you

no



<P>word of comfort for me?&nbsp; I that loved you so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He waited for a while for an answer, and receiving none shook his



<P>fist in his daughter's face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I believe you are an idiot!" he yelled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked round for the chair, picked it up and sat down stiffly.



<P>His anger was dead within him, and he felt ashamed of his



<P>outburst, yet relieved to think that now he had laid clear before



<P>his daughter the inner meaning of his life.&nbsp; He thought so in



<P>perfect good faith, deceived by the emotional estimate of his



<P>motives, unable to see the crookedness of his ways, the unreality



<P>of his aims, the futility of his regrets.&nbsp; And now his heart was



<P>filled only with a great tenderness and love for his daughter.



<P>He wanted to see her miserable, and to share with her his



<P>despair; but he wanted it only as all weak natures long for a



<P>companionship in misfortune with beings innocent of its cause.



<P>If she suffered herself she would understand and pity him; but



<P>now she would not, or could not, find one word of comfort or love



<P>for him in his dire extremity.&nbsp; The sense of his absolute



<P>loneliness came home to his heart with a force that made him



<P>shudder.&nbsp; He swayed and fell forward with his face on the table,



<P>his arms stretched straight out, extended and rigid.&nbsp; Nina made

a



<P>quick movement towards her father and stood looking at the grey



<P>head, on the broad shoulders shaken convulsively by the violence



<P>of feelings that found relief at last in sobs and tears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina sighed deeply and moved away from the table.&nbsp; Her features



<P>lost the appearance of stony indifference that had exasperated



<P>her father into his outburst of anger and sorrow.&nbsp; The expression



<P>of her face, now unseen by her father, underwent a rapid change.



<P>She had listened to Almayer's appeal for sympathy, for one word



<P>of comfort, apparently indifferent, yet with her breast torn by



<P>conflicting impulses raised unexpectedly by events she had not



<P>foreseen, or at least did not expect to happen so soon.&nbsp; With her



<P>heart deeply moved by the sight of Almayer's misery, knowing it



<P>in her power to end it with a word, longing to bring peace to



<P>that troubled heart, she heard with terror the voice of her



<P>overpowering love commanding her to be silent.&nbsp; And she submitted



<P>after a short and fierce struggle of her old self against the new



<P>principle of her life.&nbsp; She wrapped herself up in absolute



<P>silence, the only safeguard against some fatal admission.&nbsp; She



<P>could not trust herself to make a sign, to murmur a word for fear



<P>of saying too much; and the very violence of the feelings that



<P>stirred the innermost recesses of her soul seemed to turn her



<P>person into a stone.&nbsp; The dilated nostrils and the flashing eyes



<P>were the only signs of the storm raging within, and those signs



<P>of his daughter's emotion Almayer did not see, for his sight was



<P>dimmed by self-pity, by anger, and by despair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Had Almayer looked at his daughter as she leant over the front



<P>rail of the verandah he could have seen the expression of



<P>indifference give way to a look of pain, and that again pass



<P>away, leaving the glorious beauty of her face marred by



<P>deep-drawn lines of watchful anxiety.&nbsp; The long grass in the



<P>neglected courtyard stood very straight before her eyes in the



<P>noonday heat.&nbsp; From the river-bank there were voices and a



<P>shuffle of bare feet approaching the house; Babalatchi could be



<P>heard giving directions to Almayer's men, and Mrs. Almayer's



<P>subdued wailing became audible as the small procession bearing



<P>the body of the drowned man and headed by that sorrowful matron



<P>turned the corner of the house.&nbsp; Babalatchi had taken the broken



<P>anklet off the man's leg, and now held it in his hand as he moved



<P>by the side of the bearers, while Mahmat lingered behind timidly,



<P>in the hopes of the promised reward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Lay him there," said Babalatchi to Almayer's men, pointing to a



<P>pile of drying planks in front of the verandah.&nbsp; "Lay him there.



<P>He was a Kaffir and the son of a dog, and he was the white man's



<P>friend.&nbsp; He drank the white man's strong water," he added, with



<P>affected horror.&nbsp; "That I have seen myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The men stretched out the broken limbs on two planks they had



<P>laid level, while Mrs. Almayer covered the body with a piece of



<P>white cotton cloth, and after whispering for some time with



<P>Babalatchi departed to her domestic duties.&nbsp; Almayer's men, after



<P>laying down their burden, dispersed themselves in quest of shady



<P>spots wherein to idle the day away.&nbsp; Babalatchi was left alone

by



<P>the corpse that laid rigid under the white cloth in the bright



<P>sunshine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina came down the steps and joined Babalatchi, who put his hand



<P>to his forehead, and squatted down with great deference.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have a bangle there," said Nina, looking down on



<P>Babalatchi's upturned face and into his solitary eye.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have, Mem Putih," returned the polite statesman.&nbsp; Then turning



<P>towards Mahmat he beckoned him closer, calling out, "Come here!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mahmat approached with some hesitation.&nbsp; He avoided looking at



<P>Nina, but fixed his eyes on Babalatchi.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, listen," said Babalatchi, sharply.&nbsp; "The ring and the



<P>anklet you have seen, and you know they belonged to Dain the



<P>trader, and to no other.&nbsp; Dain returned last night in a canoe.



<P>He spoke with the Rajah, and in the middle of the night left to



<P>cross over to the white man's house.&nbsp; There was a great flood,



<P>and this morning you found him in the river."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By his feet I dragged him out," muttered Mahmat under his



<P>breath.&nbsp; "Tuan Babalatchi, there will be a recompense!" he



<P>exclaimed aloud.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi held up the gold bangle before Mahmat's eyes.&nbsp; "What

I



<P>have told you, Mahmat, is for all ears.&nbsp; What I give you now is



<P>for your eyes only.&nbsp; Take."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mahmat took the bangle eagerly and hid it in the folds of his



<P>waist-cloth.&nbsp; "Am I a fool to show this thing in a house with



<P>three women in it?" he growled.&nbsp; "But I shall tell them about



<P>Dain the trader, and there will be talk enough."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He turned and went away, increasing his pace as soon as he was



<P>outside Almayer's compound.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi looked after him till he disappeared behind the



<P>bushes.&nbsp; "Have I done well, Mem Putih?" he asked, humbly



<P>addressing Nina.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have," answered Nina.&nbsp; "The ring you may keep yourself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi touched his lips and forehead, and scrambled to his



<P>feet.&nbsp; He looked at Nina, as if expecting her to say something



<P>more, but Nina turned towards the house and went up the steps,



<P>motioning him away with her hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi picked up his staff and prepared to go.&nbsp; It was very



<P>warm, and he did not care for the long pull to the Rajah's house.



<P>Yet he must go and tell the Rajah--tell of the event; of the



<P>change in his plans; of all his suspicions.&nbsp; He walked to the



<P>jetty and began casting off the rattan painter of his canoe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The broad expanse of the lower reach, with its shimmering surface



<P>dotted by the black specks of the fishing canoes, lay before his



<P>eyes.&nbsp; The fishermen seemed to be racing.&nbsp; Babalatchi paused

in



<P>his work, and looked on with sudden interest.&nbsp; The man in the



<P>foremost canoe, now within hail of the first houses of Sambir,



<P>laid in his paddle and stood up shouting--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The boats! the boats! The man-of-war's boats are coming!&nbsp; They



<P>are here!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a moment the settlement was again alive with people rushing to



<P>the riverside.&nbsp; The men began to unfasten their boats, the women



<P>stood in groups looking towards the bend down the river.&nbsp; Above



<P>the trees lining the reach a slight puff of smoke appeared like a



<P>black stain on the brilliant blue of the cloudless sky.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi stood perplexed, the painter in his hand.&nbsp; He looked



<P>down the reach, then up towards Almayer's house, and back again



<P>at the river as if undecided what to do.&nbsp; At last he made the



<P>canoe fast again hastily, and ran towards the house and up the



<P>steps of the verandah.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tuan! Tuan!" he called, eagerly.&nbsp; "The boats are coming.&nbsp;

The



<P>man-of-war's boats.&nbsp; You had better get ready.&nbsp; The officers

will



<P>come here, I know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer lifted his head slowly from the table, and looked at him



<P>stupidly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mem Putih!" exclaimed Babalatchi to Nina, "look at him.&nbsp; He does



<P>not hear.&nbsp; You must take care," he added meaningly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina nodded to him with an uncertain smile, and was going to



<P>speak, when a sharp report from the gun mounted in the bow of the



<P>steam launch that was just then coming into view arrested the



<P>words on her parted lips.&nbsp; The smile died out, and was replaced



<P>by the old look of anxious attention.&nbsp; From the hills far away



<P>the echo came back like a long-drawn and mournful sigh, as if the



<P>land had sent it in answer to the voice of its masters.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Dain was not long in crossing the river after leaving Almayer.



<P>He landed at the water-gate of the stockade enclosing the group



<P>of houses which composed the residence of the Rajah of Sambir.



<P>Evidently somebody was expected there, for the gate was open, and



<P>men with torches were ready to precede the visitor up the



<P>inclined plane of planks leading to the largest house where



<P>Lakamba actually resided, and where all the business of state was



<P>invariably transacted.&nbsp; The other buildings within the enclosure



<P>served only to accommodate the numerous household and the wives



<P>of the ruler.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lakamba's own house was a strong structure of solid planks,



<P>raised on high piles, with a verandah of split bamboos



<P>surrounding it on all sides; the whole was covered in by an



<P>immensely high-pitched roof of palm-leaves, resting on beams



<P>blackened by the smoke of many torches.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The building stood parallel to the river, one of its long sides



<P>facing the water-gate of the stockade.&nbsp; There was a door in the



<P>short side looking up the river, and the inclined plank-way led



<P>straight from the gate to that door.&nbsp; By the uncertain light of



<P>smoky torches, Dain noticed the vague outlines of a group of



<P>armed men in the dark shadows to his right.&nbsp; From that group



<P>Babalatchi stepped forward to open the door, and Dain entered the



<P>audience chamber of the Rajah's residence.&nbsp; About one-third of



<P>the house was curtained off, by heavy stuff of European



<P>manufacture, for that purpose; close to the curtain there was a



<P>big arm-chair of some black wood, much carved, and before it a



<P>rough deal table.&nbsp; Otherwise the room was only furnished with



<P>mats in great profusion.&nbsp; To the left of the entrance stood a



<P>rude arm-rack, with three rifles with fixed bayonets in it.&nbsp; By



<P>the wall, in the shadow, the body-guard of Lakamba--all friends



<P>or relations--slept in a confused heap of brown arms, legs, and



<P>multi-coloured garments, from whence issued an occasional snore



<P>or a subdued groan of some uneasy sleeper.&nbsp; An European lamp with



<P>a green shade standing on the table made all this indistinctly



<P>visible to Dain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are welcome to your rest here," said Babalatchi, looking at



<P>Dain interrogatively.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I must speak to the Rajah at once," answered Dain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi made a gesture of assent, and, turning to the brass



<P>gong suspended under the arm-rack, struck two sharp blows.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The ear-splitting din woke up the guard.&nbsp; The snores ceased;



<P>outstretched legs were drawn in; the whole heap moved, and slowly



<P>resolved itself into individual forms, with much yawning and



<P>rubbing of sleepy eyes; behind the curtains there was a burst of



<P>feminine chatter; then the bass voice of Lakamba was heard.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is that the Arab trader?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, Tuan," answered Babalatchi; "Dain has returned at last.&nbsp; He



<P>is here for an important talk, bitcharra--if you mercifully



<P>consent."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Evidently Lakamba's mercy went so far--for in a short while he



<P>came out from behind the curtain--but it did not go to the length



<P>of inducing him to make an extensive toilet.&nbsp; A short red sarong



<P>tightened hastily round his hips was his only garment.&nbsp; The



<P>merciful ruler of Sambir looked sleepy and rather sulky.&nbsp; He sat



<P>in the arm-chair, his knees well apart, his elbows on the



<P>arm-rests, his chin on his breast, breathing heavily and waiting



<P>malevolently for Dain to open the important talk.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Dain did not seem anxious to begin.&nbsp; He directed his gaze



<P>towards Babalatchi, squatting comfortably at the feet of his



<P>master, and remained silent with a slightly bent head as if in



<P>attentive expectation of coming words of wisdom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi coughed discreetly, and, leaning forward, pushed over



<P>a few mats for Dain to sit upon, then lifting up his squeaky



<P>voice he assured him with eager volubility of everybody's delight



<P>at this long-looked-for return.&nbsp; His heart had hungered for the



<P>sight of Dain's face, and his ears were withering for the want of



<P>the refreshing sound of his voice.&nbsp; Everybody's hearts and ears



<P>were in the same sad predicament, according to Babalatchi, as he



<P>indicated with a sweeping gesture the other bank of the river



<P>where the settlement slumbered peacefully, unconscious of the



<P>great joy awaiting it on the morrow when Dain's presence amongst



<P>them would be disclosed.&nbsp; "For"--went on Babalatchi--"what is the



<P>joy of a poor man if not the open hand of a generous trader or of



<P>a great--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here he checked himself abruptly with a calculated embarrassment



<P>of manner, and his roving eye sought the floor, while an



<P>apologetic smile dwelt for a moment on his misshapen lips.&nbsp; Once



<P>or twice during this opening speech an amused expression flitted



<P>across Dain's face, soon to give way, however, to an appearance



<P>of grave concern.&nbsp; On Lakamba's brow a heavy frown had settled,



<P>and his lips moved angrily as he listened to his Prime Minister's



<P>oratory.&nbsp; In the silence that fell upon the room when Babalatchi



<P>ceased speaking arose a chorus of varied snores from the corner



<P>where the body-guard had resumed their interrupted slumbers, but



<P>the distant rumble of thunder filling then Nina's heart with



<P>apprehension for the safety of her lover passed unheeded by those



<P>three men intent each on their own purposes, for life or death.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a short silence, Babalatchi, discarding now the flowers of



<P>polite eloquence, spoke again, but in short and hurried sentences



<P>and in a low voice.&nbsp; They had been very uneasy.&nbsp; Why did Dain



<P>remain so long absent?&nbsp; The men dwelling on the lower reaches of



<P>the river heard the reports of big guns and saw a fire-ship of



<P>the Dutch amongst the islands of the estuary.&nbsp; So they were



<P>anxious.&nbsp; Rumours of a disaster had reached Abdulla a few days



<P>ago, and since then they had been waiting for Dain's return under



<P>the apprehension of some misfortune.&nbsp; For days they had closed



<P>their eyes in fear, and woke up alarmed, and walked abroad



<P>trembling, like men before an enemy.&nbsp; And all on account of Dain.



<P>Would he not allay their fears for his safety, not for



<P>themselves?&nbsp; They were quiet and faithful, and devoted to the



<P>great Rajah in Batavia--may his fate lead him ever to victory for



<P>the joy and profit of his servants!&nbsp; "And here," went on



<P>Babalatchi, "Lakamba my master was getting thin in his anxiety



<P>for the trader he had taken under his protection; and so was



<P>Abdulla, for what would wicked men not say if perchance - "

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Be silent, fool!" growled Lakamba, angrily.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi subsided into silence with a satisfied smile, while



<P>Dain, who had been watching him as if fascinated, turned with a



<P>sigh of relief towards the ruler of Sambir.&nbsp; Lakamba did not



<P>move, and, without raising his head, looked at Dain from under



<P>his eyebrows, breathing audibly, with pouted lips, in an air of



<P>general discontent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Speak! O Dain!" he said at last.&nbsp; "We have heard many rumours.



<P>Many nights in succession has my friend Reshid come here with bad



<P>tidings.&nbsp; News travels fast along the coast.&nbsp; But they may

be



<P>untrue; there are more lies in men's mouths in these days than



<P>when I was young, but I am not easier to deceive now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All my words are true," said Dain, carelessly.&nbsp; "If you want to



<P>know what befell my brig, then learn that it is in the hands of



<P>the Dutch.&nbsp; Believe me, Rajah," he went on, with sudden energy,



<P>"the Orang Blanda have good friends in Sambir, or else how did



<P>they know I was coming thence?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lakamba gave Dain a short and hostile glance.&nbsp; Babalatchi rose



<P>quietly, and, going to the arm-rack, struck the gong violently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Outside the door there was a shuffle of bare feet; inside, the



<P>guard woke up and sat staring in sleepy surprise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, you faithful friend of the white Rajah," went on Dain,



<P>scornfully, turning to Babalatchi, who had returned to his place,



<P>"I have escaped, and I am here to gladden your heart.&nbsp; When I saw



<P>the Dutch ship I ran the brig inside the reefs and put her



<P>ashore.&nbsp; They did not dare to follow with the ship, so they sent



<P>the boats.&nbsp; We took to ours and tried to get away, but the ship



<P>dropped fireballs at us, and killed many of my men.&nbsp; But I am



<P>left, O Babalatchi!&nbsp; The Dutch are coming here.&nbsp; They are

seeking



<P>for me.&nbsp; They are coming to ask their faithful friend Lakamba and



<P>his slave Babalatchi.&nbsp; Rejoice!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But neither of his hearers appeared to be in a joyful mood.



<P>Lakamba had put one leg over his knee, and went on gently



<P>scratching it with a meditative air, while Babalatchi, sitting



<P>cross-legged, seemed suddenly to become smaller and very limp,



<P>staring straight before him vacantly.&nbsp; The guard evinced some



<P>interest in the proceedings, stretching themselves full length on



<P>the mats to be nearer the speaker.&nbsp; One of them got up and now



<P>stood leaning against the arm-rack, playing absently with the



<P>fringes of his sword-hilt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dain waited till the crash of thunder had died away in distant



<P>mutterings before he spoke again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you dumb, O ruler of Sambir, or is the son of a great Rajah



<P>unworthy of your notice?&nbsp; I am come here to seek refuge and to



<P>warn you, and want to know what you intend doing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You came here because of the white man's daughter," retorted



<P>Lakamba, quickly.&nbsp; "Your refuge was with your father, the Rajah



<P>of Bali, the Son of Heaven, the 'Anak Agong' himself.&nbsp; What am

I



<P>to protect great princes?&nbsp; Only yesterday I planted rice in a



<P>burnt clearing; to-day you say I hold your life in my hand."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi glanced at his master.&nbsp; "No man can escape his fate,"



<P>he murmured piously.&nbsp; "When love enters a man's heart he is like



<P>a child--without any understanding.&nbsp; Be merciful, Lakamba," he



<P>added, twitching the corner of the Rajah's sarong warningly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lakamba snatched away the skirt of the sarong angrily.&nbsp; Under the



<P>dawning comprehension of intolerable embarrassments caused by



<P>Dain's return to Sambir he began to lose such composure as he had



<P>been, till then, able to maintain; and now he raised his voice



<P>loudly above the whistling of the wind and the patter of rain on



<P>the roof in the hard squall passing over the house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You came here first as a trader with sweet words and great



<P>promises, asking me to look the other way while you worked your



<P>will on the white man there.&nbsp; And I did.&nbsp; What do you want

now?



<P>When I was young I fought.&nbsp; Now I am old, and want peace.&nbsp;

It is



<P>easier for me to have you killed than to fight the Dutch.&nbsp; It is



<P>better for me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The squall had now passed, and, in the short stillness of the



<P>lull in the storm, Lakamba repeated softly, as if to himself,



<P>"Much easier.&nbsp; Much better."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dain did not seem greatly discomposed by the Rajah's threatening



<P>words.&nbsp; While Lakamba was speaking he had glanced once rapidly



<P>over his shoulder, just to make sure that there was nobody behind



<P>him, and, tranquillised in that respect, he had extracted a



<P>siri-box out of the folds of his waist-cloth, and was wrapping



<P>carefully the little bit of betel-nut and a small pinch of lime



<P>in the green leaf tendered him politely by the watchful



<P>Babalatchi.&nbsp; He accepted this as a peace- offering from the



<P>silent statesman--a kind of mute protest against his master's



<P>undiplomatic violence, and as an omen of a possible understanding



<P>to be arrived at yet.&nbsp; Otherwise Dain was not uneasy.&nbsp; Although



<P>recognising the justice of Lakamba's surmise that he had come



<P>back to Sambir only for the sake of the white man's daughter, yet



<P>he was not conscious of any childish lack of understanding, as



<P>suggested by Babalatchi.&nbsp; In fact, Dain knew very well that



<P>Lakamba was too deeply implicated in the gunpowder smuggling to



<P>care for an investigation the Dutch authorities into that matter.



<P>When sent off by his father, the independent Rajah of Bali, at



<P>the time when the hostilities between Dutch and Malays threatened



<P>to spread from Sumatra over the whole archipelago, Dain had found



<P>all the big traders deaf to his guarded proposals, and above the



<P>temptation of the great prices he was ready to give for



<P>gunpowder.&nbsp; He went to Sambir as a last and almost hopeless



<P>resort, having heard in Macassar of the white man there, and of



<P>the regular steamer trading from Singapore--allured also by the



<P>fact that there was no Dutch resident on the river, which would



<P>make things easier, no doubt.&nbsp; His hopes got nearly wrecked

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>against the stubborn loyalty of Lakamba arising from



<P>well-understood self-interest; but at last the young man's



<P>generosity, his persuasive enthusiasm, the prestige of his



<P>father's great name, overpowered the prudent hesitation of the



<P>ruler of Sambir.&nbsp; Lakamba would have nothing to do himself with



<P>any illegal traffic.&nbsp; He also objected to the Arabs being made



<P>use of in that matter; but he suggested Almayer, saying that he



<P>was a weak man easily persuaded, and that his friend, the English



<P>captain of the steamer, could be made very useful--very likely



<P>even would join in the business, smuggling the powder in the



<P>steamer without Abdulla's knowledge.&nbsp; There again Dain met in



<P>Almayer with unexpected resistance; Lakamba had to send



<P>Babalatchi over with the solemn promise that his eyes would be



<P>shut in friendship for the white man, Dain paying for the promise



<P>and the friendship in good silver guilders of the hated Orang



<P>Blanda.&nbsp; Almayer, at last consenting, said the powder would be



<P>obtained, but Dain must trust him with dollars to send to



<P>Singapore in payment for it.&nbsp; He would induce Ford to buy and



<P>smuggle it in the steamer on board the brig.&nbsp; He did not want any



<P>money for himself out of the transaction, but Dain must help him



<P>in his great enterprise after sending off the brig.&nbsp; Almayer had



<P>explained to Dain that he could not trust Lakamba alone in that



<P>matter; he would be afraid of losing his treasure and his life



<P>through the cupidity of the Rajah; yet the Rajah had to be told,



<P>and insisted on taking a share in that operation, or else his



<P>eyes would remain shut no longer.&nbsp; To this Almayer had to submit.



<P>Had Dain not seen Nina he would have probably refused to engage



<P>himself and his men in the projected expedition to Gunong



<P>Mas--the mountain of gold.&nbsp; As it was he intended to return with



<P>half of his men as soon as the brig was clear of the reefs, but



<P>the persistent chase given him by the Dutch frigate had forced



<P>him to run south and ultimately to wreck and destroy his vessel



<P>in order to preserve his liberty or perhaps even his life.&nbsp; Yes,



<P>he had come back to Sambir for Nina, although aware that the



<P>Dutch would look for him there, but he had also calculated his



<P>chances of safety in Lakamba's hands.&nbsp; For all his ferocious



<P>talk, the merciful ruler would not kill him, for he had long ago



<P>been impressed with the notion that Dain possessed the secret of



<P>the white man's treasure; neither would he give him up to the



<P>Dutch, for fear of some fatal disclosure of complicity in the



<P>treasonable trade.&nbsp; So Dain felt tolerably secure as he sat



<P>meditating quietly his answer to the Rajah's bloodthirsty speech.



<P>Yes, he would point out to him the aspect of his position should



<P>he--Dain--fall into the hands of the Dutch and should he speak



<P>the truth.&nbsp; He would have nothing more to lose then, and he would



<P>speak the truth.&nbsp; And if he did return to Sambir, disturbing



<P>thereby Lakamba's peace of mind, what then?&nbsp; He came to look



<P>after his property.&nbsp; Did he not pour a stream of silver into Mrs.



<P>Almayer's greedy lap?&nbsp; He had paid, for the girl, a price worthy



<P>of a great prince, although unworthy of that delightfully



<P>maddening creature for whom his untamed soul longed in an



<P>intensity of desire far more tormenting than the sharpest pain.



<P>He wanted his happiness.&nbsp; He had the right to be in Sambir.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He rose, and, approaching the table, leaned both his elbows on



<P>it; Lakamba responsively edged his seat a little closer, while



<P>Babalatchi scrambled to his feet and thrust his inquisitive head



<P>between his master's and Dain's.&nbsp; They interchanged their ideas



<P>rapidly, speaking in whispers into each other's faces, very close



<P>now, Dain suggesting, Lakamba contradicting, Babalatchi



<P>conciliating and anxious in his vivid apprehension of coming



<P>difficulties.&nbsp; He spoke most, whispering earnestly, turning his



<P>head slowly from side to side so as to bring his solitary eye to



<P>bear upon each of his interlocutors in turn.&nbsp; Why should there

be



<P>strife? said he.&nbsp; Let Tuan Dain, whom he loved only less than his



<P>master, go trustfully into hiding.&nbsp; There were many places for



<P>that.&nbsp; Bulangi's house away in the clearing was best.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Bulangi was a safe man.&nbsp; In the network of crooked channels no



<P>white man could find his way.&nbsp; White men were strong, but very



<P>foolish.&nbsp; It was undesirable to fight them, but deception was



<P>easy.&nbsp; They were like silly women--they did not know the use of



<P>reason, and he was a match for any of them--went on Babalatchi,



<P>with all the confidence of deficient experience.&nbsp; Probably the



<P>Dutch would seek Almayer.&nbsp; Maybe they would take away their



<P>countryman if they were suspicious of him.&nbsp; That would be good.



<P>After the Dutch went away Lakamba and Dain would get the treasure



<P>without any trouble, and there would be one person less to share



<P>it.&nbsp; Did he not speak wisdom?&nbsp; Will Tuan Dain go to Bulangi's



<P>house till the danger is over, go at once?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dain accepted this suggestion of going into hiding with a certain



<P>sense of conferring a favour upon Lakamba and the anxious



<P>statesman, but he met the proposal of going at once with a



<P>decided no, looking Babalatchi meaningly in the eye.&nbsp; The



<P>statesman sighed as a man accepting the inevitable would do, and



<P>pointed silently towards the other bank of the river.&nbsp; Dain bent



<P>his head slowly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I am going there," he said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Before the day comes?" asked Babalatchi.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am going there now," answered Dain, decisively.&nbsp; "The Orang



<P>Blanda will not be here before to-morrow night, perhaps, and I



<P>must tell Almayer of our arrangements."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, Tuan.&nbsp; No; say nothing," protested Babalatchi.&nbsp; "I will

go



<P>over myself at sunrise and let him know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will see," said Dain, preparing to go.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The thunderstorm was recommencing outside, the heavy clouds



<P>hanging low overhead now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a constant rumble of distant thunder punctuated by the



<P>nearer sharp crashes, and in the continuous play of blue



<P>lightning the woods and the river showed fitfully, with all the



<P>elusive distinctness of detail characteristic of such a scene.



<P>Outside the door of the Rajah's house Dain and Babalatchi stood



<P>on the shaking verandah as if dazed and stunned by the violence



<P>of the storm.&nbsp; They stood there amongst the cowering forms of the



<P>Rajah's slaves and retainers seeking shelter from the rain, and



<P>Dain called aloud to his boatmen, who responded with an unanimous



<P>"Ada! Tuan!" while they looked uneasily at the river.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is a great flood!" shouted Babalatchi into Dain's ear.



<P>"The river is very angry.&nbsp; Look! Look at the drifting logs! Can



<P>you go?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dain glanced doubtfully on the livid expanse of seething water



<P>bounded far away on the other side by the narrow black line of



<P>the forests.&nbsp; Suddenly, in a vivid white flash, the low point of



<P>land with the bending trees on it and Almayer's house, leaped



<P>into view, flickered and disappeared.&nbsp; Dain pushed Babalatchi



<P>aside and ran down to the water-gate followed by his shivering



<P>boatmen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi backed slowly in and closed the door, then turned



<P>round and looked silently upon Lakamba.&nbsp; The Rajah sat still,



<P>glaring stonily upon the table, and Babalatchi gazed curiously at



<P>the perplexed mood of the man he had served so many years through



<P>good and evil fortune.&nbsp; No doubt the one-eyed statesman felt



<P>within his savage and much sophisticated breast the unwonted



<P>feelings of sympathy with, and perhaps even pity for, the man he



<P>called his master.&nbsp; From the safe position of a confidential



<P>adviser, he could, in the dim vista of past years, see himself--a



<P>casual cut-throat--finding shelter under that man's roof in the



<P>modest rice-clearing of early beginnings.&nbsp; Then came a long



<P>period of unbroken success, of wise counsels, and deep plottings



<P>resolutely carried out by the fearless Lakamba, till the whole



<P>east coast from Poulo Laut to Tanjong Batu listened to



<P>Babalatchi's wisdom speaking through the mouth of the ruler of



<P>Sambir.&nbsp; In those long years how many dangers escaped, how many



<P>enemies bravely faced, how many white men successfully



<P>circumvented!&nbsp; And now he looked upon the result of so many years



<P>of patient toil:&nbsp; the fearless Lakamba cowed by the shadow of an



<P>impending trouble.&nbsp; The ruler was growing old, and Babalatchi,



<P>aware of an uneasy feeling at the pit of his stomach, put both



<P>his hands there with a suddenly vivid and sad perception of the



<P>fact that he himself was growing old too; that the time of



<P>reckless daring was past for both of them, and that they had to



<P>seek refuge in prudent cunning.&nbsp; They wanted peace; they were



<P>disposed to reform; they were ready even to retrench, so as to



<P>have the wherewithal to bribe the evil days away, if bribed away



<P>they could be.&nbsp; Babalatchi sighed for the second time that night



<P>as he squatted again at his master's feet and tendered him his



<P>betel-nut box in mute sympathy.&nbsp; And they sat there in close yet



<P>silent communion of betel-nut chewers, moving their jaws slowly,



<P>expectorating decorously into the wide-mouthed brass vessel they



<P>passed to one another, and listening to the awful din of the



<P>battling elements outside.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is a very great flood," remarked Babalatchi, sadly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Lakamba.&nbsp; "Did Dain go?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He went, Tuan.&nbsp; He ran down to the river like a man possessed

of



<P>the Sheitan himself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was another long pause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He may get drowned," suggested Lakamba at last, with some show



<P>of interest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The floating logs are many," answered Babalatchi, "but he is a



<P>good swimmer," he added languidly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He ought to live," said Lakamba; "he knows where the treasure



<P>is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi assented with an ill-humoured grunt.&nbsp; His want of



<P>success in penetrating the white man's secret as to the locality



<P>where the gold was to be found was a sore point with the



<P>statesman of Sambir, as the only conspicuous failure in an



<P>otherwise brilliant career.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A great peace had now succeeded the turmoil of the storm.&nbsp; Only



<P>the little belated clouds, which hurried past overhead to catch



<P>up the main body flashing silently in the distance, sent down



<P>short showers that pattered softly with a soothing hiss over the



<P>palm-leaf roof.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lakamba roused himself from his apathy with an appearance of



<P>having grasped the situation at last.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Babalatchi," he called briskly, giving him a slight kick.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ada Tuan! I am listening."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If the Orang Blanda come here, Babalatchi, and take Almayer to



<P>Batavia to punish him for smuggling gunpowder, what will he do,



<P>you think?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know, Tuan."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are a fool," commented Lakamba, exultingly.&nbsp; "He will tell



<P>them where the treasure is, so as to find mercy.&nbsp; He will."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi looked up at his master and nodded his head with by no



<P>means a joyful surprise.&nbsp; He had not thought of this; there was

a



<P>new complication.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Almayer must die," said Lakamba, decisively, "to make our secret



<P>safe.&nbsp; He must die quietly, Babalatchi.&nbsp; You must do it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi assented, and rose wearily to his feet.&nbsp; "To-morrow?"



<P>he asked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; before the Dutch come.&nbsp; He drinks much coffee," answered



<P>Lakamba, with seeming irrelevancy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi stretched himself yawning, but Lakamba, in the



<P>flattering consciousness of a knotty problem solved by his own



<P>unaided intellectual efforts, grew suddenly very wakeful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Babalatchi," he said to the exhausted statesman, "fetch the box



<P>of music the white captain gave me.&nbsp; I cannot sleep."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At this order a deep shade of melancholy settled upon



<P>Babalatchi's features.&nbsp; He went reluctantly behind the curtain



<P>and soon reappeared carrying in his arms a small hand-organ,



<P>which he put down on the table with an air of deep dejection.



<P>Lakamba settled himself comfortably in his arm-chair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Turn, Babalatchi, turn," he murmured, with closed eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi's hand grasped the handle with the energy of despair,



<P>and as he turned, the deep gloom on his countenance changed into



<P>an expression of hopeless resignation.&nbsp; Through the open shutter



<P>the notes of Verdi's music floated out on the great silence over



<P>the river and forest.&nbsp; Lakamba listened with closed eyes and a



<P>delighted smile; Babalatchi turned, at times dozing off and



<P>swaying over, then catching himself up in a great fright with a



<P>few quick turns of the handle.&nbsp; Nature slept in an exhausted



<P>repose after the fierce turmoil, while under the unsteady hand of



<P>the statesman of Sambir the Trovatore fitfully wept, wailed, and



<P>bade good-bye to his Leonore again and again in a mournful round



<P>of tearful and endless iteration.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>"That is the place," said Dain, indicating with the blade of his



<P>paddle a small islet about a mile ahead of the canoe--"that is



<P>the place where Babalatchi promised that a boat from the prau



<P>would come for me when the sun is overhead.&nbsp; We will wait for



<P>that boat there."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer, who was steering, nodded without speaking, and by a



<P>slight sweep of his paddle laid the head of the canoe in the



<P>required direction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were just leaving the southern outlet of the Pantai, which



<P>lay behind them in a straight and long vista of water shining



<P>between two walls of thick verdure that ran downwards and towards



<P>each other, till at last they joined and sank together in the



<P>far-away distance.&nbsp; The sun, rising above the calm waters of the



<P>Straits, marked its own path by a streak of light that glided



<P>upon the sea and darted up the wide reach of the river, a hurried



<P>messenger of light and life to the gloomy forests of the coast;



<P>and in this radiance of the sun's pathway floated the black canoe



<P>heading for the islet which lay bathed in sunshine, the yellow



<P>sands of its encircling beach shining like an inlaid golden disc



<P>on the polished steel of the unwrinkled sea.&nbsp; To the north and



<P>south of it rose other islets, joyous in their brilliant



<P>colouring of green and yellow, and on the main coast the sombre



<P>line of mangrove bushes ended to the southward in the reddish



<P>cliffs of Tanjong Mirrah, advancing into the sea, steep and



<P>shadowless under the clear, light of the early morning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The bottom of the canoe grated upon the sand as the little craft



<P>ran upon the beach.&nbsp; Ali leaped on shore and held on while Dain



<P>stepped out carrying Nina in his arms, exhausted by the events



<P>and the long travelling during the night.&nbsp; Almayer was the last



<P>to leave the boat, and together with Ali ran it higher up on the



<P>beach.&nbsp; Then Ali, tired out by the long paddling, laid down in



<P>the shade of the canoe, and incontinently fell asleep.&nbsp; Almayer



<P>sat sideways on the gunwale, and with his arms crossed on his



<P>breast, looked to the southward upon the sea.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After carefully laying Nina down in the shade of the bushes



<P>growing in the middle of the islet, Dain threw himself beside her



<P>and watched in silent concern the tears that ran down from under



<P>her closed eyelids, and lost themselves in that fine sand upon



<P>which they both were lying face to face.&nbsp; These tears and this



<P>sorrow were for him a profound and disquieting mystery.&nbsp; Now,



<P>when the danger was past, why should she grieve?&nbsp; He doubted her



<P>love no more than he would have doubted the fact of his own



<P>existence, but as he lay looking ardently in her face, watching



<P>her tears, her parted lips, her very breath, he was uneasily



<P>conscious of something in her he could not understand.&nbsp; Doubtless



<P>she had the wisdom of perfect beings.&nbsp; He sighed.&nbsp; He felt



<P>something invisible that stood between them, something that would



<P>let him approach her so far, but no farther.&nbsp; No desire, no



<P>longing, no effort of will or length of life could destroy this



<P>vague feeling of their difference.&nbsp; With awe but also with great



<P>pride he concluded that it was her own incomparable perfection.



<P>She was his, and yet she was like a woman from another world.



<P>His!&nbsp; His!&nbsp; He exulted in the glorious thought; nevertheless

her



<P>tears pained him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With a wisp of her own hair which he took in his hand with timid



<P>reverence he tried in an access of clumsy tenderness to dry the



<P>tears that trembled on her eyelashes.&nbsp; He had his reward in a



<P>fleeting smile that brightened her face for the short fraction of



<P>a second, but soon the tears fell faster than ever, and he could



<P>bear it no more.&nbsp; He rose and walked towards Almayer, who still



<P>sat absorbed in his contemplation of the sea.&nbsp; It was a very,



<P>very long time since he had seen the sea--that sea that leads



<P>everywhere, brings everything, and takes away so much.&nbsp; He had



<P>almost forgotten why he was there, and dreamily he could see all



<P>his past life on the smooth and boundless surface that glittered



<P>before his eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dain's hand laid on Almayer's shoulder recalled him with a start



<P>from some country very far away indeed.&nbsp; He turned round, but his



<P>eyes seemed to look rather at the place where Dain stood than at



<P>the man himself.&nbsp; Dain felt uneasy under the unconscious gaze.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What?" said Almayer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She is crying," murmured Dain, softly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She is crying!&nbsp; Why?" asked Almayer, indifferently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I came to ask you.&nbsp; My Ranee smiles when looking at the man she



<P>loves.&nbsp; It is the white woman that is crying now.&nbsp; You would



<P>know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer shrugged his shoulders and turned away again towards the



<P>sea.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go, Tuan Putih," urged Dain.&nbsp; "Go to her; her tears are more



<P>terrible to me than the anger of gods."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are they?&nbsp; You will see them more than once.&nbsp; She told me

she



<P>could not live without you," answered Almayer, speaking without



<P>the faintest spark of expression in his face, "so it behoves you



<P>to go to her quick, for fear you may find her dead."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He burst into a loud and unpleasant laugh which made Dain stare



<P>at him with some apprehension, but got off the gunwale of the



<P>boat and moved slowly towards Nina, glancing up at the sun as he



<P>walked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And you go when the sun is overhead?" he said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Tuan.&nbsp; Then we go," answered Dain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have not long to wait," muttered Almayer.&nbsp; "It is most



<P>important for me to see you go.&nbsp; Both of you.&nbsp; Most important,"



<P>he repeated, stopping short and looking at Dain fixedly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He went on again towards Nina, and Dain remained behind.&nbsp; Almayer



<P>approached his daughter and stood for a time looking down on her.



<P>She did not open her eyes, but hearing footsteps near her,



<P>murmured in a low sob, "Dain."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer hesitated for a minute and then sank on the sand by her



<P>side.&nbsp; She, not hearing a responsive word, not feeling a touch,



<P>opened her eyes--saw her father, and sat up suddenly with a



<P>movement of terror.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, father!" she murmured faintly, and in that word there was



<P>expressed regret and fear and dawning hope.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall never forgive you, Nina," said Almayer, in a



<P>dispassionate voice.&nbsp; "You have torn my heart from me while I



<P>dreamt of your happiness.&nbsp; You have deceived me.&nbsp; Your eyes

that



<P>for me were like truth itself lied to me in every glance--for how



<P>long?&nbsp; You know that best.&nbsp; When you were caressing my cheek

you



<P>were counting the minutes to the sunset that was the signal for



<P>your meeting with that man--there!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He ceased, and they both sat silent side by side, not looking at



<P>each other, but gazing at the vast expanse of the sea.&nbsp; Almayer's



<P>words had dried Nina's tears, and her look grew hard as she



<P>stared before her into the limitless sheet of blue that shone



<P>limpid, unwaving, and steady like heaven itself.&nbsp; He looked at

it



<P>also, but his features had lost all expression, and life in his



<P>eyes seemed to have gone out.&nbsp; The face was a blank, without a



<P>sign of emotion, feeling, reason, or even knowledge of itself.



<P>All passion, regret, grief, hope, or anger--all were gone, erased



<P>by the hand of fate, as if after this last stroke everything was



<P>over and there was no need for any record.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Those few who saw Almayer during the short period of his



<P>remaining days were always impressed by the sight of that face



<P>that seemed to know nothing of what went on within: like the



<P>blank wall of a prison enclosing sin, regrets, and pain, and



<P>wasted life, in the cold indifference of mortar and stones.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is there to forgive?" asked Nina, not addressing Almayer



<P>directly, but more as if arguing with herself.&nbsp; "Can I not live



<P>my own life as you have lived yours?&nbsp; The path you would have



<P>wished me to follow has been closed to me by no fault of mine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You never told me," muttered Almayer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You never asked me," she answered, "and I thought you were like



<P>the others and did not care.&nbsp; I bore the memory of my humiliation



<P>alone, and why should I tell you that it came to me because I am



<P>your daughter?&nbsp; I knew you could not avenge me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And yet I was thinking of that only," interrupted Almayer, "and



<P>I wanted to give you years of happiness for the short day of your



<P>suffering.&nbsp; I only knew of one way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! but it was not my way!" she replied.&nbsp; "Could you give me



<P>happiness without life?&nbsp; Life!" she repeated with sudden energy



<P>that sent the word ringing over the sea.&nbsp; "Life that means power



<P>and love," she added in a low voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That!" said Almayer, pointing his finger at Dain standing close



<P>by and looking at them in curious wonder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, that!" she replied, looking her father full in the face and



<P>noticing for the first time with a slight gasp of fear the



<P>unnatural rigidity of his features.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I would have rather strangled you with my own hands," said



<P>Almayer, in an expressionless voice which was such a contrast to



<P>the desperate bitterness of his feelings that it surprised even



<P>himself.&nbsp; He asked himself who spoke, and, after looking slowly



<P>round as if expecting to see somebody, turned again his eyes



<P>towards the sea.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You say that because you do not understand the meaning of my



<P>words," she said sadly.&nbsp; "Between you and my mother there never



<P>was any love.&nbsp; When I returned to Sambir I found the place which



<P>I thought would be a peaceful refuge for my heart, filled with



<P>weariness and hatred--and mutual contempt.&nbsp; I have listened to



<P>your voice and to her voice.&nbsp; Then I saw that you could not



<P>understand me; for was I not part of that woman?&nbsp; Of her who was



<P>the regret and shame of your life?&nbsp; I had to choose--I hesitated.



<P>Why were you so blind?&nbsp; Did you not see me struggling before your



<P>eyes?&nbsp; But, when he came, all doubt disappeared, and I saw only



<P>the light of the blue and cloudless heaven--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will tell you the rest," interrupted Almayer:&nbsp; "when that man



<P>came I also saw the blue and the sunshine of the sky.&nbsp; A



<P>thunderbolt has fallen from that sky, and suddenly all is still



<P>and dark around me for ever.&nbsp; I will never forgive you, Nina; and



<P>to-morrow I shall forget you!&nbsp; I shall never forgive you," he



<P>repeated with mechanical obstinacy while she sat, her head bowed



<P>down as if afraid to look at her father.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To him it seemed of the utmost importance that he should assure



<P>her of his intention of never forgiving.&nbsp; He was convinced that



<P>his faith in her had been the foundation of his hopes, the motive



<P>of his courage, of his determination to live and struggle, and to



<P>be victorious for her sake.&nbsp; And now his faith was gone,



<P>destroyed by her own hands; destroyed cruelly, treacherously, in



<P>the dark; in the very moment of success.&nbsp; In the utter wreck of



<P>his affections and of all his feelings, in the chaotic disorder



<P>of his thoughts, above the confused sensation of physical pain



<P>that wrapped him up in a sting as of a whiplash curling round him



<P>from his shoulders down to his feet, only one idea remained clear



<P>and definite--not to forgive her; only one vivid desire--to



<P>forget her.&nbsp; And this must be made clear to her--and to



<P>himself--by frequent repetition.&nbsp; That was his idea of his duty



<P>to himself--to his race--to his respectable connections; to the



<P>whole universe unsettled and shaken by this frightful catastrophe



<P>of his life.&nbsp; He saw it clearly and believed he was a strong man.



<P>He had always prided himself upon his unflinching firmness.&nbsp; And



<P>yet he was afraid.&nbsp; She had been all in all to him.&nbsp; What

if he



<P>should let the memory of his love for her weaken the sense of his



<P>dignity?&nbsp; She was a remarkable woman; he could see that; all the



<P>latent greatness of his nature--in which he honestly



<P>believed--had been transfused into that slight, girlish figure.



<P>Great things could be done!&nbsp; What if he should suddenly take her



<P>to his heart, forget his shame, and pain, and anger, and--follow



<P>her!&nbsp; What if he changed his heart if not his skin and made her



<P>life easier between the two loves that would guard her from any



<P>mischance!&nbsp; His heart yearned for her.&nbsp; What if he should

say



<P>that his love for her was greater than . . .

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will never forgive you, Nina!" he shouted, leaping up madly in



<P>the sudden fear of his dream.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was the last time in his life that he was heard to raise his



<P>voice.&nbsp; Henceforth he spoke always in a monotonous whisper like



<P>an instrument of which all the strings but one are broken in a



<P>last ringing clamour under a heavy blow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She rose to her feet and looked at him.&nbsp; The very violence of his



<P>cry soothed her in an intuitive conviction of his love, and she



<P>hugged to her breast the lamentable remnants of that affection



<P>with the unscrupulous greediness of women who cling desperately



<P>to the very scraps and rags of love, any kind of love, as a thing



<P>that of right belongs to them and is the very breath of their



<P>life.&nbsp; She put both her hands on Almayer's shoulders, and looking



<P>at him half tenderly, half playfully, she said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You speak so because you love me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer shook his head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, you do," she insisted softly; then after a short pause she



<P>added, "and you will never forget me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer shivered slightly.&nbsp; She could not have said a more cruel



<P>thing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here is the boat coming now," said Dain, his arm outstretched



<P>towards a black speck on the water between the coast and the



<P>islet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They all looked at it and remained standing in silence till the



<P>little canoe came gently on the beach and a man landed and walked



<P>towards them.&nbsp; He stopped some distance off and hesitated.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What news?" asked Dain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We have had orders secretly and in the night to take off from



<P>this islet a man and a woman.&nbsp; I see the woman.&nbsp; Which of

you is



<P>the man?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come, delight of my eyes," said Dain to Nina.&nbsp; "Now we go, and



<P>your voice shall be for my ears only.&nbsp; You have spoken your last



<P>words to the Tuan Putih, your father.&nbsp; Come."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She hesitated for a while, looking at Almayer, who kept his eyes



<P>steadily on the sea, then she touched his forehead in a lingering



<P>kiss, and a tear--one of her tears--fell on his cheek and ran



<P>down his immovable face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Goodbye," she whispered, and remained irresolute till he pushed



<P>her suddenly into Dain's arms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you have any pity for me," murmured Almayer, as if repeating



<P>some sentence learned by heart, "take that woman away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He stood very straight, his shoulders thrown back, his head held



<P>high, and looked at them as they went down the beach to the



<P>canoe, walking enlaced in each other's arms.&nbsp; He looked at the



<P>line of their footsteps marked in the sand.&nbsp; He followed their



<P>figures moving in the crude blaze of the vertical sun, in that



<P>light violent and vibrating, like a triumphal flourish of brazen



<P>trumpets.&nbsp; He looked at the man's brown shoulders, at the red



<P>sarong round his waist; at the tall, slender, dazzling white



<P>figure he supported.&nbsp; He looked at the white dress, at the



<P>falling masses of the long black hair.&nbsp; He looked at them



<P>embarking, and at the canoe growing smaller in the distance, with



<P>rage, despair, and regret in his heart, and on his face a peace



<P>as that of a carved image of oblivion.&nbsp; Inwardly he felt himself



<P>torn to pieces, but Ali--who now aroused--stood close to his



<P>master, saw on his features the blank expression of those who



<P>live in that hopeless calm which sightless eyes only can give.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The canoe disappeared, and Almayer stood motionless with his eyes



<P>fixed on its wake.&nbsp; Ali from under the shade of his hand examined



<P>the coast curiously.&nbsp; As the sun declined, the sea-breeze sprang



<P>up from the northward and shivered with its breath the glassy



<P>surface of the water.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dapat!" exclaimed Ali, joyously.&nbsp; "Got him, master!&nbsp; Got

prau!



<P>Not there!&nbsp; Look more Tanah Mirrah side.&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp; That

way!



<P>Master, see?&nbsp; Now plain.&nbsp; See?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer followed Ali's forefinger with his eyes for a long time



<P>in vain.&nbsp; At last he sighted a triangular patch of yellow light



<P>on the red background of the cliffs of Tanjong Mirrah.&nbsp; It was



<P>the sail of the prau that had caught the sunlight and stood out,



<P>distinct with its gay tint, on the dark red of the cape.&nbsp; The



<P>yellow triangle crept slowly from cliff to cliff, till it cleared



<P>the last point of land and shone brilliantly for a fleeting



<P>minute on the blue of the open sea.&nbsp; Then the prau bore up to the



<P>southward: the light went out of the sail, and all at once the



<P>vessel itself disappeared, vanishing in the shadow of the steep



<P>headland that looked on, patient and lonely, watching over the



<P>empty sea.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer never moved.&nbsp; Round the little islet the air was full of



<P>the talk of the rippling water.&nbsp; The crested wavelets ran up the



<P>beach audaciously, joyously, with the lightness of young life,



<P>and died quickly, unresistingly, and graciously, in the wide



<P>curves of transparent foam on the yellow sand.&nbsp; Above, the white



<P>clouds sailed rapidly southwards as if intent upon overtaking



<P>something.&nbsp; Ali seemed anxious.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Master," he said timidly, "time to get house now.&nbsp; Long way off



<P>to pull.&nbsp; All ready, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Wait," whispered Almayer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now she was gone his business was to forget, and he had a strange



<P>notion that it should be done systematically and in order.&nbsp; To



<P>Ali's great dismay he fell on his hands and knees, and, creeping



<P>along the sand, erased carefully with his hand all traces of



<P>Nina's footsteps.&nbsp; He piled up small heaps of sand, leaving



<P>behind him a line of miniature graves right down to the water.



<P>After burying the last slight imprint of Nina's slipper he stood



<P>up, and, turning his face towards the headland where he had last



<P>seen the prau, he made an effort to shout out loud again his firm



<P>resolve to never forgive.&nbsp; Ali watching him uneasily saw only his



<P>lips move, but heard no sound.&nbsp; He brought his foot down with a



<P>stamp.&nbsp; He was a firm man--firm as a rock.&nbsp; Let her go.&nbsp;

He never



<P>had a daughter.&nbsp; He would forget.&nbsp; He was forgetting already.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ali approached him again, insisting on immediate departure, and



<P>this time he consented, and they went together towards their



<P>canoe, Almayer leading.&nbsp; For all his firmness he looked very



<P>dejected and feeble as he dragged his feet slowly through the



<P>sand on the beach; and by his side--invisible to Ali--stalked



<P>that particular fiend whose mission it is to jog the memories of



<P>men, lest they should forget the meaning of life.&nbsp; He whispered



<P>into Almayer's ear a childish prattle of many years ago.



<P>Almayer, his head bent on one side, seemed to listen to his



<P>invisible companion, but his face was like the face of a man that



<P>has died struck from behind--a face from which all feelings and



<P>all expression are suddenly wiped off by the hand of unexpected



<P>death.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They slept on the river that night, mooring their canoe under the



<P>bushes and lying down in the bottom side by side, in the absolute



<P>exhaustion that kills hunger, thirst, all feeling and all thought



<P>in the overpowering desire for that deep sleep which is like the



<P>temporary annihilation of the tired body.&nbsp; Next day they started



<P>again and fought doggedly with the current all the morning, till



<P>about midday they reached the settlement and made fast their



<P>little craft to the jetty of Lingard and Co.&nbsp; Almayer walked



<P>straight to the house, and Ali followed, paddles on shoulder,



<P>thinking that he would like to eat something.&nbsp; As they crossed



<P>the front courtyard they noticed the abandoned look of the place.



<P>Ali looked in at the different servants' houses: all were empty.



<P>In the back courtyard there was the same absence of sound and



<P>life.&nbsp; In the cooking-shed the fire was out and the black embers



<P>were cold.&nbsp; A tall, lean man came stealthily out of the banana



<P>plantation, and went away rapidly across the open space looking



<P>at them with big, frightened eyes over his shoulder.&nbsp; Some



<P>vagabond without a master; there were many such in the



<P>settlement, and they looked upon Almayer as their patron.&nbsp; They



<P>prowled about his premises and picked their living there, sure



<P>that nothing worse could befall them than a shower of curses when



<P>they got in the way of the white man, whom they trusted and



<P>liked, and called a fool amongst themselves.&nbsp; In the house, which



<P>Almayer entered through the back verandah, the only living thing



<P>that met his eyes was his small monkey which, hungry and



<P>unnoticed for the last two days, began to cry and complain in



<P>monkey language as soon as it caught sight of the familiar face.



<P>Almayer soothed it with a few words and ordered Ali to bring in



<P>some bananas, then while Ali was gone to get them he stood in the



<P>doorway of the front verandah looking at the chaos of overturned



<P>furniture.&nbsp; Finally he picked up the table and sat on it while



<P>the monkey let itself down from the roof-stick by its chain and



<P>perched on his shoulder.&nbsp; When the bananas came they had their



<P>breakfast together; both hungry, both eating greedily and



<P>showering the skins round them recklessly, in the trusting



<P>silence of perfect friendship.&nbsp; Ali went away, grumbling, to cook



<P>some rice himself, for all the women about the house had



<P>disappeared; he did not know where.&nbsp; Almayer did not seem to



<P>care, and, after he finished eating, he sat on the table swinging



<P>his legs and staring at the river as if lost in thought.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After some time he got up and went to the door of a room on the



<P>right of the verandah.&nbsp; That was the office.&nbsp; The office of



<P>Lingard and Co.&nbsp; He very seldom went in there.&nbsp; There was

no



<P>business now, and he did not want an office.&nbsp; The door was



<P>locked, and he stood biting his lower lip, trying to think of the



<P>place where the key could be.&nbsp; Suddenly he remembered:&nbsp; in

the



<P>women's room hung upon a nail.&nbsp; He went over to the doorway where



<P>the red curtain hung down in motionless folds, and hesitated for



<P>a moment before pushing it aside with his shoulder as if breaking



<P>down some solid obstacle.&nbsp; A great square of sunshine entering



<P>through the window lay on the floor.&nbsp; On the left he saw Mrs.



<P>Almayer's big wooden chest, the lid thrown back, empty; near it



<P>the brass nails of Nina's European trunk shone in the large



<P>initials N. A. on the cover.&nbsp; A few of Nina's dresses hung on



<P>wooden pegs, stiffened in a look of offended dignity at their



<P>abandonment.&nbsp; He remembered making the pegs himself and noticed



<P>that they were very good pegs.&nbsp; Where was the key?&nbsp; He looked



<P>round and saw it near the door where he stood.&nbsp; It was red with



<P>rust.&nbsp; He felt very much annoyed at that, and directly afterwards



<P>wondered at his own feeling.&nbsp; What did it matter?&nbsp; There soon



<P>would be no key--no door--nothing!&nbsp; He paused, key in hand, and



<P>asked himself whether he knew well what he was about.&nbsp; He went



<P>out again on the verandah and stood by the table thinking.&nbsp; The



<P>monkey jumped down, and, snatching a banana skin, absorbed itself



<P>in picking it to shreds industriously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Forget!" muttered Almayer, and that word started before him a



<P>sequence of events, a detailed programme of things to do.&nbsp; He



<P>knew perfectly well what was to be done now.&nbsp; First this, then



<P>that, and then forgetfulness would come easy.&nbsp; Very easy.&nbsp;

He had



<P>a fixed idea that if he should not forget before he died he would



<P>have to remember to all eternity.&nbsp; Certain things had to be taken



<P>out of his life, stamped out of sight, destroyed, forgotten.&nbsp; For



<P>a long time he stood in deep thought, lost in the alarming



<P>possibilities of unconquerable memory, with the fear of death and



<P>eternity before him.&nbsp; "Eternity!" he said aloud, and the sound

of



<P>that word recalled him out of his reverie.&nbsp; The monkey started,



<P>dropped the skin, and grinned up at him amicably.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He went towards the office door and with some difficulty managed



<P>to open it.&nbsp; He entered in a cloud of dust that rose under his



<P>feet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Books open with torn pages bestrewed the floor; other books lay



<P>about grimy and black, looking as if they had never been opened.



<P>Account books.&nbsp; In those books he had intended to keep day by day



<P>a record of his rising fortunes.&nbsp; Long time ago.&nbsp; A very long



<P>time.&nbsp; For many years there has been no record to keep on the



<P>blue and red ruled pages!&nbsp; In the middle of the room the big



<P>office desk, with one of its legs broken, careened over like the



<P>hull of a stranded ship; most of the drawers had fallen out,



<P>disclosing heaps of paper yellow with age and dirt.&nbsp; The



<P>revolving office chair stood in its place, but he found the pivot



<P>set fast when he tried to turn it.&nbsp; No matter.&nbsp; He desisted,

and



<P>his eyes wandered slowly from object to object.&nbsp; All those things



<P>had cost a lot of money at the time.&nbsp; The desk, the paper, the



<P>torn books, and the broken shelves, all under a thick coat of



<P>dust.&nbsp; The very dust and bones of a dead and gone business.&nbsp;

He



<P>looked at all these things, all that was left after so many years



<P>of work, of strife, of weariness, of discouragement, conquered so



<P>many times.&nbsp; And all for what?&nbsp; He stood thinking mournfully

of



<P>his past life till he heard distinctly the clear voice of a child



<P>speaking amongst all this wreck, ruin, and waste.&nbsp; He started



<P>with a great fear in his heart, and feverishly began to rake in



<P>the papers scattered on the floor, broke the chair into bits,



<P>splintered the drawers by banging them against the desk, and made



<P>a big heap of all that rubbish in one corner of the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He came out quickly, slammed the door after him, turned the key,



<P>and, taking it out, ran to the front rail of the verandah, and,



<P>with a great swing of his arm, sent the key whizzing into the



<P>river.&nbsp; This done he went back slowly to the table, called the



<P>monkey down, unhooked its chain, and induced it to remain quiet



<P>in the breast of his jacket.&nbsp; Then he sat again on the table and



<P>looked fixedly at the door of the room he had just left.&nbsp; He



<P>listened also intently.&nbsp; He heard a dry sound of rustling; sharp



<P>cracks as of dry wood snapping; a whirr like of a bird's wings



<P>when it rises suddenly, and then he saw a thin stream of smoke



<P>come through the keyhole.&nbsp; The monkey struggled under his coat.



<P>Ali appeared with his eyes starting out of his head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Master! House burn!" he shouted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer stood up holding by the table.&nbsp; He could hear the yells



<P>of alarm and surprise in the settlement.&nbsp; Ali wrung his hands,



<P>lamenting aloud.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Stop this noise, fool!" said Almayer, quietly.&nbsp; "Pick up my



<P>hammock and blankets and take them to the other house.&nbsp; Quick,



<P>now!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The smoke burst through the crevices of the door, and Ali, with



<P>the hammock in his arms, cleared in one bound the steps of the



<P>verandah.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It has caught well," muttered Almayer to himself.&nbsp; "Be quiet,



<P>Jack," he added, as the monkey made a frantic effort to escape



<P>from its confinement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The door split from top to bottom, and a rush of flame and smoke



<P>drove Almayer away from the table to the front rail of the



<P>verandah.&nbsp; He held on there till a great roar overhead assured



<P>him that the roof was ablaze.&nbsp; Then he ran down the steps of the



<P>verandah, coughing, half choked with the smoke that pursued him



<P>in bluish wreaths curling about his head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the other side of the ditch, separating Almayer's courtyard



<P>from the settlement, a crowd of the inhabitants of Sambir looked



<P>at the burning house of the white man.&nbsp; In the calm air the



<P>flames rushed up on high, coloured pale brick-red, with violet



<P>gleams in the strong sunshine.&nbsp; The thin column of smoke ascended



<P>straight and unwavering till it lost itself in the clear blue of



<P>the sky, and, in the great empty space between the two houses the



<P>interested spectators could see the tall figure of the Tuan



<P>Putih, with bowed head and dragging feet, walking slowly away



<P>from the fire towards the shelter of "Almayer's Folly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In that manner did Almayer move into his new house.&nbsp; He took



<P>possession of the new ruin, and in the undying folly of his heart



<P>set himself to wait in anxiety and pain for that forgetfulness



<P>which was so slow to come.&nbsp; He had done all he could.&nbsp; Every



<P>vestige of Nina's existence had been destroyed; and now with



<P>every sunrise he asked himself whether the longed-for oblivion



<P>would come before sunset, whether it would come before he died?



<P>He wanted to live only long enough to be able to forget, and the



<P>tenacity of his memory filled him with dread and horror of death;



<P>for should it come before he could accomplish the purpose of his



<P>life he would have to remember for ever!&nbsp; He also longed for



<P>loneliness.&nbsp; He wanted to be alone.&nbsp; But he was not.&nbsp;

In the dim



<P>light of the rooms with their closed shutters, in the bright



<P>sunshine of the verandah, wherever he went, whichever way he



<P>turned, he saw the small figure of a little maiden with pretty



<P>olive face, with long black hair, her little pink robe slipping



<P>off her shoulders, her big eyes looking up at him in the tender



<P>trustfulness of a petted child.&nbsp; Ali did not see anything, but

he



<P>also was aware of the presence of a child in the house.&nbsp; In his



<P>long talks by the evening fires of the settlement he used to tell



<P>his intimate friends of Almayer's strange doings.&nbsp; His master had



<P>turned sorcerer in his old age.&nbsp; Ali said that often when Tuan



<P>Putih had retired for the night he could hear him talking to



<P>something in his room.&nbsp; Ali thought that it was a spirit in the



<P>shape of a child.&nbsp; He knew his master spoke to a child from



<P>certain expressions and words his master used.&nbsp; His master spoke



<P>in Malay a little, but mostly in English, which he, Ali, could



<P>understand.&nbsp; Master spoke to the child at times tenderly, then

he



<P>would weep over it, laugh at it, scold it, beg of it to go away;



<P>curse it.&nbsp; It was a bad and stubborn spirit.&nbsp; Ali thought

his



<P>master had imprudently called it up, and now could not get rid of



<P>it.&nbsp; His master was very brave; he was not afraid to curse this



<P>spirit in the very Presence; and once he fought with it.&nbsp; Ali had



<P>heard a great noise as of running about inside the room and



<P>groans.&nbsp; His master groaned.&nbsp; Spirits do not groan.&nbsp;

His master



<P>was brave, but foolish.&nbsp; You cannot hurt a spirit.&nbsp; Ali expected



<P>to find his master dead next morning, but he came out very early,



<P>looking much older than the day before, and had no food all day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So far Ali to the settlement.&nbsp; To Captain Ford he was much more



<P>communicative, for the good reason that Captain Ford had the



<P>purse and gave orders.&nbsp; On each of Ford's monthly visits to



<P>Sambir Ali had to go on board with a report about the inhabitant



<P>of "Almayer's Folly."&nbsp; On his first visit to Sambir, after Nina's



<P>departure, Ford had taken charge of Almayer's affairs.&nbsp; They were



<P>not cumbersome.&nbsp; The shed for the storage of goods was empty, the



<P>boats had disappeared, appropriated--generally in night-time--by



<P>various citizens of Sambir in need of means of transport.&nbsp; During



<P>a great flood the jetty of Lingard and Co. left the bank and



<P>floated down the river, probably in search of more cheerful



<P>surroundings; even the flock of geese--"the only geese on the



<P>east coast"--departed somewhere, preferring the unknown dangers



<P>of the bush to the desolation of their old home.&nbsp; As time went

on



<P>the grass grew over the black patch of ground where the old house



<P>used to stand, and nothing remained to mark the place of the



<P>dwelling that had sheltered Almayer's young hopes, his foolish



<P>dream of splendid future, his awakening, and his despair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ford did not often visit Almayer, for visiting Almayer was not a



<P>pleasant task.&nbsp; At first he used to respond listlessly to the old



<P>seaman's boisterous inquiries about his health; he even made



<P>efforts to talk, asking for news in a voice that made it



<P>perfectly clear that no news from this world had any interest for



<P>him.&nbsp; Then gradually he became more silent--not sulkily--but as



<P>if he was forgetting how to speak.&nbsp; He used also to hide in the



<P>darkest rooms of the house, where Ford had to seek him out guided



<P>by the patter of the monkey galloping before him.&nbsp; The monkey was



<P>always there to receive and introduce Ford.&nbsp; The little animal



<P>seemed to have taken complete charge of its master, and whenever



<P>it wished for his presence on the verandah it would tug



<P>perseveringly at his jacket, till Almayer obediently came out



<P>into the sunshine, which he seemed to dislike so much.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One morning Ford found him sitting on the floor of the verandah,



<P>his back against the wall, his legs stretched stiffly out, his



<P>arms hanging by his side.&nbsp; His expressionless face, his eyes open



<P>wide with immobile pupils, and the rigidity of his pose, made him



<P>look like an immense man-doll broken and flung there out of the



<P>way.&nbsp; As Ford came up the steps he turned his head slowly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ford," he murmured from the floor, "I cannot forget."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Can't you?" said Ford, innocently, with an attempt at joviality:



<P>"I wish I was like you.&nbsp; I am losing my memory--age, I suppose;



<P>only the other day my mate--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He stopped, for Almayer had got up, stumbled, and steadied



<P>himself on his friend's arm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hallo! You are better to-day.&nbsp; Soon be all right," said Ford,



<P>cheerfully, but feeling rather scared.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer let go his arm and stood very straight with his head up



<P>and shoulders thrown back, looking stonily at the multitude of



<P>suns shining in ripples of the river.&nbsp; His jacket and his loose



<P>trousers flapped in the breeze on his thin limbs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let her go!" he whispered in a grating voice.&nbsp; "Let her go.&nbsp;

To-



<P>morrow I shall forget.&nbsp; I am a firm man, . . . firm as a . . .



<P>rock, .&nbsp; . . firm . . ."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ford looked at his face--and fled.&nbsp; The skipper was a tolerably



<P>firm man himself--as those who had sailed with him could testify-



<P>-but Almayer's firmness was altogether too much for his



<P>fortitude.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Next time the steamer called in Sambir Ali came on board early



<P>with a grievance.&nbsp; He complained to Ford that Jim-Eng the



<P>Chinaman had invaded Almayer's house, and actually had lived



<P>there for the last month.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And they both smoke," added Ali.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Phew! Opium, you mean?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ali nodded, and Ford remained thoughtful; then he muttered to



<P>himself, "Poor devil! The sooner the better now."&nbsp; In the



<P>afternoon he walked up to the house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What are you doing here?" he asked of Jim-Eng, whom he found



<P>strolling about on the verandah.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jim-Eng explained in bad Malay, and speaking in that monotonous,



<P>uninterested voice of an opium smoker pretty far gone, that his



<P>house was old, the roof leaked, and the floor was rotten.&nbsp; So,



<P>being an old friend for many, many years, he took his money, his



<P>opium, and two pipes, and came to live in this big house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is plenty of room.&nbsp; He smokes, and I live here.&nbsp; He

will



<P>not smoke long," he concluded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where is he now?" asked Ford.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Inside.&nbsp; He sleeps," answered Jim-Eng, wearily.&nbsp; Ford glanced

in



<P>through the doorway.&nbsp; In the dim light of the room he could see



<P>Almayer lying on his back on the floor, his head on a wooden



<P>pillow, the long white beard scattered over his breast, the



<P>yellow skin of the face, the half-closed eyelids showing the



<P>whites of the eye only. . .&nbsp; .

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He shuddered and turned away.&nbsp; As he was leaving he noticed a



<P>long strip of faded red silk, with some Chinese letters on it,



<P>which Jim-Eng had just fastened to one of the pillars.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What's that?" he asked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That," said Jim-Eng, in his colourless voice, "that is the name



<P>of the house.&nbsp; All the same like my house.&nbsp; Very good name."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ford looked at him for awhile and went away.&nbsp; He did not know



<P>what the crazy-looking maze of the Chinese inscription on the red



<P>silk meant.&nbsp; Had he asked Jim-Eng, that patient Chinaman would



<P>have informed him with proper pride that its meaning was: "House



<P>of heavenly delight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the evening of the same day Babalatchi called on Captain Ford.



<P>The captain's cabin opened on deck, and Babalatchi sat astride on



<P>the high step, while Ford smoked his pipe on the settee inside.



<P>The steamer was leaving next morning, and the old statesman came



<P>as usual for a last chat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We had news from Bali last moon," remarked Babalatchi.&nbsp; "A



<P>grandson is born to the old Rajah, and there is great rejoicing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ford sat up interested.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," went on Babalatchi, in answer to Ford's look.&nbsp; "I told



<P>him.&nbsp; That was before he began to smoke."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, and what?" asked Ford.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I escaped with my life," said Babalatchi, with perfect gravity,



<P>"because the white man is very weak and fell as he rushed upon



<P>me."&nbsp; Then, after a pause, he added, "She is mad with joy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mrs. Almayer, you mean?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, she lives in our Rajah's house.&nbsp; She will not die soon.



<P>Such women live a long time," said Babalatchi, with a slight



<P>tinge of regret in his voice.&nbsp; "She has dollars, and she has



<P>buried them, but we know where.&nbsp; We had much trouble with those



<P>people.&nbsp; We had to pay a fine and listen to threats from the



<P>white men, and now we have to be careful."&nbsp; He sighed and



<P>remained silent for a long while.&nbsp; Then with energy:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There will be fighting.&nbsp; There is a breath of war on the



<P>islands.&nbsp; Shall I live long enough to see? . . . Ah, Tuan!" he



<P>went on, more quietly, "the old times were best.&nbsp; Even I have



<P>sailed with Lanun men, and boarded in the night silent ships with



<P>white sails.&nbsp; That was before an English Rajah ruled in Kuching.



<P>Then we fought amongst ourselves and were happy.&nbsp; Now when we



<P>fight with you we can only die!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He rose to go.&nbsp; "Tuan," he said, "you remember the girl that man



<P>Bulangi had?&nbsp; Her that caused all the trouble?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Ford.&nbsp; "What of her?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She grew thin and could not work.&nbsp; Then Bulangi, who is a thief



<P>and a pig-eater, gave her to me for fifty dollars.&nbsp; I sent her



<P>amongst my women to grow fat.&nbsp; I wanted to hear the sound of her



<P>laughter, but she must have been bewitched, and . . . she died



<P>two days ago.&nbsp; Nay, Tuan.&nbsp; Why do you speak bad words?&nbsp;

I am



<P>old--that is true--but why should I not like the sight of a young



<P>face and the sound of a young voice in my house?"&nbsp; He paused, and



<P>then added with a little mournful laugh, "I am like a white man



<P>talking too much of what is not men's talk when they speak to one



<P>another."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And he went off looking very sad.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The crowd massed in a semicircle before the steps of "Almayer's



<P>Folly," swayed silently backwards and forwards, and opened out



<P>before the group of white-robed and turbaned men advancing



<P>through the grass towards the house.&nbsp; Abdulla walked first,



<P>supported by Reshid and followed by all the Arabs in Sambir.&nbsp; As



<P>they entered the lane made by the respectful throng there was a



<P>subdued murmur of voices, where the word "Mati" was the only one



<P>distinctly audible.&nbsp; Abdulla stopped and looked round slowly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is he dead?" he asked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"May you live!" answered the crowd in one shout, and then there



<P>succeeded a breathless silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Abdulla made a few paces forward and found himself for the last



<P>time face to face with his old enemy.&nbsp; Whatever he might have



<P>been once he was not dangerous now, lying stiff and lifeless in



<P>the tender light of the early day.&nbsp; The only white man on the



<P>east coast was dead, and his soul, delivered from the trammels of



<P>his earthly folly, stood now in the presence of Infinite Wisdom.



<P>On the upturned face there was that serene look which follows the



<P>sudden relief from anguish and pain, and it testified silently



<P>before the cloudless heaven that the man lying there under the



<P>gaze of indifferent eyes had been permitted to forget before he



<P>died.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Abdulla looked down sadly at this Infidel he had fought so long



<P>and had bested so many times.&nbsp; Such was the reward of the



<P>Faithful!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Yet in the Arab's old heart there was a feeling of regret for



<P>that thing gone out of his life.&nbsp; He was leaving fast behind him



<P>friendships, and enmities, successes, and disappointments--all



<P>that makes up a life; and before him was only the end.&nbsp; Prayer



<P>would fill up the remainder of the days allotted to the True



<P>Believer!&nbsp; He took in his hand the beads that hung at his waist.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I found him here, like this, in the morning," said Ali, in a low



<P>and awed voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Abdulla glanced coldly once more at the serene face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let us go," he said, addressing Reshid.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And as they passed through the crowd that fell back before them,



<P>the beads in Abdulla's hand clicked, while in a solemn whisper he



<P>breathed out piously the name of Allah! The Merciful! The Compassionate!

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That year, towards the breaking up of the south-west monsoon,



<P>disquieting rumours reached Sambir.&nbsp; Captain Ford, coming up to



<P>Almayer's house for an evening's chat, brought late numbers of



<P>the Straits Times giving the news of Acheen war and of the



<P>unsuccessful Dutch expedition.&nbsp; The Nakhodas of the rare trading



<P>praus ascending the river paid visits to Lakamba, discussing with



<P>that potentate the unsettled state of affairs, and wagged their



<P>heads gravely over the recital of Orang Blanda exaction,



<P>severity, and general tyranny, as exemplified in the total



<P>stoppage of gunpowder trade and the rigorous visiting of all



<P>suspicious craft trading in the straits of Macassar.&nbsp; Even the



<P>loyal soul of Lakamba was stirred into a state of inward



<P>discontent by the withdrawal of his license for powder and by the



<P>abrupt confiscation of one hundred and fifty barrels of that



<P>commodity by the gunboat Princess Amelia, when, after a hazardous



<P>voyage, it had almost reached the mouth of the river.&nbsp; The



<P>unpleasant news was given him by Reshid, who, after the



<P>unsuccessful issue of his matrimonial projects, had made a long



<P>voyage amongst the islands for trading purposes; had bought the



<P>powder for his friend, and was overhauled and deprived of it on



<P>his return when actually congratulating himself on his acuteness



<P>in avoiding detection.&nbsp; Reshid's wrath was principally directed



<P>against Almayer, whom he suspected of having notified the Dutch



<P>authorities of the desultory warfare carried on by the Arabs and



<P>the Rajah with the up-river Dyak tribes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To Reshid's great surprise the Rajah received his complaints very



<P>coldly, and showed no signs of vengeful disposition towards the



<P>white man.&nbsp; In truth, Lakamba knew very well that Almayer was



<P>perfectly innocent of any meddling in state affairs; and besides,



<P>his attitude towards that much persecuted individual was wholly



<P>changed in&nbsp; consequence of a reconciliation effected between him



<P>and his old enemy by Almayer's newly-found friend, Dain Maroola.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer had now a friend.&nbsp; Shortly after Reshid's departure on



<P>his commercial journey, Nina, drifting slowly with the tide in



<P>the canoe on her return home after one of her solitary



<P>excursions, heard in one of the small creeks a splashing, as if



<P>of heavy ropes dropping in the water, and the prolonged song of



<P>Malay seamen when some heavy pulling is to be done.&nbsp; Through the



<P>thick fringe of bushes hiding the mouth of the creek she saw the



<P>tall spars of some European-rigged sailing vessel overtopping the



<P>summits of the Nipa palms.&nbsp; A brig was being hauled out of the



<P>small creek into the main stream.&nbsp; The sun had set, and during



<P>the short moments of twilight Nina saw the brig, aided by the



<P>evening breeze and the flowing tide, head towards Sambir under



<P>her set foresail.&nbsp; The girl turned her canoe out of the main



<P>river into one of the many narrow channels amongst the wooded



<P>islets, and paddled vigorously over the black and sleepy



<P>backwaters towards Sambir.&nbsp; Her canoe brushed the water-palms,



<P>skirted the short spaces of muddy bank where sedate alligators



<P>looked at her with lazy unconcern, and, just as darkness was



<P>setting in, shot out into the broad junction of the two main



<P>branches of the river, where the brig was already at anchor with



<P>sails furled, yards squared, and decks seemingly untenanted by



<P>any human being.&nbsp; Nina had to cross the river and pass pretty



<P>close to the brig in order to reach home on the low promontory



<P>between the two branches of the Pantai.&nbsp; Up both branches, in the



<P>houses built on the banks and over the water, the lights twinkled



<P>already, reflected in the still waters below.&nbsp; The hum of voices,



<P>the occasional cry of a child, the rapid and abruptly interrupted



<P>roll of a wooden drum, together with some distant hailing in the



<P>darkness by the returning fishermen, reached her over the broad



<P>expanse of the river.&nbsp; She hesitated a little before crossing,



<P>the sight of such an unusual object as an European-rigged vessel



<P>causing her some uneasiness, but the river in its wide expansion



<P>was dark enough to render a small canoe invisible.&nbsp; She urged her



<P>small craft with swift strokes of her paddle, kneeling in the



<P>bottom and bending forward to catch any suspicious sound while



<P>she steered towards the little jetty of Lingard and Co., to which



<P>the strong light of the paraffin lamp shining on the whitewashed



<P>verandah of Almayer's bungalow served as a convenient guide.&nbsp; The



<P>jetty itself, under the shadow of the bank overgrown by drooping



<P>bushes, was hidden in darkness.&nbsp; Before even she could see it she



<P>heard the hollow bumping of a large boat against its rotten



<P>posts, and heard also the murmur of whispered conversation in



<P>that boat whose white paint and great dimensions, faintly visible



<P>on nearer approach, made her rightly guess that it belonged to



<P>the brig just anchored.&nbsp; Stopping her course by a rapid motion

of



<P>her paddle, with another swift stroke she sent it whirling away



<P>from the wharf and steered for a little rivulet which gave access



<P>to the back courtyard of the house.&nbsp; She landed at the muddy head



<P>of the creek and made her way towards the house over the trodden



<P>grass of the courtyard.&nbsp; To the left, from the cooking shed,



<P>shone a red glare through the banana plantation she skirted, and



<P>the noise of feminine laughter reached her from there in the



<P>silent evening.&nbsp; She rightly judged her mother was not near,



<P>laughter and Mrs. Almayer not being close neighbours.&nbsp; She must



<P>be in the house, thought Nina, as she ran lightly up the inclined



<P>plane of shaky planks leading to the back door of the narrow



<P>passage dividing the house in two.&nbsp; Outside the doorway, in the



<P>black shadow, stood the faithful Ali.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who is there?" asked Nina.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A great Malay man has come," answered Ali, in a tone of



<P>suppressed excitement.&nbsp; "He is a rich man.&nbsp; There are six

men



<P>with lances.&nbsp; Real Soldat, you understand.&nbsp; And his dress

is very



<P>brave.&nbsp; I have seen his dress.&nbsp; It shines!&nbsp; What jewels!&nbsp;

Don't



<P>go there, Mem Nina.&nbsp; Tuan said not; but the old Mem is gone.



<P>Tuan will be angry.&nbsp; Merciful Allah! what jewels that man has



<P>got!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina slipped past the outstretched hand of the slave into the



<P>dark passage where, in the crimson glow of the hanging curtain,



<P>close by its other end, she could see a small dark form crouching



<P>near the wall.&nbsp; Her mother was feasting her eyes and ears with



<P>what was taking place on the front verandah, and Nina approached



<P>to take her share in the rare pleasure of some novelty.&nbsp; She was



<P>met by her mother's extended arm and by a low murmured warning



<P>not to make a noise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you seen them, mother?" asked Nina, in a breathless



<P>whisper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Almayer turned her face towards the girl, and her sunken



<P>eyes shone strangely in the red half-light of the passage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I saw him," she said, in an almost inaudible tone, pressing her



<P>daughter's hand with her bony fingers.&nbsp; "A great Rajah has come



<P>to Sambir--a Son of Heaven," muttered the old woman to herself.



<P>"Go away, girl!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The two women stood close to the curtain, Nina wishing to



<P>approach the rent in the stuff, and her mother defending the



<P>position with angry obstinacy.&nbsp; On the other side there was a



<P>lull in the conversation, but the breathing of several men, the



<P>occasional light tinkling of some ornaments, the clink of metal



<P>scabbards, or of brass siri-vessels passed from hand to hand, was



<P>audible during the short pause.&nbsp; The women struggled silently,



<P>when there was a shuffling noise and the shadow of Almayer's



<P>burly form fell on the curtain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The women ceased struggling and remained motionless.&nbsp; Almayer had



<P>stood up to answer his guest, turning his back to the doorway,



<P>unaware of what was going on on the other side.&nbsp; He spoke in a



<P>tone of regretful irritation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have come to the wrong house, Tuan Maroola, if you want to



<P>trade as you say.&nbsp; I was a trader once, not now, whatever you may



<P>have heard about me in Macassar.&nbsp; And if you want anything, you



<P>will not find it here; I have nothing to give, and want nothing



<P>myself.&nbsp; You should go to the Rajah here; you can see in the



<P>daytime his houses across the river, there, where those fires are



<P>burning on the shore.&nbsp; He will help you and trade with you.&nbsp;

Or,



<P>better still, go to the Arabs over there," he went on bitterly,



<P>pointing with his hand towards the houses of Sambir.&nbsp; "Abdulla

is



<P>the man you want.&nbsp; There is nothing he would not buy, and there



<P>is nothing he would not sell; believe me, I know him well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He waited for an answer a short time, then added--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All that I have said is true, and there is nothing more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina, held back by her mother, heard a soft voice reply with a



<P>calm evenness of intonation peculiar to the better class Malays--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who would doubt a white Tuan's words?&nbsp; A man seeks his friends



<P>where his heart tells him.&nbsp; Is this not true also?&nbsp; I have

come,



<P>although so late, for I have something to say which you may be



<P>glad to hear.&nbsp; To-morrow I will go to the Sultan; a trader wants



<P>the friendship of great men.&nbsp; Then I shall return here to speak



<P>serious words, if Tuan permits.&nbsp; I shall not go to the Arabs;



<P>their lies are very great!&nbsp; What are they?&nbsp; Chelakka!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer's voice sounded a little more pleasantly in reply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, as you like.&nbsp; I can hear you to-morrow at any time if you



<P>have anything to say.&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; After you have seen the Sultan



<P>Lakamba you will not want to return here, Inchi Dain.&nbsp; You will



<P>see.&nbsp; Only mind, I will have nothing to do with Lakamba.&nbsp;

You may



<P>tell him so.&nbsp; What is your business with me, after all?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To-morrow we talk, Tuan, now I know you," answered the Malay.



<P>"I speak English a little, so we can talk and nobody will



<P>understand, and then--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He interrupted himself suddenly, asking surprised, "What's that



<P>noise, Tuan?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer had also heard the increasing noise of the scuffle



<P>recommenced on the women's side of the curtain.&nbsp; Evidently Nina's



<P>strong curiosity was on the point of overcoming Mrs. Almayer's



<P>exalted sense of social proprieties.&nbsp; Hard breathing was



<P>distinctly audible, and the curtain shook during the contest,



<P>which was mainly physical, although Mrs. Almayer's voice was



<P>heard in angry remonstrance with its usual want of strictly



<P>logical reasoning, but with the well-known richness of invective.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You shameless woman!&nbsp; Are you a slave?" shouted shrilly the



<P>irate matron.&nbsp; "Veil your face, abandoned wretch!&nbsp; You white



<P>snake, I will not let you!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer's face expressed annoyance and also doubt as to the



<P>advisability of interfering between mother and daughter.&nbsp; He



<P>glanced at his Malay visitor, who was waiting silently for the



<P>end of the uproar in an attitude of amused expectation, and



<P>waving his hand contemptuously he murmured--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is nothing.&nbsp; Some women."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Malay nodded his head gravely, and his face assumed an



<P>expression of serene indifference, as etiquette demanded after



<P>such an explanation.&nbsp; The contest was ended behind the curtain,



<P>and evidently the younger will had its way, for the rapid shuffle



<P>and click of Mrs. Almayer's high-heeled sandals died away in the



<P>distance.&nbsp; The tranquillised master of the house was going to



<P>resume the conversation when, struck by an unexpected change in



<P>the expression of his guest's countenance, he turned his head and



<P>saw Nina standing in the doorway.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After Mrs. Almayer's retreat from the field of battle, Nina, with



<P>a contemptuous exclamation, "It's only a trader," had lifted the



<P>conquered curtain and now stood in full light, framed in the dark



<P>background on the passage, her lips slightly parted, her hair in



<P>disorder after the exertion, the angry gleam not yet faded out of



<P>her glorious and sparkling eyes.&nbsp; She took in at a glance the



<P>group of white-clad lancemen standing motionless in the shadow of



<P>the far-off end of the verandah, and her gaze rested curiously on



<P>the chief of that imposing cortege.&nbsp; He stood, almost facing her,



<P>a little on one side, and struck by the beauty of the unexpected



<P>apparition had bent low, elevating his joint hands above his head



<P>in a sign of respect accorded by Malays only to the great of this



<P>earth.&nbsp; The crude light of the lamp shone on the gold embroidery



<P>of his black silk jacket, broke in a thousand sparkling rays on



<P>the jewelled hilt of his kriss protruding from under the many



<P>folds of the red sarong gathered into a sash round his waist, and



<P>played on the precious stones of the many rings on his dark



<P>fingers.&nbsp; He straightened himself up quickly after the low bow,



<P>putting his hand with a graceful ease on the hilt of his heavy



<P>short sword ornamented with brilliantly dyed fringes of



<P>horsehair.&nbsp; Nina, hesitating on the threshold, saw an erect lithe



<P>figure of medium height with a breadth of shoulder suggesting



<P>great power.&nbsp; Under the folds of a blue turban, whose fringed



<P>ends hung gracefully over the left shoulder, was a face full of



<P>determination and expressing a reckless good-humour, not devoid,



<P>however, of some dignity.&nbsp; The squareness of lower jaw, the full



<P>red lips, the mobile nostrils, and the proud carriage of the head



<P>gave the impression of a being half-savage, untamed, perhaps



<P>cruel, and corrected the liquid softness of the almost feminine



<P>eye, that general characteristic of the race.&nbsp; Now, the first



<P>surprise over, Nina saw those eyes fixed upon her with such an



<P>uncontrolled expression of admiration and desire that she felt a



<P>hitherto unknown feeling of shyness, mixed with alarm and some



<P>delight, enter and penetrate her whole being.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Confused by those unusual sensations she stopped in the doorway



<P>and instinctively drew the lower part of the curtain across her



<P>face, leaving only half a rounded cheek, a stray tress, and one



<P>eye exposed, wherewith to contemplate the gorgeous and bold being



<P>so unlike in appearance to the rare specimens of traders she had



<P>seen before on that same verandah.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dain Maroola, dazzled by the unexpected vision, forgot the



<P>confused Almayer, forgot his brig, his escort staring in



<P>open-mouthed admiration, the object of his visit and all things



<P>else, in his overpowering desire to prolong the contemplation of



<P>so much loveliness met so suddenly in such an unlikely place--as



<P>he thought.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is my daughter," said Almayer, in an embarrassed manner.&nbsp; "It



<P>is of no consequence.&nbsp; White women have their customs, as you



<P>know Tuan, having travelled much, as you say.&nbsp; However, it is



<P>late; we will finish our talk to-morrow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dain bent low trying to convey in a last glance towards the girl



<P>the bold expression of his overwhelming admiration.&nbsp; The next



<P>minute he was shaking Almayer's hand with grave courtesy, his



<P>face wearing a look of stolid unconcern as to any feminine



<P>presence.&nbsp; His men filed off, and he followed them quickly,



<P>closely attended by a thick-set, savage-looking Sumatrese he had



<P>introduced before as the commander of his brig.&nbsp; Nina walked to



<P>the balustrade of the verandah and saw the sheen of moonlight on



<P>the steel spear-heads and heard the rhythmic jingle of brass



<P>anklets as the men moved in single file towards the jetty.&nbsp; The



<P>boat shoved off after a little while, looming large in the full



<P>light of the moon, a black shapeless mass in the slight haze



<P>hanging over the water.&nbsp; Nina fancied she could distinguish the



<P>graceful figure of the trader standing erect in the stern sheets,



<P>but in a little while all the outlines got blurred, confused, and



<P>soon disappeared in the folds of white vapour shrouding the



<P>middle of the river.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer had approached his daughter, and leaning with both arms



<P>over the rail, was looking moodily down on the heap of rubbish



<P>and broken bottles at the foot of the verandah.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What was all that noise just now?" he growled peevishly, without



<P>looking up.&nbsp; "Confound you and your mother!&nbsp; What did she

want?



<P>What did you come out for?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She did not want to let me come out," said Nina.&nbsp; "She is angry.



<P>She says the man just gone is some Rajah.&nbsp; I think she is right



<P>now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I believe all you women are crazy," snarled Almayer.&nbsp; "What's



<P>that to you, to her, to anybody?&nbsp; The man wants to collect



<P>trepang and birds' nests on the islands.&nbsp; He told me so, that



<P>Rajah of yours.&nbsp; He will come to-morrow.&nbsp; I want you both

to keep



<P>away from the house, and let me attend to my business in peace."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dain Maroola came the next day and had a long conversation with



<P>Almayer.&nbsp; This was the beginning of a close and friendly



<P>intercourse which, at first, was much remarked in Sambir, till



<P>the population got used to the frequent sight of many fires



<P>burning in Almayer's campong, where Maroola's men were warming



<P>themselves during the cold nights of the north-east monsoon,



<P>while their master had long conferences with the Tuan Putih--as



<P>they styled Almayer amongst themselves.&nbsp; Great was the curiosity



<P>in Sambir on the subject of the new trader.&nbsp; Had he seen the



<P>Sultan?&nbsp; What did the Sultan say?&nbsp; Had he given any presents?



<P>What would he sell? What would he buy? Those were the questions



<P>broached eagerly by the inhabitants of bamboo houses built over



<P>the river.&nbsp; Even in more substantial buildings, in Abdulla's



<P>house, in the residences of principal traders, Arab, Chinese, and



<P>Bugis, the excitement ran high, and lasted many days.&nbsp; With



<P>inborn suspicion they would not believe the simple account of



<P>himself the young trader was always ready to give.&nbsp; Yet it had



<P>all the appearance of truth.&nbsp; He said he was a trader, and sold



<P>rice.&nbsp; He did not want to buy gutta-percha or beeswax, because

he



<P>intended to employ his numerous crew in collecting trepang on the



<P>coral reefs outside the river, and also in seeking for bird's



<P>nests on the mainland.&nbsp; Those two articles he professed himself



<P>ready to buy if there were any to be obtained in that way.&nbsp; He



<P>said he was from Bali, and a Brahmin, which last statement he



<P>made good by refusing all food during his often repeated visits



<P>to Lakamba's and Almayer's houses.&nbsp; To Lakamba he went generally



<P>at night and had long audiences.&nbsp; Babalatchi, who was always a



<P>third party at those meetings of potentate and trader, knew how



<P>to resist all attempts on the part of the curious to ascertain



<P>the subject of so many long talks.&nbsp; When questioned with languid



<P>courtesy by the grave Abdulla he sought refuge in a vacant stare



<P>of his one eye, and in the affectation of extreme simplicity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am only my master's slave," murmured Babalatchi, in a



<P>hesitating manner.&nbsp; Then as if making up his mind suddenly for

a



<P>reckless confidence he would inform Abdulla of some transaction



<P>in rice, repeating the words, "A hundred big bags the Sultan



<P>bought; a hundred, Tuan!" in a tone of mysterious solemnity.



<P>Abdulla, firmly persuaded of the existence of some more important



<P>dealings, received, however, the information with all the signs



<P>of respectful astonishment.&nbsp; And the two would separate, the Arab



<P>cursing inwardly the wily dog, while Babalatchi went on his way



<P>walking on the dusty path, his body swaying, his chin with its



<P>few grey hairs pushed forward, resembling an inquisitive goat



<P>bent on some unlawful expedition.&nbsp; Attentive eyes watched his



<P>movements.&nbsp; Jim-Eng, descrying Babalatchi far away, would shake



<P>off the stupor of an habitual opium smoker and, tottering on to



<P>the middle of the road, would await the approach of that



<P>important person, ready with hospitable invitation.&nbsp; But



<P>Babalatchi's discretion was proof even against the combined



<P>assaults of good fellowship and of strong gin generously



<P>administered by the open-hearted Chinaman.&nbsp; Jim-Eng, owning



<P>himself beaten, was left uninformed with the empty bottle, and



<P>gazed sadly after the departing form of the statesman of Sambir



<P>pursuing his devious and unsteady way, which, as usual, led him



<P>to Almayer's compound.&nbsp; Ever since a reconciliation had been



<P>effected by Dain Maroola between his white friend and the Rajah,



<P>the one-eyed diplomatist had again become a frequent guest in the



<P>Dutchman's house.&nbsp; To Almayer's great disgust he was to be seen



<P>there at all times, strolling about in an abstracted kind of way



<P>on the verandah, skulking in the passages, or else popping round



<P>unexpected corners, always willing to engage Mrs. Almayer in



<P>confidential conversation.&nbsp; He was very shy of the master



<P>himself, as if suspicious that the pent-up feelings of the white



<P>man towards his person might find vent in a sudden kick.&nbsp; But the



<P>cooking shed was his favourite place, and he became an habitual



<P>guest there, squatting for hours amongst the busy women, with his



<P>chin resting on his knees, his lean arms clasped round his legs,



<P>and his one eye roving uneasily--the very picture of watchful



<P>ugliness.&nbsp; Almayer wanted more than once to complain to Lakamba



<P>of his Prime Minister's intrusion, but Dain dissuaded him.&nbsp; "We



<P>cannot say a word here that he does not hear," growled Almayer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then come and talk on board the brig," retorted Dain, with a



<P>quiet smile.&nbsp; "It is good to let the man come here.&nbsp; Lakamba



<P>thinks he knows much.&nbsp; Perhaps the Sultan thinks I want to run



<P>away.&nbsp; Better let the one-eyed crocodile sun himself in your



<P>campong, Tuan."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And Almayer assented unwillingly muttering vague threats of



<P>personal violence, while he eyed malevolently the aged statesman



<P>sitting with quiet obstinacy by his domestic rice-pot.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>"It has set at last," said Nina to her mother pointing towards



<P>the hills behind which the sun had sunk.&nbsp; "Listen, mother, I am



<P>going now to Bulangi's creek, and if I should never return--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She interrupted herself, and something like doubt dimmed for a



<P>moment the fire of suppressed exaltation that had glowed in her



<P>eyes and had illuminated the serene impassiveness of her features



<P>with a ray of eager life during all that long day of excitement--



<P>the day of joy and anxiety, of hope and terror, of vague grief



<P>and indistinct delight.&nbsp; While the sun shone with that dazzling



<P>light in which her love was born and grew till it possessed her



<P>whole being, she was kept firm in her unwavering resolve by the



<P>mysterious whisperings of desire which filled her heart with



<P>impatient longing for the darkness that would mean the end of



<P>danger and strife, the beginning of happiness, the fulfilling of



<P>love, the completeness of life.&nbsp; It had set at last!&nbsp; The

short



<P>tropical twilight went out before she could draw the long breath



<P>of relief; and now the sudden darkness seemed to be full of



<P>menacing voices calling upon her to rush headlong into the



<P>unknown; to be true to her own impulses, to give herself up to



<P>the passion she had evoked and shared.&nbsp; He was waiting!&nbsp; In

the



<P>solitude of the secluded clearing, in the vast silence of the



<P>forest he was waiting alone, a fugitive in fear of his life.



<P>Indifferent to his danger he was waiting for her.&nbsp; It was for her



<P>only that he had come; and now as the time approached when he



<P>should have his reward, she asked herself with dismay what meant



<P>that chilling doubt of her own will and of her own desire?&nbsp; With



<P>an effort she shook off the fear of the passing weakness.&nbsp; He



<P>should have his reward.&nbsp; Her woman's love and her woman's honour



<P>overcame the faltering distrust of that unknown future waiting



<P>for her in the darkness of the river.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, you will not return," muttered Mrs. Almayer, prophetically.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Without you he will not go, and if he remains here--"&nbsp; She waved



<P>her hand towards the lights of "Almayer's Folly," and the



<P>unfinished sentence died out in a threatening murmur.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The two women had met behind the house, and now were walking



<P>slowly together towards the creek where all the canoes were



<P>moored.&nbsp; Arrived at the fringe of bushes they stopped by a common



<P>impulse, and Mrs. Almayer, laying her hand on her daughter's arm,



<P>tried in vain to look close into the girl's averted face.&nbsp; When



<P>she attempted to speak her first words were lost in a stifled sob



<P>that sounded strangely coming from that woman who, of all human



<P>passions, seemed to know only those of anger and hate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are going away to be a great Ranee," she said at last, in a



<P>voice that was steady enough now, "and if you be wise you shall



<P>have much power that will endure many days, and even last into



<P>your old age.&nbsp; What have I been?&nbsp; A slave all my life, and

I have



<P>cooked rice for a man who had no courage and no wisdom.&nbsp; Hai!&nbsp;

I!



<P>even I, was given in gift by a chief and a warrior to a man that



<P>was neither.&nbsp; Hai!&nbsp; Hai!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She wailed to herself softly, lamenting the lost possibilities of



<P>murder and mischief that could have fallen to her lot had she



<P>been mated with a congenial spirit.&nbsp; Nina bent down over Mrs.



<P>Almayer's slight form and scanned attentively, under the stars



<P>that had rushed out on the black sky and now hung breathless over



<P>that strange parting, her mother's shrivelled features, and



<P>looked close into the sunken eyes that could see into her own



<P>dark future by the light of a long and a painful experience.



<P>Again she felt herself fascinated, as of old, by her mother's



<P>exalted mood and by the oracular certainty of expression which,



<P>together with her fits of violence, had contributed not a little



<P>to the reputation for witchcraft she enjoyed in the settlement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was a slave, and you shall be a queen," went on Mrs. Almayer,



<P>looking straight before her; "but remember men's strength and



<P>their weakness.&nbsp; Tremble before his anger, so that he may see



<P>your fear in the light of day; but in your heart you may laugh,



<P>for after sunset he is your slave."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A slave!&nbsp; He!&nbsp; The master of life!&nbsp; You do not know

him,



<P>mother."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Almayer condescended to laugh contemptuously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You speak like a fool of a white woman," she exclaimed.&nbsp; "What



<P>do you know of men's anger and of men's love?&nbsp; Have you watched



<P>the sleep of men weary of dealing death?&nbsp; Have you felt about you



<P>the strong arm that could drive a kriss deep into a beating



<P>heart?&nbsp; Yah! you are a white woman, and ought to pray to a



<P>woman-god!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why do you say this?&nbsp; I have listened to your words so long that



<P>I have forgotten my old life.&nbsp; If I was white would I stand here,



<P>ready to go?&nbsp; Mother, I shall return to the house and look once



<P>more at my father's face."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No!" said Mrs. Almayer, violently.&nbsp; "No, he sleeps now the sleep



<P>of gin; and if you went back he might awake and see you.&nbsp; No, he



<P>shall never see you.&nbsp; When the terrible old man took you away



<P>from me when you were little, you remember--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was such a long time ago," murmured Nina.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I remember," went on Mrs. Almayer, fiercely.&nbsp; "I wanted to look



<P>at your face again.&nbsp; He said no!&nbsp; I heard you cry and jumped

into



<P>the river.&nbsp; You were his daughter then; you are my daughter now.



<P>Never shall you go back to that house; you shall never cross this



<P>courtyard again.&nbsp; No! no!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her voice rose almost to a shout.&nbsp; On the other side of the creek



<P>there was a rustle in the long grass.&nbsp; The two women heard it,



<P>and listened for a while in startled silence.&nbsp; "I shall go," said



<P>Nina, in a cautious but intense whisper.&nbsp; "What is your hate or



<P>your revenge to me?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She moved towards the house, Mrs. Almayer clinging to her and



<P>trying to pull her back.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Stop, you shall not go!" she gasped.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina pushed away her mother impatiently and gathered up her



<P>skirts for a quick run, but Mrs. Almayer ran forward and turned



<P>round, facing her daughter with outstretched arms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you move another step," she exclaimed, breathing quickly, "I



<P>shall cry out.&nbsp; Do you see those lights in the big house?&nbsp;

There



<P>sit two white men, angry because they cannot have the blood of



<P>the man you love.&nbsp; And in those dark houses," she continued, more



<P>calmly as she pointed towards the settlement, "my voice could



<P>wake up men that would lead the Orang Blanda soldiers to him who



<P>is waiting--for you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could not see her daughter's face, but the white figure



<P>before her stood silent and irresolute in the darkness.&nbsp; Mrs.



<P>Almayer pursued her advantage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Give up your old life!&nbsp; Forget!" she said in entreating tones.



<P>"Forget that you ever looked at a white face; forget their words;



<P>forget their thoughts.&nbsp; They speak lies.&nbsp; And they think lies



<P>because they despise us that are better than they are, but not so



<P>strong.&nbsp; Forget their friendship and their contempt; forget their



<P>many gods.&nbsp; Girl, why do you want to remember the past when there



<P>is a warrior and a chief ready to give many lives--his own life--



<P>for one of your smiles?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While she spoke she pushed gently her daughter towards the



<P>canoes, hiding her own fear, anxiety, and doubt under the flood



<P>of passionate words that left Nina no time to think and no



<P>opportunity to protest, even if she had wished it.&nbsp; But she did



<P>not wish it now.&nbsp; At the bottom of that passing desire to look



<P>again at her father's face there was no strong affection.&nbsp; She



<P>felt no scruples and no remorse at leaving suddenly that man



<P>whose sentiment towards herself she could not understand, she



<P>could not even see.&nbsp; There was only an instinctive clinging to



<P>old life, to old habits, to old faces; that fear of finality



<P>which lurks in every human breast and prevents so many heroisms



<P>and so many crimes.&nbsp; For years she had stood between her mother



<P>and her father, the one so strong in her weakness, the other so



<P>weak where he could have been strong.&nbsp; Between those two beings



<P>so dissimilar, so antagonistic, she stood with mute heart



<P>wondering and angry at the fact of her own existence.&nbsp; It seemed



<P>so unreasonable, so humiliating to be flung there in that



<P>settlement and to see the days rush by into the past, without a



<P>hope, a desire, or an aim that would justify the life she had to



<P>endure in ever-growing weariness.&nbsp; She had little belief and no



<P>sympathy for her father's dreams; but the savage ravings of her



<P>mother chanced to strike a responsive chord, deep down somewhere



<P>in her despairing heart; and she dreamed dreams of her own with



<P>the persistent absorption of a captive thinking of liberty within



<P>the walls of his prison cell.&nbsp; With the coming of Dain she found



<P>the road to freedom by obeying the voice of the new-born



<P>impulses, and with surprised joy she thought she could read in



<P>his eyes the answer to all the questionings of her heart.&nbsp; She



<P>understood now the reason and the aim of life; and in the



<P>triumphant unveiling of that mystery she threw away disdainfully



<P>her past with its sad thoughts, its bitter feelings, and its



<P>faint affections, now withered and dead in contact with her



<P>fierce passion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Almayer unmoored Nina's own canoe and, straightening herself



<P>painfully, stood, painter in hand, looking at her daughter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Quick," she said; "get away before the moon rises, while the



<P>river is dark.&nbsp; I am afraid of Abdulla's slaves.&nbsp; The wretches



<P>prowl in the night often, and might see and follow you.&nbsp; There



<P>are two paddles in the canoe."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina approached her mother and hesitatingly touched lightly with



<P>her lips the wrinkled forehead.&nbsp; Mrs. Almayer snorted



<P>contemptuously in protest against that tenderness which she,



<P>nevertheless, feared could be contagious.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shall I ever see you again, mother?" murmured Nina.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," said Mrs. Almayer, after a short silence.&nbsp; "Why should you



<P>return here where it is my fate to die?&nbsp; You will live far away



<P>in splendour and might.&nbsp; When I hear of white men driven from the



<P>islands, then I shall know that you are alive, and that you



<P>remember my words."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall always remember," returned Nina, earnestly; "but where



<P>is my power, and what can I do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do not let him look too long in your eyes, nor lay his head on



<P>your knees without reminding him that men should fight before



<P>they rest.&nbsp; And if he lingers, give him his kriss yourself and



<P>bid him go, as the wife of a mighty prince should do when the



<P>enemies are near.&nbsp; Let him slay the white men that come to us to



<P>trade, with prayers on their lips and loaded guns in their hands.



<P>Ah!"--she ended with a sigh--"they are on every sea, and on every



<P>shore; and they are very many!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She swung the bow of the canoe towards the river, but did not let



<P>go the gunwale, keeping her hand on it in irresolute



<P>thoughtfulness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina put the point of the paddle against the bank, ready to shove



<P>off into the stream.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is it, mother?" she asked, in a low voice.&nbsp; "Do you hear



<P>anything?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," said Mrs. Almayer, absently.&nbsp; "Listen, Nina," she



<P>continued, abruptly, after a slight pause, "in after years there



<P>will be other women--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A stifled cry in the boat interrupted her, and the paddle rattled



<P>in the canoe as it slipped from Nina's hands, which she put out



<P>in a protesting gesture.&nbsp; Mrs. Almayer fell on her knees on the



<P>bank and leaned over the gunwale so as to bring her own face



<P>close to her daughter's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There will be other women," she repeated firmly; "I tell you



<P>that, because you are half white, and may forget that he is a



<P>great chief, and that such things must be.&nbsp; Hide your anger, and



<P>do not let him see on your face the pain that will eat your



<P>heart.&nbsp; Meet him with joy in your eyes and wisdom on your lips,



<P>for to you he will turn in sadness or in doubt.&nbsp; As long as he



<P>looks upon many women your power will last, but should there be



<P>one, one only with whom he seems to forget you, then--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I could not live," exclaimed Nina, covering her face with both



<P>her hands.&nbsp; "Do not speak so, mother; it could not be."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then," went on Mrs. Almayer, steadily, "to that woman, Nina,



<P>show no mercy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She moved the canoe down towards the stream by the gunwale, and



<P>gripped it with both her hands, the bow pointing into the river.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you crying?" she asked sternly of her daughter, who sat



<P>still with covered face.&nbsp; "Arise, and take your paddle, for he



<P>has waited long enough.&nbsp; And remember, Nina, no mercy; and if you



<P>must strike, strike with a steady hand."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She put out all her strength, and swinging her body over the



<P>water, shot the light craft far into the stream.&nbsp; When she



<P>recovered herself from the effort she tried vainly to catch a



<P>glimpse of the canoe that seemed to have dissolved suddenly into



<P>the white mist trailing over the heated waters of the Pantai.



<P>After listening for a while intently on her knees, Mrs. Almayer



<P>rose with a deep sigh, while two tears wandered slowly down her



<P>withered cheeks.&nbsp; She wiped them off quickly with a wisp of her



<P>grey hair as if ashamed of herself, but could not stifle another



<P>loud sigh, for her heart was heavy and she suffered much, being



<P>unused to tender emotions.&nbsp; This time she fancied she had heard

a



<P>faint noise, like the echo of her own sigh, and she stopped,



<P>straining her ears to catch the slightest sound, and peering



<P>apprehensively towards the bushes near her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who is there?" she asked, in an unsteady voice, while her



<P>imagination peopled the solitude of the riverside with ghost-like



<P>forms.&nbsp; "Who is there?" she repeated faintly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was no answer:&nbsp; only the voice of the river murmuring in



<P>sad monotone behind the white veil seemed to swell louder for a



<P>moment, to die away again in a soft whisper of eddies washing



<P>against the bank.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Almayer shook her head as if in answer to her own thoughts,



<P>and walked quickly away from the bushes, looking to the right and



<P>left watchfully.&nbsp; She went straight towards the cooking-shed,



<P>observing that the embers of the fire there glowed more brightly



<P>than usual, as if somebody had been adding fresh fuel to the



<P>fires during the evening.&nbsp; As she approached, Babalatchi, who had



<P>been squatting in the warm glow, rose and met her in the shadow



<P>outside.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is she gone?" asked the anxious statesman, hastily.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," answered Mrs. Almayer.&nbsp; "What are the white men doing?



<P>When did you leave them?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They are sleeping now, I think.&nbsp; May they never wake!" exclaimed



<P>Babalatchi, fervently.&nbsp; "Oh! but they are devils, and made much



<P>talk and trouble over that carcase.&nbsp; The chief threatened me



<P>twice with his hand, and said he would have me tied up to a tree.



<P>Tie me up to a tree!&nbsp; Me!" he repeated, striking his breast



<P>violently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Almayer laughed tauntingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And you salaamed and asked for mercy.&nbsp; Men with arms by their



<P>side acted otherwise when I was young."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And where are they, the men of your youth?&nbsp; You mad woman!"



<P>retorted Babalatchi, angrily.&nbsp; "Killed by the Dutch.&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp;

But I



<P>shall live to deceive them.&nbsp; A man knows when to fight and when



<P>to tell peaceful lies.&nbsp; You would know that if you were not a



<P>woman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Mrs. Almayer did not seem to hear him.&nbsp; With bent body and



<P>outstretched arm she appeared to be listening to some noise



<P>behind the shed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There are strange sounds," she whispered, with evident alarm.



<P>"I have heard in the air the sounds of grief, as of a sigh and



<P>weeping.&nbsp; That was by the riverside.&nbsp; And now again I heard--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where?" asked Babalatchi, in an altered voice.&nbsp; "What did you



<P>hear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Close here.&nbsp; It was like a breath long drawn.&nbsp; I wish I had



<P>burnt the paper over the body before it was buried."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," assented Babalatchi.&nbsp; "But the white men had him thrown



<P>into a hole at once.&nbsp; You know he found his death on the river,"



<P>he added cheerfully, "and his ghost may hail the canoes, but



<P>would leave the land alone."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Almayer, who had been craning her neck to look round the



<P>corner of the shed, drew back her head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is nobody there," she said, reassured.&nbsp; "Is it not time



<P>for the Rajah war-canoe to go to the clearing?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have been waiting for it here, for I myself must go,"



<P>explained Babalatchi.&nbsp; "I think I will go over and see what makes



<P>them late.&nbsp; When will you come?&nbsp; The Rajah gives you refuge."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall paddle over before the break of day.&nbsp; I cannot leave my



<P>dollars behind," muttered Mrs. Almayer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They separated.&nbsp; Babalatchi crossed the courtyard towards the



<P>creek to get his canoe, and Mrs. Almayer walked slowly to the



<P>house, ascended the plankway, and passing through the back



<P>verandah entered the passage leading to the front of the house;



<P>but before going in she turned in the doorway and looked back at



<P>the empty and silent courtyard, now lit up by the rays of the



<P>rising moon.&nbsp; No sooner she had disappeared, however, than a



<P>vague shape flitted out from amongst the stalks of the banana



<P>plantation, darted over the moonlit space, and fell in the



<P>darkness at the foot of the verandah.&nbsp; It might have been the



<P>shadow of a driving cloud, so noiseless and rapid was its



<P>passage, but for the trail of disturbed grass, whose feathery



<P>heads trembled and swayed for a long time in the moonlight before



<P>they rested motionless and gleaming, like a design of silver



<P>sprays embroidered on a sombre background.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Almayer lighted the cocoanut lamp, and lifting cautiously



<P>the red curtain, gazed upon her husband, shading the light with



<P>her hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer, huddled up in the chair, one of his arms hanging down,



<P>the other thrown across the lower part of his face as if to ward



<P>off an invisible enemy, his legs stretched straight out, slept



<P>heavily, unconscious of the unfriendly eyes that looked upon him



<P>in disparaging criticism.&nbsp; At his feet lay the overturned table,



<P>amongst a wreck of crockery and broken bottles.&nbsp; The appearance



<P>as of traces left by a desperate struggle was accentuated by the



<P>chairs, which seemed to have been scattered violently all over



<P>the place, and now lay about the verandah with a lamentable



<P>aspect of inebriety in their helpless attitudes.&nbsp; Only Nina's big



<P>rocking-chair, standing black and motionless on its high runners,



<P>towered above the chaos of demoralised furniture, unflinchingly



<P>dignified and patient, waiting for its burden.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With a last scornful look towards the sleeper, Mrs. Almayer



<P>passed behind the curtain into her own room.&nbsp; A couple of bats,



<P>encouraged by the darkness and the peaceful state of affairs,



<P>resumed their silent and oblique gambols above Almayer's head,



<P>and for a long time the profound quiet of the house was unbroken,



<P>save for the deep breathing of the sleeping man and the faint



<P>tinkle of silver in the hands of the woman preparing for flight.



<P>In the increasing light of the moon that had risen now above the



<P>night mist, the objects on the verandah came out strongly



<P>outlined in black splashes of shadow with all the uncompromising



<P>ugliness of their disorder, and a caricature of the sleeping



<P>Almayer appeared on the dirty whitewash of the wall behind him in



<P>a grotesquely exaggerated detail of attitude and feature enlarged



<P>to a heroic size.&nbsp; The discontented bats departed in quest of



<P>darker places, and a lizard came out in short, nervous rushes,



<P>and, pleased with the white table-cloth, stopped on it in



<P>breathless immobility that would have suggested sudden death had



<P>it not been for the melodious call he exchanged with a less



<P>adventurous friend hiding amongst the lumber in the courtyard.



<P>Then the boards in the passage creaked, the lizard vanished, and



<P>Almayer stirred uneasily with a sigh:&nbsp; slowly, out of the



<P>senseless annihilation of drunken sleep, he was returning,



<P>through the land of dreams, to waking consciousness.&nbsp; Almayer's



<P>head rolled from shoulder to shoulder in the oppression of his



<P>dream; the heavens had descended upon him like a heavy mantle,



<P>and trailed in starred folds far under him.&nbsp; Stars above, stars



<P>all round him; and from the stars under his feet rose a whisper



<P>full of entreaties and tears, and sorrowful faces flitted amongst



<P>the clusters of light filling the infinite space below.&nbsp; How



<P>escape from the importunity of lamentable cries and from the look



<P>of staring, sad eyes in the faces which pressed round him till he



<P>gasped for breath under the crushing weight of worlds that hung



<P>over his aching shoulders?&nbsp; Get away!&nbsp; But how?&nbsp; If he

attempted



<P>to move he would step off into nothing, and perish in the



<P>crashing fall of that universe of which he was the only support.



<P>And what were the voices saying?&nbsp; Urging him to move!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;

Move



<P>to destruction!&nbsp; Not likely!&nbsp; The absurdity of the thing filled



<P>him with indignation.&nbsp; He got a firmer foothold and stiffened his



<P>muscles in heroic resolve to carry his burden to all eternity.



<P>And ages passed in the superhuman labour, amidst the rush of



<P>circling worlds; in the plaintive murmur of sorrowful voices



<P>urging him to desist before it was too late--till the mysterious



<P>power that had laid upon him the giant task seemed at last to



<P>seek his destruction.&nbsp; With terror he felt an irresistible hand



<P>shaking him by the shoulder, while the chorus of voices swelled



<P>louder into an agonised prayer to go, go before it is too late.



<P>He felt himself slipping, losing his balance, as something



<P>dragged at his legs, and he fell.&nbsp; With a faint cry he glided out



<P>of the anguish of perishing creation into an imperfect waking



<P>that seemed to be still under the spell of his dream.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What?&nbsp; What?" he murmured sleepily, without moving or opening



<P>his eyes.&nbsp; His head still felt heavy, and he had not the courage



<P>to raise his eyelids.&nbsp; In his ears there still lingered the sound



<P>of entreating whisper.--"Am I awake?--Why do I hear the voices?"



<P>he argued to himself, hazily.--"I cannot get rid of the horrible



<P>nightmare yet.--I have been very drunk.--What is that shaking me?



<P>I am dreaming yet--I must open my eyes and be done with it.&nbsp; I

am



<P>only half awake, it is evident."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He made an effort to shake off his stupor and saw a face close to



<P>his, glaring at him with staring eyeballs.&nbsp; He closed his eyes



<P>again in amazed horror and sat up straight in the chair,



<P>trembling in every limb.&nbsp; What was this apparition?--His own



<P>fancy, no doubt.--His nerves had been much tried the day



<P>before--and then the drink!&nbsp; He would not see it again if he had



<P>the courage to look.--He would look directly.--Get a little



<P>steadier first.-- So.--Now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked.&nbsp; The figure of a woman standing in the steely light,



<P>her hands stretched forth in a suppliant gesture, confronted him



<P>from the far-off end of the verandah; and in the space between



<P>him and the obstinate phantom floated the murmur of words that



<P>fell on his ears in a jumble of torturing sentences, the meaning



<P>of which escaped the utmost efforts of his brain.&nbsp; Who spoke the



<P>Malay words?&nbsp; Who ran away?&nbsp; Why too late--and too late for

what?



<P>What meant those words of hate and love mixed so strangely



<P>together, the ever-recurring names falling on his ears again and



<P>again--Nina, Dain; Dain, Nina?&nbsp; Dain was dead, and Nina was



<P>sleeping, unaware of the terrible experience through which he was



<P>now passing.&nbsp; Was he going to be tormented for ever, sleeping or



<P>waking, and have no peace either night or day?&nbsp; What was the



<P>meaning of this?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He shouted the last words aloud.&nbsp; The shadowy woman seemed to



<P>shrink and recede a little from him towards the doorway, and



<P>there was a shriek.&nbsp; Exasperated by the incomprehensible nature



<P>of his torment, Almayer made a rush upon the apparition, which



<P>eluded his grasp, and he brought up heavily against the wall.



<P>Quick as lightning he turned round and pursued fiercely the



<P>mysterious figure fleeing from him with piercing shrieks that



<P>were like fuel to the flames of his anger.&nbsp; Over the furniture,



<P>round the overturned table, and now he had it cornered behind



<P>Nina's chair.&nbsp; To the left, to the right they dodged, the chair



<P>rocking madly between them, she sending out shriek after shriek



<P>at every feint, and he growling meaningless curses through his



<P>hard set teeth.&nbsp; "Oh! the fiendish noise that split his head and



<P>seemed to choke his breath.--It would kill him.--It must be



<P>stopped!"&nbsp; An insane desire to crush that yelling thing induced



<P>him to cast himself recklessly over the chair with a desperate



<P>grab, and they came down together in a cloud of dust amongst the



<P>splintered wood.&nbsp; The last shriek died out under him in a faint



<P>gurgle, and he had secured the relief of absolute silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked at the woman's face under him.&nbsp; A real woman!&nbsp; He

knew



<P>her.&nbsp; By all that is wonderful!&nbsp; Taminah!&nbsp; He jumped

up ashamed



<P>of his fury and stood perplexed, wiping his forehead.&nbsp; The girl



<P>struggled to a kneeling posture and embraced his legs in a



<P>frenzied prayer for mercy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't be afraid," he said, raising her.&nbsp; "I shall not hurt you.



<P>Why do you come to my house in the night?&nbsp; And if you had to



<P>come, why not go behind the curtain where the women sleep?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The place behind the curtain is empty," gasped Taminah, catching



<P>her breath between the words.&nbsp; "There are no women in your house



<P>any more, Tuan.&nbsp; I saw the old Mem go away before I tried to wake



<P>you.&nbsp; I did not want your women, I wanted you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Old Mem!" repeated Almayer.&nbsp; "Do you mean my wife?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She nodded her head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But of my daughter you are not afraid?" said Almayer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you not heard me?" she exclaimed.&nbsp; "Have I not spoken for

a



<P>long time when you lay there with eyes half open?&nbsp; She is gone



<P>too."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was asleep.&nbsp; Can you not tell when a man is sleeping and when



<P>awake?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sometimes," answered Taminah in a low voice; "sometimes the



<P>spirit lingers close to a sleeping body and may hear.&nbsp; I spoke

a



<P>long time before I touched you, and I spoke softly for fear it



<P>would depart at a sudden noise and leave you sleeping for ever.



<P>I took you by the shoulder only when you began to mutter words I



<P>could not understand.&nbsp; Have you not heard, then, and do you know



<P>nothing?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing of what you said.&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Tell again if you

want



<P>me to know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He took her by the shoulder and led her unresisting to the front



<P>of the verandah into a stronger light.&nbsp; She wrung her hands with



<P>such an appearance of grief that he began to be alarmed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Speak," he said.&nbsp; "You made noise enough to wake even dead men.



<P>And yet nobody living came," he added to himself in an uneasy



<P>whisper.&nbsp; "Are you mute?&nbsp; Speak!" he repeated.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a rush of words which broke out after a short struggle from



<P>her trembling lips she told him the tale of Nina's love and her



<P>own jealousy.&nbsp; Several times he looked angrily into her face and



<P>told her to be silent; but he could not stop the sounds that



<P>seemed to him to run out in a hot stream, swirl about his feet,



<P>and rise in scalding waves about him, higher, higher, drowning



<P>his heart, touching his lips with a feel of molten lead, blotting



<P>out his sight in scorching vapour, closing over his head,



<P>merciless and deadly.&nbsp; When she spoke of the deception as to



<P>Dain's death of which he had been the victim only that day, he



<P>glanced again at her with terrible eyes, and made her falter for



<P>a second, but he turned away directly, and his face suddenly lost



<P>all expression in a stony stare far away over the river.&nbsp; Ah! the



<P>river!&nbsp; His old friend and his old enemy, speaking always with



<P>the same voice as he runs from year to year bringing fortune or



<P>disappointment happiness or pain, upon the same varying but



<P>unchanged surface of glancing currents and swirling eddies.&nbsp; For



<P>many years he had listened to the passionless and soothing murmur



<P>that sometimes was the song of hope, at times the song of



<P>triumph, of encouragement; more often the whisper of consolation



<P>that spoke of better days to come.&nbsp; For so many years!&nbsp; So

many



<P>years!&nbsp; And now to the accompaniment of that murmur he listened



<P>to the slow and painful beating of his heart.&nbsp; He listened



<P>attentively, wondering at the regularity of its beats.&nbsp; He began



<P>to count mechanically.&nbsp; One, two.&nbsp; Why count?&nbsp; At the

next beat



<P>it must stop.&nbsp; No heart could suffer so and beat so steadily for



<P>long.&nbsp; Those regular strokes as of a muffled hammer that rang in



<P>his ears must stop soon.&nbsp; Still beating unceasing and cruel.&nbsp;

No



<P>man can bear this; and is this the last, or will the next one be



<P>the last?--How much longer?&nbsp; O God! how much longer?&nbsp; His

hand



<P>weighed heavier unconsciously on the girl's shoulder, and she



<P>spoke the last words of her story crouching at his feet with



<P>tears of pain and shame and anger.&nbsp; Was her revenge to fail her?



<P>This white man was like a senseless stone.&nbsp; Too late!&nbsp; Too

late!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And you saw her go?" Almayer's voice sounded harshly above her



<P>head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did I not tell you?" she sobbed, trying to wriggle gently out



<P>from under his grip.&nbsp; "Did I not tell you that I saw the



<P>witchwoman push the canoe?&nbsp; I lay hidden in the grass and heard



<P>all the words.&nbsp; She that we used to call the white Mem wanted to



<P>return to look at your face, but the witchwoman forbade her,



<P>and--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She sank lower yet on her elbow, turning half round under the



<P>downward push of the heavy hand, her face lifted up to him with



<P>spiteful eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And she obeyed," she shouted out in a half-laugh, half-cry of



<P>pain.&nbsp; "Let me go, Tuan.&nbsp; Why are you angry with me?&nbsp;

Hasten, or



<P>you shall be too late to show your anger to the deceitful woman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer dragged her up to her feet and looked close into her face



<P>while she struggled, turning her head away from his wild stare.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who sent you here to torment me?" he asked, violently.&nbsp; "I do



<P>not believe you.&nbsp; You lie."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He straightened his arm suddenly and flung her across the



<P>verandah towards the doorway, where she lay immobile and silent,



<P>as if she had left her life in his grasp, a dark heap, without a



<P>sound or a stir.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! Nina!" whispered Almayer, in a voice in which reproach and



<P>love spoke together in pained tenderness.&nbsp; "Oh!&nbsp; Nina!&nbsp;

I do not



<P>believe."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A light draught from the river ran over the courtyard in a wave



<P>of bowing grass and, entering the verandah, touched Almayer's



<P>forehead with its cool breath, in a caress of infinite pity.&nbsp; The



<P>curtain in the women's doorway blew out and instantly collapsed



<P>with startling helplessness.&nbsp; He stared at the fluttering stuff.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nina!" cried Almayer.&nbsp; "Where are you, Nina?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The wind passed out of the empty house in a tremulous sigh, and



<P>all was still.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer hid his face in his hands as if to shut out a loathsome



<P>sight.&nbsp; When, hearing a slight rustle, he uncovered his eyes, the



<P>dark heap by the door was gone.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>In the middle of a shadowless square of moonlight, shining on a



<P>smooth and level expanse of young rice-shoots, a little



<P>shelter-hut perched on high posts, the pile of brushwood near by



<P>and the glowing embers of a fire with a man stretched before it,



<P>seemed very small and as if lost in the pale green iridescence



<P>reflected from the ground.&nbsp; On three sides of the clearing,



<P>appearing very far away in the deceptive light, the big trees of



<P>the forest, lashed together with manifold bonds by a mass of



<P>tangled creepers, looked down at the growing young life at their



<P>feet with the sombre resignation of giants that had lost faith in



<P>their strength.&nbsp; And in the midst of them the merciless creepers



<P>clung to the big trunks in cable-like coils, leaped from tree to



<P>tree, hung in thorny festoons from the lower boughs, and, sending



<P>slender tendrils on high to seek out the smallest branches,



<P>carried death to their victims in an exulting riot of silent



<P>destruction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the fourth side, following the curve of the bank of that



<P>branch of the Pantai that formed the only access to the clearing,



<P>ran a black line of young trees, bushes, and thick second growth,



<P>unbroken save for a small gap chopped out in one place.&nbsp; At that



<P>gap began the narrow footpath leading from the water's edge to



<P>the grass-built shelter used by the night watchers when the



<P>ripening crop had to be protected from the wild pigs.&nbsp; The



<P>pathway ended at the foot of the piles on which the hut was



<P>built, in a circular space covered with ashes and bits of burnt



<P>wood.&nbsp; In the middle of that space, by the dim fire, lay Dain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He turned over on his side with an impatient sigh, and, pillowing



<P>his head on his bent arm, lay quietly with his face to the dying



<P>fire.&nbsp; The glowing embers shone redly in a small circle, throwing



<P>a gleam into his wide-open eyes, and at every deep breath the



<P>fine white ash of bygone fires rose in a light cloud before his



<P>parted lips, and danced away from the warm glow into the



<P>moonbeams pouring down upon Bulangi's clearing.&nbsp; His body was



<P>weary with the exertion of the past few days, his mind more weary



<P>still with the strain of solitary waiting for his fate.&nbsp; Never



<P>before had he felt so helpless.&nbsp; He had heard the report of the



<P>gun fired on board the launch, and he knew that his life was in



<P>untrustworthy hands, and that his enemies were very near.&nbsp; During



<P>the slow hours of the afternoon he roamed about on the edge of



<P>the forest, or, hiding in the bushes, watched the creek with



<P>unquiet eyes for some sign of danger.&nbsp; He feared not death, yet



<P>he desired ardently to live, for life to him was Nina.&nbsp; She had



<P>promised to come, to follow him, to share his danger and his



<P>splendour.&nbsp; But with her by his side he cared not for danger, and



<P>without her there could be no splendour and no joy in existence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Crouching in his shady hiding-place, he closed his eyes, trying



<P>to evoke the gracious and charming image of the white figure that



<P>for him was the beginning and the end of life.&nbsp; With eyes shut



<P>tight, his teeth hard set, he tried in a great effort of



<P>passionate will to keep his hold on that vision of supreme



<P>delight.&nbsp; In vain!&nbsp; His heart grew heavy as the figure of

Nina



<P>faded away to be replaced by another vision this time--a vision



<P>of armed men, of angry faces, of glittering arms--and he seemed



<P>to hear the hum of excited and triumphant voices as they



<P>discovered him in his hiding-place.&nbsp; Startled by the vividness

of



<P>his fancy, he would open his eyes, and, leaping out into the



<P>sunlight, resume his aimless wanderings around the clearing.&nbsp; As



<P>he skirted in his weary march the edge of the forest he glanced



<P>now and then into its dark shade, so enticing in its deceptive



<P>appearance of coolness, so repellent with its unrelieved gloom,



<P>where lay, entombed and rotting, countless generations of trees,



<P>and where their successors stood as if mourning, in dark green



<P>foliage, immense and helpless, awaiting their turn.&nbsp; Only the



<P>parasites seemed to live there in a sinuous rush upwards into the



<P>air and sunshine, feeding on the dead and the dying alike, and



<P>crowning their victims with pink and blue flowers that gleamed



<P>amongst the boughs, incongruous and cruel, like a strident and



<P>mocking note in the solemn harmony of the doomed trees.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A man could hide there, thought Dain, as he approached a place



<P>where the creepers had been torn and hacked into an archway that



<P>might have been the beginning of a path.&nbsp; As he bent down to look



<P>through he heard angry grunting, and a sounder of wild pig



<P>crashed away in the undergrowth.&nbsp; An acrid smell of damp earth



<P>and of decaying leaves took him by the throat, and he drew back



<P>with a scared face, as if he had been touched by the breath of



<P>Death itself.&nbsp; The very air seemed dead in there--heavy and



<P>stagnating, poisoned with the corruption of countless ages.&nbsp; He



<P>went on, staggering on his way, urged by the nervous restlessness



<P>that made him feel tired yet caused him to loathe the very idea



<P>of immobility and repose.&nbsp; Was he a wild man to hide in the woods



<P>and perhaps be killed there--in the darkness--where there was no



<P>room to breathe?&nbsp; He would wait for his enemies in the sunlight,



<P>where he could see the sky and feel the breeze.&nbsp; He knew how a



<P>Malay chief should die.&nbsp; The sombre and desperate fury, that



<P>peculiar inheritance of his race, took possession of him, and he



<P>glared savagely across the clearing towards the gap in the bushes



<P>by the riverside.&nbsp; They would come from there.&nbsp; In imagination

he



<P>saw them now.&nbsp; He saw the bearded faces and the white jackets of



<P>the officers, the light on the levelled barrels of the rifles.



<P>What is the bravery of the greatest warrior before the firearms



<P>in the hand of a slave?&nbsp; He would walk toward them with a smiling



<P>face, with his hands held out in a sign of submission till he was



<P>very near them.&nbsp; He would speak friendly words--come nearer



<P>yet--yet nearer--so near that they could touch him with their



<P>hands and stretch them out to make him a captive.&nbsp; That would be



<P>the time:&nbsp; with a shout and a leap he would be in the midst of



<P>them, kriss in hand, killing, killing, killing, and would die



<P>with the shouts of his enemies in his ears, their warm blood



<P>spurting before his eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Carried away by his excitement, he snatched the kriss hidden in



<P>his sarong, and, drawing a long breath, rushed forward, struck at



<P>the empty air, and fell on his face.&nbsp; He lay as if stunned in the



<P>sudden reaction from his exaltation, thinking that, even if he



<P>died thus gloriously, it would have to be before he saw Nina.



<P>Better so.&nbsp; If he saw her again he felt that death would be too



<P>terrible.&nbsp; With horror he, the descendant of Rajahs and of



<P>conquerors, had to face the doubt of his own bravery.&nbsp; His desire



<P>of life tormented him in a paroxysm of agonising remorse.&nbsp; He had



<P>not the courage to stir a limb.&nbsp; He had lost faith in himself,



<P>and there was nothing else in him of what makes a man.&nbsp; The



<P>suffering remained, for it is ordered that it should abide in the



<P>human body even to the last breath, and fear remained.&nbsp; Dimly he



<P>could look into the depths of his passionate love, see its



<P>strength and its weakness, and felt afraid.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sun went down slowly.&nbsp; The shadow of the western forest



<P>marched over the clearing, covered the man's scorched shoulders



<P>with its cool mantle, and went on hurriedly to mingle with the



<P>shadows of other forests on the eastern side.&nbsp; The sun lingered



<P>for a while amongst the light tracery of the higher branches, as



<P>if in friendly reluctance to abandon the body stretched in the



<P>green paddy-field.&nbsp; Then Dain, revived by the cool of the evening



<P>breeze, sat up and stared round him.&nbsp; As he did so the sun dipped



<P>sharply, as if ashamed of being detected in a sympathising



<P>attitude, and the clearing, which during the day was all light,



<P>became suddenly all darkness, where the fire gleamed like an eye.



<P>Dain walked slowly towards the creek, and, divesting himself of



<P>his torn sarong, his only garment, entered the water cautiously.



<P>He had had nothing to eat that day, and had not dared show



<P>himself in daylight by the water-side to drink.&nbsp; Now, as he swam



<P>silently, he swallowed a few mouthfuls of water that lapped about



<P>his lips.&nbsp; This did him good, and he walked with greater



<P>confidence in himself and others as he returned towards the fire.



<P>Had he been betrayed by Lakamba all would have been over by this.



<P>He made up a big blaze, and while it lasted dried himself, and



<P>then lay down by the embers.&nbsp; He could not sleep, but he felt a



<P>great numbness in all his limbs.&nbsp; His restlessness was gone, and



<P>he was content to lay still, measuring the time by watching the



<P>stars that rose in endless succession above the forests, while



<P>the slight puffs of wind under the cloudless sky seemed to fan



<P>their twinkle into a greater brightness.&nbsp; Dreamily he assured



<P>himself over and over again that she would come, till the



<P>certitude crept into his heart and filled him with a great peace.



<P>Yes, when the next day broke, they would be together on the great



<P>blue sea that was like life--away from the forests that were like



<P>death.&nbsp; He murmured the name of Nina into the silent space with

a



<P>tender smile: this seemed to break the spell of stillness, and



<P>far away by the creek a frog croaked loudly as if in answer.&nbsp; A



<P>chorus of loud roars and plaintive calls rose from the mud along



<P>the line of bushes.&nbsp; He laughed heartily; doubtless it was their



<P>love-song.&nbsp; He felt affectionate towards the frogs and listened,



<P>pleased with the noisy life near him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the moon peeped above the trees he felt the old impatience



<P>and the old restlessness steal over him.&nbsp; Why was she so late?



<P>True, it was a long way to come with a single paddle.&nbsp; With what



<P>skill and what endurance could those small hands manage a heavy



<P>paddle!&nbsp; It was very wonderful--such small hands, such soft



<P>little palms that knew how to touch his cheek with a feel lighter



<P>than the fanning of a butterfly's wing.&nbsp; Wonderful!&nbsp; He lost



<P>himself lovingly in the contemplation of this tremendous mystery,



<P>and when he looked at the moon again it had risen a hand's



<P>breadth above the trees.&nbsp; Would she come?&nbsp; He forced himself

to



<P>lay still, overcoming the impulse to rise and rush round the



<P>clearing again.&nbsp; He turned this way and that; at last, quivering



<P>with the effort, he lay on his back, and saw her face among the



<P>stars looking down on him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The croaking of frogs suddenly ceased.&nbsp; With the watchfulness of



<P>a hunted man Dain sat up, listening anxiously, and heard several



<P>splashes in the water as the frogs took rapid headers into the



<P>creek.&nbsp; He knew that they had been alarmed by something, and



<P>stood up suspicious and attentive.&nbsp; A slight grating noise, then



<P>the dry sound as of two pieces of wood struck against each other.



<P>Somebody was about to land!&nbsp; He took up an armful of brushwood,



<P>and, without taking his eyes from the path, held it over the



<P>embers of his fire.&nbsp; He waited, undecided, and saw something



<P>gleam amongst the bushes; then a white figure came out of the



<P>shadows and seemed to float towards him in the pale light.&nbsp; His



<P>heart gave a great leap and stood still, then went on shaking his



<P>frame in furious beats.&nbsp; He dropped the brushwood upon the



<P>glowing coals, and had an impression of shouting her name--of



<P>rushing to meet her; yet he emitted no sound, he stirred not an



<P>inch, but he stood silent and motionless like chiselled bronze



<P>under the moonlight that streamed over his naked shoulders.&nbsp; As



<P>he stood still, fighting with his breath, as if bereft of his



<P>senses by the intensity of his delight, she walked up to him with



<P>quick, resolute steps, and, with the appearance of one about to



<P>leap from a dangerous height, threw both her arms round his neck



<P>with a sudden gesture.&nbsp; A small blue gleam crept amongst the dry



<P>branches, and the crackling of reviving fire was the only sound



<P>as they faced each other in the speechless emotion of that



<P>meeting; then the dry fuel caught at once, and a bright hot flame



<P>shot upwards in a blaze as high as their heads, and in its light



<P>they saw each other's eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Neither of them spoke.&nbsp; He was regaining his senses in a slight



<P>tremor that ran upwards along his rigid body and hung about his



<P>trembling lips.&nbsp; She drew back her head and fastened her eyes on



<P>his in one of those long looks that are a woman's most terrible



<P>weapon; a look that is more stirring than the closest touch, and



<P>more dangerous than the thrust of a dagger, because it also whips



<P>the soul out of the body, but leaves the body alive and helpless,



<P>to be swayed here and there by the capricious tempests of passion



<P>and desire; a look that enwraps the whole body, and that



<P>penetrates into the innermost recesses of the being, bringing



<P>terrible defeat in the delirious uplifting of accomplished



<P>conquest.&nbsp; It has the same meaning for the man of the forests and



<P>the sea as for the man threading the paths of the more dangerous



<P>wilderness of houses and streets.&nbsp; Men that had felt in their



<P>breasts the awful exultation such a look awakens become mere



<P>things of to-day--which is paradise; forget yesterday--which was



<P>suffering; care not for to-morrow--which may be perdition.&nbsp; They



<P>wish to live under that look for ever.&nbsp; It is the look of woman's



<P>surrender.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He understood, and, as if suddenly released from his invisible



<P>bonds, fell at her feet with a shout of joy, and, embracing her



<P>knees, hid his head in the folds of her dress, murmuring



<P>disjointed words of gratitude and love.&nbsp; Never before had he felt



<P>so proud as now, when at the feet of that woman that half



<P>belonged to his enemies.&nbsp; Her fingers played with his hair in an



<P>absent-minded caress as she stood absorbed in thought.&nbsp; The thing



<P>was done.&nbsp; Her mother was right.&nbsp; The man was her slave.&nbsp;

As she



<P>glanced down at his kneeling form she felt a great pitying



<P>tenderness for that man she was used to call--even in her



<P>thoughts--the master of life.&nbsp; She lifted her eyes and looked



<P>sadly at the southern heavens under which lay the path of their



<P>lives--her own, and that man's at her feet.&nbsp; Did he not say



<P>himself is that she was the light of his life?&nbsp; She would be his



<P>light and his wisdom; she would be his greatness and his



<P>strength; yet hidden from the eyes of all men she would be, above



<P>all, his only and lasting weakness.&nbsp; A very woman!&nbsp; In the



<P>sublime vanity of her kind she was thinking already of moulding a



<P>god from the clay at her feet.&nbsp; A god for others to worship.&nbsp;

She



<P>was content to see him as he was now, and to feel him quiver at



<P>the slightest touch of her light fingers.&nbsp; And while her eyes



<P>looked sadly at the southern stars a faint smile seemed to be



<P>playing about her firm lips.&nbsp; Who can tell in the fitful light

of



<P>a camp fire?&nbsp; It might have been a smile of triumph, or of



<P>conscious power, or of tender pity, or, perhaps, of love.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She spoke softly to him, and he rose to his feet, putting his arm



<P>round her in quiet consciousness of his ownership; she laid her



<P>head on his shoulder with a sense of defiance to all the world in



<P>the encircling protection of that arm.&nbsp; He was hers with all his



<P>qualities and all his faults.&nbsp; His strength and his courage, his



<P>recklessness and his daring, his simple wisdom and his savage



<P>cunning--all were hers.&nbsp; As they passed together out of the red



<P>light of the fire into the silver shower of rays that fell upon



<P>the clearing he bent his head over her face, and she saw in his



<P>eyes the dreamy intoxication of boundless felicity from the close



<P>touch of her slight figure clasped to his side.&nbsp; With a



<P>rhythmical swing of their bodies they walked through the light



<P>towards the outlying shadows of the forests that seemed to guard



<P>their happiness in solemn immobility.&nbsp; Their forms melted in the



<P>play of light and shadow at the foot of the big trees, but the



<P>murmur of tender words lingered over the empty clearing, grew



<P>faint, and died out.&nbsp; A sigh as of immense sorrow passed over the



<P>land in the last effort of the dying breeze, and in the deep



<P>silence which succeeded, the earth and the heavens were suddenly



<P>hushed up in the mournful contemplation of human love and human



<P>blindness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They walked slowly back to the fire.&nbsp; He made for her a seat out



<P>of the dry branches, and, throwing himself down at her feet, lay



<P>his head in her lap and gave himself up to the dreamy delight of



<P>the passing hour.&nbsp; Their voices rose and fell, tender or animated



<P>as they spoke of their love and of their future.&nbsp; She, with a few



<P>skilful words spoken from time to time, guided his thoughts, and



<P>he let his happiness flow in a stream of talk passionate and



<P>tender, grave or menacing, according to the mood which she



<P>evoked.&nbsp; He spoke to her of his own island, where the gloomy



<P>forests and the muddy rivers were unknown.&nbsp; He spoke of its



<P>terraced fields, of the murmuring clear rills of sparkling water



<P>that flowed down the sides of great mountains, bringing life to



<P>the land and joy to its tillers.&nbsp; And he spoke also of the



<P>mountain peak that rising lonely above the belt of trees knew the



<P>secrets of the passing clouds, and was the dwelling-place of the



<P>mysterious spirit of his race, of the guardian genius of his



<P>house.&nbsp; He spoke of vast horizons swept by fierce winds that



<P>whistled high above the summits of burning mountains.&nbsp; He spoke



<P>of his forefathers that conquered ages ago the island of which he



<P>was to be the future ruler.&nbsp; And then as, in her interest, she



<P>brought her face nearer to his, he, touching lightly the thick



<P>tresses of her long hair, felt a sudden impulse to speak to her



<P>of the sea he loved so well; and he told her of its never-ceasing



<P>voice, to which he had listened as a child, wondering at its



<P>hidden meaning that no living man has penetrated yet; of its



<P>enchanting glitter; of its senseless and capricious fury; how its



<P>surface was for ever changing, and yet always enticing, while its



<P>depths were for ever the same, cold and cruel, and full of the



<P>wisdom of destroyed life.&nbsp; He told her how it held men slaves of



<P>its charm for a lifetime, and then, regardless of their devotion,



<P>swallowed them up, angry at their fear of its mystery, which it



<P>would never disclose, not even to those that loved it most.



<P>While he talked, Nina's head had been gradually sinking lower,



<P>and her face almost touched his now.&nbsp; Her hair was over his eyes,



<P>her breath was on his forehead, her arms were about his body.&nbsp;

No



<P>two beings could be closer to each other, yet she guessed rather



<P>than understood the meaning of his last words that came out after



<P>a slight hesitation in a faint murmur, dying out imperceptibly



<P>into a profound and significant silence:&nbsp; "The sea, O Nina, is



<P>like a woman's heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She closed his lips with a sudden kiss, and answered in a steady



<P>voice--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But to the men that have no fear, O master of my life, the sea



<P>is ever true."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Over their heads a film of dark, thread-like clouds, looking like



<P>immense cobwebs drifting under the stars, darkened the sky with



<P>the presage of the coming thunderstorm.&nbsp; From the invisible hills



<P>the first distant rumble of thunder came in a prolonged roll



<P>which, after tossing about from hill to hill, lost itself in the



<P>forests of the Pantai.&nbsp; Dain and Nina stood up, and the former



<P>looked at the sky uneasily.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is time for Babalatchi to be here," he said.&nbsp; "The night is



<P>more than half gone.&nbsp; Our road is long, and a bullet travels



<P>quicker than the best canoe."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He will be here before the moon is hidden behind the clouds,"



<P>said Nina.&nbsp; "I heard a splash in the water," she added.&nbsp; "Did

you



<P>hear it too?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Alligator," answered Dain shortly, with a careless glance



<P>towards the creek.&nbsp; "The darker the night," he continued, "the



<P>shorter will be our road, for then we could keep in the current



<P>of the main stream, but if it is light--even no more than now--we



<P>must follow the small channels of sleeping water, with nothing to



<P>help our paddles."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dain," interposed Nina, earnestly, "it was no alligator.&nbsp; I



<P>heard the bushes rustling near the landing-place."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Dain, after listening awhile.&nbsp; "It cannot be



<P>Babalatchi, who would come in a big war canoe, and openly.&nbsp; Those



<P>that are coming, whoever they are, do not wish to make much



<P>noise.&nbsp; But you have heard, and now I can see," he went on



<P>quickly.&nbsp; "It is but one man.&nbsp; Stand behind me, Nina.&nbsp;

If he is a



<P>friend he is welcome; if he is an enemy you shall see him die."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He laid his hand on his kriss, and awaited the approach of his



<P>unexpected visitor.&nbsp; The fire was burning very low, and small



<P>clouds--precursors of the storm--crossed the face of the moon in



<P>rapid succession, and their flying shadows darkened the clearing.



<P>He could not make out who the man might be, but he felt uneasy at



<P>the steady advance of the tall figure walking on the path with a



<P>heavy tread, and hailed it with a command to stop.&nbsp; The man



<P>stopped at some little distance, and Dain expected him to speak,



<P>but all he could hear was his deep breathing.&nbsp; Through a break

in



<P>the flying clouds a sudden and fleeting brightness descended upon



<P>the clearing.&nbsp; Before the darkness closed in again, Dain saw a



<P>hand holding some glittering object extended towards him, heard



<P>Nina's cry of "Father!" and in an instant the girl was between



<P>him and Almayer's revolver.&nbsp; Nina's loud cry woke up the echoes



<P>of the sleeping woods, and the three stood still as if waiting



<P>for the return of silence before they would give expression to



<P>their various feelings.&nbsp; At the appearance of Nina, Almayer's arm



<P>fell by his side, and he made a step forward.&nbsp; Dain pushed the



<P>girl gently aside.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Am I a wild beast that you should try to kill me suddenly and in



<P>the dark, Tuan Almayer?" said Dain, breaking the strained



<P>silence.&nbsp; "Throw some brushwood on the fire," he went on,



<P>speaking to Nina, "while I watch my white friend, lest harm



<P>should come to you or to me, O delight of my heart!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer ground his teeth and raised his arm again.&nbsp; With a quick



<P>bound Dain was at his side: there was a short scuffle, during



<P>which one chamber of the revolver went off harmlessly, then the



<P>weapon, wrenched out of Almayer's hand, whirled through the air



<P>and fell in the bushes.&nbsp; The two men stood close together,



<P>breathing hard.&nbsp; The replenished fire threw out an unsteady



<P>circle of light and shone on the terrified face of Nina, who



<P>looked at them with outstretched hands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dain!" she cried out warningly, "Dain!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He waved his hand towards her in a reassuring gesture, and,



<P>turning to Almayer, said with great courtesy--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now we may talk, Tuan.&nbsp; It is easy to send out death, but can



<P>your wisdom recall the life?&nbsp; She might have been harmed," he



<P>continued, indicating Nina.&nbsp; "Your hand shook much; for myself

I



<P>was not afraid."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nina!" exclaimed Almayer, "come to me at once.&nbsp; What is this



<P>sudden madness?&nbsp; What bewitched you?&nbsp; Come to your father,

and



<P>together we shall try to forget this horrible nightmare!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He opened his arms with the certitude of clasping her to his



<P>breast in another second.&nbsp; She did not move.&nbsp; As it dawned

upon



<P>him that she did not mean to obey he felt a deadly cold creep



<P>into his heart, and, pressing the palms of his hands to his



<P>temples, he looked down on the ground in mute despair.&nbsp; Dain took



<P>Nina by the arm and led her towards her father.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Speak to him in the language of his people," he said.&nbsp; "He is



<P>grieving--as who would not grieve at losing thee, my pearl!



<P>Speak to him the last words he shall hear spoken by that voice,



<P>which must be very sweet to him, but is all my life to me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He released her, and, stepping back a few paces out of the circle



<P>of light, stood in the darkness looking at them with calm



<P>interest.&nbsp; The reflection of a distant flash of lightning lit up



<P>the clouds over their heads, and was followed after a short



<P>interval by the faint rumble of thunder, which mingled with



<P>Almayer's voice as he began to speak.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you know what you are doing?&nbsp; Do you know what is waiting for



<P>you if you follow that man?&nbsp; Have you no pity for yourself?&nbsp;

Do



<P>you know that you shall be at first his plaything and then a



<P>scorned slave, a drudge, and a servant of some new fancy of that



<P>man?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She raised her hand to stop him, and turning her head slightly,



<P>asked--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You hear this Dain!&nbsp; Is it true?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By all the gods!" came the impassioned answer from the



<P>darkness-- "by heaven and earth, by my head and thine I swear:



<P>this is a white man's lie.&nbsp; I have delivered my soul into your



<P>hands for ever; I breathe with your breath, I see with your eyes,



<P>I think with your mind, and I take you into my heart for ever."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You thief!" shouted the exasperated Almayer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A deep silence succeeded this outburst, then the voice of Dain



<P>was heard again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nay, Tuan," he said in a gentle tone, "that is not true also.



<P>The girl came of her own will.&nbsp; I have done no more but to show



<P>her my love like a man; she heard the cry of my heart, and she



<P>came, and the dowry I have given to the woman you call your



<P>wife."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer groaned in his extremity of rage and shame.&nbsp; Nina laid



<P>her hand lightly on his shoulder, and the contact, light as the



<P>touch of a falling leaf, seemed to calm him.&nbsp; He spoke quickly,



<P>and in English this time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tell me," he said--"tell me, what have they done to you, your



<P>mother and that man?&nbsp; What made you give yourself up to that



<P>savage?&nbsp; For he is a savage.&nbsp; Between him and you there is

a



<P>barrier that nothing can remove.&nbsp; I can see in your eyes the look



<P>of those who commit suicide when they are mad.&nbsp; You are mad.



<P>Don't smile.&nbsp; It breaks my heart.&nbsp; If I were to see you drowning



<P>before my eyes, and I without the power to help you, I could not



<P>suffer a greater torment.&nbsp; Have you forgotten the teaching of so



<P>many years?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," she interrupted, "I remember it well.&nbsp; I remember how it



<P>ended also.&nbsp; Scorn for scorn, contempt for contempt, hate for



<P>hate.&nbsp; I am not of your race.&nbsp; Between your people and me

there



<P>is also a barrier that nothing can remove.&nbsp; You ask why I want

to



<P>go, and I ask you why I should stay."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He staggered as if struck in the face, but with a quick,



<P>unhesitating grasp she caught him by the arm and steadied him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why you should stay!" he repeated slowly, in a dazed manner, and



<P>stopped short, astounded at the completeness of his misfortune.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You told me yesterday," she went on again, "that I could not



<P>understand or see your love for me:&nbsp; it is so.&nbsp; How can I?&nbsp;

No



<P>two human beings understand each other.&nbsp; They can understand but



<P>their own voices.&nbsp; You wanted me to dream your dreams, to see



<P>your own visions--the visions of life amongst the white faces of



<P>those who cast me out from their midst in angry contempt.&nbsp; But



<P>while you spoke I listened to the voice of my own self; then this



<P>man came, and all was still; there was only the murmur of his



<P>love.&nbsp; You call him a savage!&nbsp; What do you call my mother,

your



<P>wife?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nina!" cried Almayer, "take your eyes off my face."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She looked down directly, but continued speaking only a little



<P>above a whisper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"In time," she went on, "both our voices, that man's and mine,



<P>spoke together in a sweetness that was intelligible to our ears



<P>only.&nbsp; You were speaking of gold then, but our ears were filled



<P>with the song of our love, and we did not hear you.&nbsp; Then I found



<P>that we could see through each other's eyes:&nbsp; that he saw things



<P>that nobody but myself and he could see.&nbsp; We entered a land where



<P>no one could follow us, and least of all you.&nbsp; Then I began to



<P>live."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She paused.&nbsp; Almayer sighed deeply.&nbsp; With her eyes still fixed

on



<P>the ground she began speaking again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I mean to live.&nbsp; I mean to follow him.&nbsp; I have been rejected



<P>with scorn by the white people, and now I am a Malay!&nbsp; He took

me



<P>in his arms, he laid his life at my feet.&nbsp; He is brave; he will



<P>be powerful, and I hold his bravery and his strength in my hand,



<P>and I shall make him great.&nbsp; His name shall be remembered long



<P>after both our bodies are laid in the dust.&nbsp; I love you no less



<P>than I did before, but I shall never leave him, for without him I



<P>cannot live."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If he understood what you have said," answered Almayer,



<P>scornfully, "he must be highly flattered.&nbsp; You want him as a tool



<P>for some incomprehensible ambition of yours.&nbsp; Enough, Nina.&nbsp;

If



<P>you do not go down at once to the creek, where Ali is waiting



<P>with my canoe, I shall tell him to return to the settlement and



<P>bring the Dutch officers here.&nbsp; You cannot escape from this



<P>clearing, for I have cast adrift your canoe.&nbsp; If the Dutch catch



<P>this hero of yours they will hang him as sure as I stand here.



<P>Now go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He made a step towards his daughter and laid hold of her by the



<P>shoulder, his other hand pointing down the path to the



<P>landing-place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Beware!" exclaimed Dain; "this woman belongs to me!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina wrenched herself free and looked straight at Almayer's angry



<P>face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I will not go," she said with desperate energy.&nbsp; "If he dies



<P>I shall die too!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You die!" said Almayer, contemptuously.&nbsp; "Oh, no!&nbsp; You shall



<P>live a life of lies and deception till some other vagabond comes



<P>along to sing; how did you say that?&nbsp; The song of love to you!



<P>Make up your mind quickly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He waited for a while, and then added meaningly--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shall I call out to Ali?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Call out," she answered in Malay, "you that cannot be true to



<P>your own countrymen.&nbsp; Only a few days ago you were selling the



<P>powder for their destruction; now you want to give up to them the



<P>man that yesterday you called your friend.&nbsp; Oh, Dain," she said,



<P>turning towards the motionless but attentive figure in the



<P>darkness, "instead of bringing you life I bring you death, for he



<P>will betray unless I leave you for ever!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dain came into the circle of light, and, throwing his arm around



<P>Nina's neck, whispered in her ear--"I can kill him where he



<P>stands, before a sound can pass his lips.&nbsp; For you it is to say



<P>yes or no.&nbsp; Babalatchi cannot be far now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He straightened himself up, taking his arm off her shoulder, and



<P>confronted Almayer, who looked at them both with an expression of



<P>concentrated fury,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No!" she cried, clinging to Dain in wild alarm.&nbsp; "No!&nbsp; Kill

me!



<P>Then perhaps he will let you go.&nbsp; You do not know the mind of a



<P>white man.&nbsp; He would rather see me dead than standing where I am.



<P>Forgive me, your slave, but you must not."&nbsp; She fell at his feet



<P>sobbing violently and repeating, "Kill me!&nbsp; Kill me!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I want you alive," said Almayer, speaking also in Malay, with



<P>sombre calmness.&nbsp; "You go, or he hangs.&nbsp; Will you obey?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dain shook Nina off, and, making a sudden lunge, struck Almayer



<P>full in the chest with the handle of his kriss, keeping the point



<P>towards himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hai, look! It was easy for me to turn the point the other way,"



<P>he said in his even voice.&nbsp; "Go, Tuan Putih," he added with



<P>dignity.&nbsp; "I give you your life, my life, and her life.&nbsp; I

am the



<P>slave of this woman's desire, and she wills it so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was not a glimmer of light in the sky now, and the tops of



<P>the trees were as invisible as their trunks, being lost in the



<P>mass of clouds that hung low over the woods, the clearing, and



<P>the river.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Every outline had disappeared in the intense blackness that



<P>seemed to have destroyed everything but space.&nbsp; Only the fire



<P>glimmered like a star forgotten in this annihilation of all



<P>visible things, and nothing was heard after Dain ceased speaking



<P>but the sobs of Nina, whom he held in his arms, kneeling beside



<P>the fire.&nbsp; Almayer stood looking down at them in gloomy



<P>thoughtfulness.&nbsp; As he was opening his lips to speak they were



<P>startled by a cry of warning by the riverside, followed by the



<P>splash of many paddles and the sound of voices.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Babalatchi!" shouted Dain, lifting up Nina as he got upon his



<P>feet quickly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ada!&nbsp; Ada!" came the answer from the panting statesman who ran



<P>up the path and stood amongst them.&nbsp; "Run to my canoe," he said



<P>to Dain excitedly, without taking any notice of Almayer.&nbsp; "Run!



<P>we must go.&nbsp; That woman has told them all!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What woman?" asked Dain, looking at Nina.&nbsp; Just then there was



<P>only one woman in the whole world for him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The she-dog with white teeth; the seven times accursed slave of



<P>Bulangi.&nbsp; She yelled at Abdulla's gate till she woke up all



<P>Sambir.&nbsp; Now the white officers are coming, guided by her and



<P>Reshid.&nbsp; If you want to live, do not look at me, but go!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How do you know this?" asked Almayer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Tuan! what matters how I know!&nbsp; I have only one eye, but I



<P>saw lights in Abdulla's house and in his campong as we were



<P>paddling past.&nbsp; I have ears, and while we lay under the bank I



<P>have heard the messengers sent out to the white men's house."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Will you depart without that woman who is my daughter?" said



<P>Almayer, addressing Dain, while Babalatchi stamped with



<P>impatience, muttering, "Run!&nbsp; Run at once!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," answered Dain, steadily, "I will not go; to no man will I



<P>abandon this woman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then kill me and escape yourself," sobbed out Nina.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He clasped her close, looking at her tenderly, and whispered, "We



<P>will never part, O Nina!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall not stay here any longer," broke in Babalatchi, angrily.



<P>"This is great foolishness.&nbsp; No woman is worth a man's life.&nbsp;

I



<P>am an old man, and I know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He picked up his staff, and, turning to go, looked at Dain as if



<P>offering him his last chance of escape.&nbsp; But Dain's face was



<P>hidden amongst Nina's black tresses, and he did not see this last



<P>appealing glance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Babalatchi vanished in the darkness.&nbsp; Shortly after his



<P>disappearance they heard the war canoe leave the landing-place in



<P>the swish of the numerous paddles dipped in the water together.



<P>Almost at the same time Ali came up from the riverside, two



<P>paddles on his shoulder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Our canoe is hidden up the creek, Tuan Almayer," he said, "in



<P>the dense bush where the forest comes down to the water.&nbsp; I took



<P>it there because I heard from Babalatchi's paddlers that the



<P>white men are coming here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Wait for me there," said Almayer, "but keep the canoe hidden."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He remained silent, listening to Ali's footsteps, then turned to



<P>Nina.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nina," he said sadly, "will you have no pity for me?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was no answer.&nbsp; She did not even turn her head, which was



<P>pressed close to Dain's breast.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He made a movement as if to leave them and stopped.&nbsp; By the dim



<P>glow of the burning-out fire he saw their two motionless figures.



<P>The woman's back turned to him with the long black hair streaming



<P>down over the white dress, and Dain's calm face looking at him



<P>above her head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot," he muttered to himself.&nbsp; After a long pause he spoke



<P>again a little lower, but in an unsteady voice, "It would be too



<P>great a disgrace.&nbsp; I am a white man."&nbsp; He broke down completely



<P>there, and went on tearfully, "I am a white man, and of good



<P>family.&nbsp; Very good family," he repeated, weeping bitterly.&nbsp;

"It



<P>would be a disgrace . . .&nbsp; all over the islands, . . . the only



<P>white man on the east coast.&nbsp; No, it cannot be . . . white men



<P>finding my daughter with this Malay.&nbsp; My daughter!" he cried



<P>aloud, with a ring of despair in his voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He recovered his composure after a while and said distinctly--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will never forgive you, Nina--never! If you were to come back



<P>to me now, the memory of this night would poison all my life.&nbsp;

I



<P>shall try to forget.&nbsp; I have no daughter.&nbsp; There used to be

a



<P>half-caste woman in my house, but she is going even now.&nbsp; You,



<P>Dain, or whatever your name may be, I shall take you and that



<P>woman to the island at the mouth of the river myself.&nbsp; Come with



<P>me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He led the way, following the bank as far as the forest.&nbsp; Ali



<P>answered to his call, and, pushing their way through the dense



<P>bush, they stepped into the canoe hidden under the overhanging



<P>branches.&nbsp; Dain laid Nina in the bottom, and sat holding her head



<P>on his knees.&nbsp; Almayer and Ali each took up a paddle.&nbsp; As

they



<P>were going to push out Ali hissed warningly.&nbsp; All listened.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the great stillness before the bursting out of the



<P>thunderstorm they could hear the sound of oars working regularly



<P>in their row-locks.&nbsp; The sound approached steadily, and Dain,



<P>looking through the branches, could see the faint shape of a big



<P>white boat.&nbsp; A woman's voice said in a cautious tone--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is the place where you may land white men; a little higher



<P>--there!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The boat was passing them so close in the narrow creek that the



<P>blades of the long oars nearly touched the canoe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Way enough! Stand by to jump on shore!&nbsp; He is alone and



<P>unarmed," was the quiet order in a man's voice, and in Dutch.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Somebody else whispered: "I think I can see a glimmer of a fire



<P>through the bush."&nbsp; And then the boat floated past them,



<P>disappearing instantly in the darkness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now," whispered Ali, eagerly, "let us push out and paddle away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The little canoe swung into the stream, and as it sprung forward



<P>in response to the vigorous dig of the paddles they could hear an



<P>angry shout.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He is not by the fire.&nbsp; Spread out, men, and search for him!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Blue lights blazed out in different parts of the clearing, and



<P>the shrill voice of a woman cried in accents of rage and pain--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Too late!&nbsp; O senseless white men!&nbsp; He has escaped!"

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>At last the excitement had died out in Sambir.&nbsp; The inhabitants



<P>got used to the sight of comings and goings between Almayer's



<P>house and the vessel, now moored to the opposite bank, and



<P>speculation as to the feverish activity displayed by Almayer's



<P>boatmen in repairing old canoes ceased to interfere with the due



<P>discharge of domestic duties by the women of the Settlement.



<P>Even the baffled Jim-Eng left off troubling his muddled brain



<P>with secrets of trade, and relapsed by the aid of his opium pipe



<P>into a state of stupefied bliss, letting Babalatchi pursue his



<P>way past his house uninvited and seemingly unnoticed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So on that warm afternoon, when the deserted river sparkled under



<P>the vertical sun, the statesman of Sambir could, without any



<P>hindrance from friendly inquirers, shove off his little canoe



<P>from under the bushes, where it was usually hidden during his



<P>visits to Almayer's compound.&nbsp; Slowly and languidly Babalatchi



<P>paddled, crouching low in the boat, making himself small under



<P>his as enormous sun hat to escape the scorching heat reflected



<P>from the water.&nbsp; He was not in a hurry; his master, Lakamba, was



<P>surely reposing at this time of the day.&nbsp; He would have ample



<P>time to cross over and greet him on his waking with important



<P>news.&nbsp; Will he be displeased?&nbsp; Will he strike his ebony wood



<P>staff angrily on the floor, frightening him by the incoherent



<P>violence of his exclamations; or will he squat down with a



<P>good-humoured smile, and, rubbing his hands gently over his



<P>stomach with a familiar gesture, expectorate copiously into the



<P>brass siri-vessel, giving vent to a low, approbative murmur?



<P>Such were Babalatchi's thoughts as he skilfully handled his



<P>paddle, crossing the river on his way to the Rajah's campong,



<P>whose stockades showed from behind the dense foliage of the bank



<P>just opposite to Almayer's bungalow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Indeed, he had a report to make.&nbsp; Something certain at last to



<P>confirm the daily tale of suspicions, the daily hints of



<P>familiarity, of stolen glances he had seen, of short and burning



<P>words he had overheard exchanged between Dain Maroola and



<P>Almayer's daughter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lakamba had, till then, listened to it all, calmly and with



<P>evident distrust; now he was going to be convinced, for



<P>Babalatchi had the proof; had it this very morning, when fishing



<P>at break of day in the creek over which stood Bulangi's house.



<P>There from his skiff he saw Nina's long canoe drift past, the



<P>girl sitting in the stern bending over Dain, who was stretched in



<P>the bottom with his head resting on the girl's knees.&nbsp; He saw it.



<P>He followed them, but in a short time they took to the paddles



<P>and got away from under his observant eye.&nbsp; A few minutes



<P>afterwards he saw Bulangi's slave-girl paddling in a small



<P>dug-out to the town with her cakes for sale.&nbsp; She also had seen



<P>them in the grey dawn.&nbsp; And Babalatchi grinned confidentially to



<P>himself at the recollection of the slave-girl's discomposed face,



<P>of the hard look in her eyes, of the tremble in her voice, when



<P>answering his questions.&nbsp; That little Taminah evidently admired



<P>Dain Maroola.&nbsp; That was good!&nbsp; And Babalatchi laughed aloud

at



<P>the notion; then becoming suddenly serious, he began by some



<P>strange association of ideas to speculate upon the price for



<P>which Bulangi would, possibly, sell the girl.&nbsp; He shook his head



<P>sadly at the thought that Bulangi was a hard man, and had refused



<P>one hundred dollars for that same Taminah only a few weeks ago;



<P>then he became suddenly aware that the canoe had drifted too far



<P>down during his meditation.&nbsp; He shook off the despondency caused



<P>by the certitude of Bulangi's mercenary disposition, and, taking



<P>up his paddle, in a few strokes sheered alongside the water-gate



<P>of the Rajah's house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That afternoon Almayer, as was his wont lately, moved about on



<P>the water-side, overlooking the repairs to his boats.&nbsp; He had



<P>decided at last.&nbsp; Guided by the scraps of information contained



<P>in old Lingard's pocket-book, he was going to seek for the rich



<P>gold-mine, for that place where he had only to stoop to gather up



<P>an immense fortune and realise the dream of his young days.&nbsp; To



<P>obtain the necessary help he had shared his knowledge with Dain



<P>Maroola, he had consented to be reconciled with Lakamba, who gave



<P>his support to the enterprise on condition of sharing the



<P>profits; he had sacrificed his pride, his honour, and his loyalty



<P>in the face of the enormous risk of his undertaking, dazzled by



<P>the greatness of the results to be achieved by this alliance so



<P>distasteful yet so necessary.&nbsp; The dangers were great, but



<P>Maroola was brave; his men seemed as reckless as their chief, and



<P>with Lakamba's aid success seemed assured.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the last fortnight Almayer was absorbed in the preparations,



<P>walking amongst his workmen and slaves in a kind of waking



<P>trance, where practical details as to the fitting out of the



<P>boats were mixed up with vivid dreams of untold wealth, where the



<P>present misery of burning sun, of the muddy and malodorous river



<P>bank disappeared in a gorgeous vision of a splendid future



<P>existence for himself and Nina.&nbsp;&nbsp; He hardly saw Nina during

these



<P>last days, although the beloved daughter was ever present in his



<P>thoughts.&nbsp; He hardly took notice of Dain, whose constant presence



<P>in his house had become a matter of course to him now they were



<P>connected by a community of interests.&nbsp;&nbsp; When meeting the

young



<P>chief he gave him an absent greeting and passed on, seemingly



<P>wishing to avoid him, bent upon forgetting the hated reality of



<P>the present by absorbing himself in his work, or else by letting



<P>his imagination soar far above the tree-tops into the great white



<P>clouds away to the westward, where the paradise of Europe was



<P>awaiting the future Eastern millionaire.&nbsp; And Maroola, now the



<P>bargain was struck and there was no more business to be talked



<P>over, evidently did not care for the white man's company.&nbsp; Yet



<P>Dain was always about the house, but he seldom stayed long by the



<P>riverside.&nbsp; On his daily visits to the white man the Malay chief



<P>preferred to make his way quietly through the central passage of



<P>the house, and would come out into the garden at the back, where



<P>the fire was burning in the cooking shed, with the rice kettle



<P>swinging over it, under the watchful supervision of Mrs. Almayer.



<P>Avoiding that shed, with its black smoke and the warbling of



<P>soft, feminine voices, Dain would turn to the left.&nbsp; There, on



<P>the edge of a banana plantation, a clump of palms and mango trees



<P>formed a shady spot, a few scattered bushes giving it a certain



<P>seclusion into which only the serving women's chatter or an



<P>occasional burst of laughter could penetrate.&nbsp; Once in, he was



<P>invisible; and hidden there, leaning against the smooth trunk of



<P>a tall palm, he waited with gleaming eyes and an assured smile to



<P>hear the faint rustle of dried grass under the light footsteps of



<P>Nina.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From the very first moment when his eyes beheld this--to him--



<P>perfection of loveliness he felt in his inmost heart the



<P>conviction that she would be his; he felt the subtle breath of



<P>mutual understanding passing between their two savage natures,



<P>and he did not want Mrs. Almayer's encouraging smiles to take



<P>every opportunity of approaching the girl; and every time he



<P>spoke to her, every time he looked into her eyes, Nina, although



<P>averting her face, felt as if this bold-looking being who spoke



<P>burning words into her willing ear was the embodiment of her



<P>fate, the creature of her dreams--reckless, ferocious, ready with



<P>flashing kriss for his enemies, and with passionate embrace for



<P>his beloved--the ideal Malay chief of her mother's tradition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She recognised with a thrill of delicious fear the mysterious



<P>consciousness of her identity with that being.&nbsp; Listening to his



<P>words, it seemed to her she was born only then to a knowledge of



<P>a new existence, that her life was complete only when near him,



<P>and she abandoned herself to a feeling of dreamy happiness, while



<P>with half- veiled face and in silence--as became a Malay



<P>girl--she listened to Dain's words giving up to her the whole



<P>treasure of love and passion his nature was capable of with all



<P>the unrestrained enthusiasm of a man totally untrammelled by any



<P>influence of civilised self-discipline.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And they used to pass many a delicious and fast fleeting hour



<P>under the mango trees behind the friendly curtain of bushes till



<P>Mrs. Almayer's shrill voice gave the signal of unwilling



<P>separation.&nbsp; Mrs. Almayer had undertaken the easy task of



<P>watching her husband lest he should interrupt the smooth course



<P>of her daughter's love affair, in which she took a great and



<P>benignant interest.&nbsp; She was happy and proud to see Dain's



<P>infatuation, believing him to be a great and powerful chief, and



<P>she found also a gratification of her mercenary instincts in



<P>Dain's open-handed generosity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the eve of the day when Babalatchi's suspicions were confirmed



<P>by ocular demonstration, Dain and Nina had remained longer than



<P>usual in their shady retreat.&nbsp; Only Almayer's heavy step on the



<P>verandah and his querulous clamour for food decided Mrs. Almayer



<P>to lift a warning cry.&nbsp; Maroola leaped lightly over the low



<P>bamboo fence, and made his way stealthily through the banana



<P>plantation down to the muddy shore of the back creek, while Nina



<P>walked slowly towards the house to minister to her father's



<P>wants, as was her wont every evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; Almayer felt happy

enough



<P>that evening; the preparations were nearly completed; to-morrow



<P>he would launch his boats.&nbsp; In his mind's eye he saw the rich



<P>prize in his grasp; and, with tin spoon in his hand, he was



<P>forgetting the plateful of rice before him in the fanciful



<P>arrangement of some splendid banquet to take place on his arrival



<P>in Amsterdam.&nbsp; Nina, reclining in the long chair, listened



<P>absently to the few disconnected words escaping from her father's



<P>lips.&nbsp; Expedition!&nbsp; Gold! What did she care for all that?&nbsp;

But at



<P>the name of Maroola mentioned by her father she was all



<P>attention.&nbsp; Dain was going down the river with his brig to-morrow



<P>to remain away for a few days, said Almayer.&nbsp; It was very



<P>annoying, this delay.&nbsp; As soon as Dain returned they would have



<P>to start without loss of time, for the river was rising.&nbsp; He



<P>would not be surprised if a great flood was coming.&nbsp; And he



<P>pushed away his plate with an impatient gesture on rising from



<P>the table.&nbsp; But now Nina heard him not.&nbsp; Dain going away!&nbsp;

That's



<P>why he had ordered her, with that quiet masterfulness it was her



<P>delight to obey, to meet him at break of day in Bulangi's creek.



<P>Was there a paddle in her canoe? she thought.&nbsp; Was it ready?&nbsp;

She



<P>would have to start early--at four in the morning, in a very few



<P>hours.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She rose from her chair, thinking she would require rest before



<P>the long pull in the early morning.&nbsp; The lamp was burning dimly,



<P>and her father, tired with the day's labour, was already in his



<P>hammock.&nbsp; Nina put the lamp out and passed into a large room she



<P>shared with her mother on the left of the central passage.



<P>Entering, she saw that Mrs. Almayer had deserted the pile of mats



<P>serving her as bed in one corner of the room, and was now bending



<P>over the opened lid of her large wooden chest.&nbsp; Half a shell of



<P>cocoanut filled with oil, where a cotton rag floated for a wick,



<P>stood on the floor, surrounding her with a ruddy halo of light



<P>shining through the black and odorous smoke.&nbsp; Mrs. Almayer's back



<P>was bent, and her head and shoulders hidden in the deep box.&nbsp; Her



<P>hands rummaged in the interior, where a soft clink as of silver



<P>money could be heard.&nbsp; She did not notice at first her daughter's



<P>approach, and Nina, standing silently by her, looked down on many



<P>little canvas bags ranged in the bottom of the chest, wherefrom



<P>her mother extracted handfuls of shining guilders and Mexican



<P>dollars, letting them stream slowly back again through her



<P>claw-like fingers.&nbsp; The music of tinkling silver seemed to



<P>delight her, and her eyes sparkled with the reflected gleam of



<P>freshly-minted coins.&nbsp; She was muttering to herself: "And this,



<P>and this, and yet this!&nbsp; Soon he will give more--as much more as



<P>I ask.&nbsp; He is a great Rajah--a Son of Heaven!&nbsp; And she will

be a



<P>Ranee--he gave all this for her!&nbsp; Who ever gave anything for me?



<P>I am a slave!&nbsp; Am I?&nbsp; I am the mother of a great Ranee!" She



<P>became aware suddenly of her daughter's presence, and ceased her



<P>droning, shutting the lid down violently; then, without rising



<P>from her crouching position, she looked up at the girl standing



<P>by with a vague smile on her dreamy face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have seen.&nbsp; Have you?" she shouted, shrilly.&nbsp; "That is

all



<P>mine, and for you.&nbsp; It is not enough!&nbsp; He will have to give

more



<P>before he takes you away to the southern island where his father



<P>is king.&nbsp; You hear me?&nbsp; You are worth more, granddaughter

of



<P>Rajahs!&nbsp; More!&nbsp; More!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sleepy voice of Almayer was heard on the verandah



<P>recommending silence.&nbsp; Mrs. Almayer extinguished the light and



<P>crept into her corner of the room.&nbsp; Nina laid down on her back

on



<P>a pile of soft mats, her hands entwined under her head, gazing



<P>through the shutterless hole, serving as a window at the stars



<P>twinkling on the black sky; she was awaiting the time of start



<P>for her appointed meeting-place.&nbsp; With quiet happiness she



<P>thought of that meeting in the great forest, far from all human



<P>eyes and sounds.&nbsp; Her soul, lapsing again into the savage mood,



<P>which the genius of civilisation working by the hand of Mrs.



<P>Vinck could never destroy, experienced a feeling of pride and of



<P>some slight trouble at the high value her worldly-wise mother had



<P>put upon her person; but she remembered the expressive glances



<P>and words of Dain, and, tranquillised, she closed her eyes in a



<P>shiver of pleasant anticipation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There are some situations where the barbarian and the, so-called,



<P>civilised man meet upon the same ground.&nbsp; It may be supposed that



<P>Dain Maroola was not exceptionally delighted with his prospective



<P>mother-in-law, nor that he actually approved of that worthy



<P>woman's appetite for shining dollars.&nbsp; Yet on that foggy morning



<P>when Babalatchi, laying aside the cares of state, went to visit



<P>his fish-baskets in the Bulangi creek, Maroola had no misgivings,



<P>experienced no feelings but those of impatience and longing, when



<P>paddling to the east side of the island forming the back-water in



<P>question.&nbsp; He hid his canoe in the bushes and strode rapidly



<P>across the islet, pushing with impatience through the twigs of



<P>heavy undergrowth intercrossed over his path.&nbsp; From motives of



<P>prudence he would not take his canoe to the meeting-place, as



<P>Nina had done.&nbsp; He had left it in the main stream till his return



<P>from the other side of the island.&nbsp; The heavy warm fog was



<P>closing rapidly round him, but he managed to catch a fleeting



<P>glimpse of a light away to the left, proceeding from Bulangi's



<P>house.&nbsp; Then he could see nothing in the thickening vapour, and



<P>kept to the path only by a sort of instinct, which also led him



<P>to the very point on the opposite shore he wished to reach.&nbsp; A



<P>great log had stranded there, at right angles to the bank,



<P>forming a kind of jetty against which the swiftly flowing stream



<P>broke with a loud ripple.&nbsp; He stepped on it with a quick but



<P>steady motion, and in two strides found himself at the outer end,



<P>with the rush and swirl of the foaming water at his feet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Standing there alone, as if separated from the world; the



<P>heavens, earth; the very water roaring under him swallowed up in



<P>the thick veil of the morning fog, he breathed out the name of



<P>Nina before him into the apparently limitless space, sure of



<P>being heard, instinctively sure of the nearness of the delightful



<P>creature; certain of her being aware of his near presence as he



<P>was aware of hers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The bow of Nina's canoe loomed up close to the log, canted high



<P>out of the water by the weight of the sitter in the stern.



<P>Maroola laid his hand on the stem and leaped lightly in, giving



<P>it a vigorous shove off.&nbsp; The light craft, obeying the new



<P>impulse, cleared the log by a hair's breadth, and the river, with



<P>obedient complicity, swung it broadside to the current, and bore



<P>it off silently and rapidly between the invisible banks.&nbsp; And



<P>once more Dain, at the feet of Nina, forgot the world, felt



<P>himself carried away helpless by a great wave of supreme emotion,



<P>by a rush of joy, pride, and desire; understood once more with



<P>overpowering certitude that there was no life possible without



<P>that being he held clasped in his arms with passionate strength



<P>in a prolonged embrace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina disengaged herself gently with a low laugh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will overturn the boat, Dain," she whispered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked into her eyes eagerly for a minute and let her go with



<P>a sigh, then lying down in the canoe he put his head on her



<P>knees, gazing upwards and stretching his arms backwards till his



<P>hands met round the girl's waist.&nbsp; She bent over him, and,



<P>shaking her head, framed both their faces in the falling locks of



<P>her long black hair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And so they drifted on, he speaking with all the rude eloquence



<P>of a savage nature giving itself up without restraint to an



<P>overmastering passion, she bending low to catch the murmur of



<P>words sweeter to her than life itself.&nbsp; To those two nothing



<P>existed then outside the gunwales of the narrow and fragile



<P>craft.&nbsp; It was their world, filled with their intense and



<P>all-absorbing love.&nbsp; They took no heed of thickening mist, or of



<P>the breeze dying away before sunrise; they forgot the existence



<P>of the great forests surrounding them, of all the tropical nature



<P>awaiting the advent of the sun in a solemn and impressive



<P>silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Over the low river-mist hiding the boat with its freight of young



<P>passionate life and all-forgetful happiness, the stars paled, and



<P>a silvery-grey tint crept over the sky from the eastward.&nbsp; There



<P>was not a breath of wind, not a rustle of stirring leaf, not a



<P>splash of leaping fish to disturb the serene repose of all living



<P>things on the banks of the great river.&nbsp; Earth, river, and sky



<P>were wrapped up in a deep sleep, from which it seemed there would



<P>be no waking.&nbsp; All the seething life and movement of tropical



<P>nature seemed concentrated in the ardent eyes, in the



<P>tumultuously beating hearts of the two beings drifting in the



<P>canoe, under the white canopy of mist, over the smooth surface of



<P>the river.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Suddenly a great sheaf of yellow rays shot upwards from behind



<P>the black curtain of trees lining the banks of the Pantai.&nbsp; The



<P>stars went out; the little black clouds at the zenith glowed for



<P>a moment with crimson tints, and the thick mist, stirred by the



<P>gentle breeze, the sigh of waking nature, whirled round and broke



<P>into fantastically torn pieces, disclosing the wrinkled surface



<P>of the river sparkling in the broad light of day.&nbsp; Great flocks



<P>of white birds wheeled screaming above the swaying tree-tops.



<P>The sun had risen on the east coast.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dain was the first to return to the cares of everyday life.&nbsp; He



<P>rose and glanced rapidly up and down the river.&nbsp; His eye detected



<P>Babalatchi's boat astern, and another small black speck on the



<P>glittering water, which was Taminah's canoe.&nbsp; He moved cautiously



<P>forward, and, kneeling, took up a paddle; Nina at the stern took



<P>hers.&nbsp; They bent their bodies to the work, throwing up the water



<P>at every stroke, and the small craft went swiftly ahead, leaving



<P>a narrow wake fringed with a lace-like border of white and



<P>gleaming foam.&nbsp; Without turning his head, Dain spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Somebody behind us, Nina.&nbsp; We must not let him gain.&nbsp; I think

he



<P>is too far to recognise us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Somebody before us also," panted out Nina, without ceasing to



<P>paddle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think I know," rejoined Dain.&nbsp; "The sun shines over there, but



<P>I fancy it is the girl Taminah.&nbsp; She comes down every morning to



<P>my brig to sell cakes--stays often all day.&nbsp; It does not matter;



<P>steer more into the bank; we must get under the bushes.&nbsp; My canoe



<P>is hidden not far from here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he spoke his eyes watched the broad-leaved nipas which they



<P>were brushing in their swift and silent course.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Look out, Nina," he said at last; "there, where the water palms



<P>end and the twigs hang down under the leaning tree.&nbsp; Steer for



<P>the big green branch."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He stood up attentive, and the boat drifted slowly in shore, Nina



<P>guiding it by a gentle and skilful movement of her paddle.&nbsp; When



<P>near enough Dain laid hold of the big branch, and leaning back



<P>shot the canoe under a low green archway of thickly matted



<P>creepers giving access to a miniature bay formed by the caving in



<P>of the bank during the last great flood.&nbsp; His own boat was there



<P>anchored by a stone, and he stepped into it, keeping his hand on



<P>the gunwale of Nina's canoe.&nbsp; In a moment the two little



<P>nutshells with their occupants floated quietly side by side,



<P>reflected by the black water in the dim light struggling through



<P>a high canopy of dense foliage; while above, away up in the broad



<P>day, flamed immense red blossoms sending down on their heads a



<P>shower of great dew-sparkling petals that descended rotating



<P>slowly in a continuous and perfumed stream; and over them, under



<P>them, in the sleeping water; all around them in a ring of



<P>luxuriant vegetation bathed in the warm air charged with strong



<P>and harsh perfumes, the intense work of tropical nature went on:



<P>plants shooting upward, entwined, interlaced in inextricable



<P>confusion, climbing madly and brutally over each other in the



<P>terrible silence of a desperate struggle towards the life-giving



<P>sunshine above--as if struck with sudden horror at the seething



<P>mass of corruption below, at the death and decay from which they



<P>sprang.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We must part now," said Dain, after a long silence.&nbsp; "You must



<P>return at once, Nina.&nbsp; I will wait till the brig drifts down



<P>here, and shall get on board then."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And will you be long away, Dain?" asked Nina, in a low voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Long!" exclaimed Dain.&nbsp; "Would a man willingly remain long in

a



<P>dark place?&nbsp; When I am not near you, Nina, I am like a man that



<P>is blind.&nbsp; What is life to me without light?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina leaned over, and with a proud and happy smile took Dain's



<P>face between her hands, looking into his eyes with a fond yet



<P>questioning gaze.&nbsp; Apparently she found there the confirmation

of



<P>the words just said, for a feeling of grateful security lightened



<P>for her the weight of sorrow at the hour of parting.&nbsp; She



<P>believed that he, the descendant of many great Rajahs, the son of



<P>a great chief, the master of life and death, knew the sunshine of



<P>life only in her presence.&nbsp; An immense wave of gratitude and love



<P>welled forth out of her heart towards him.&nbsp; How could she make

an



<P>outward and visible sign of all she felt for the man who had



<P>filled her heart with so much joy and so much pride?&nbsp; And in the



<P>great tumult of passion, like a flash of lightning came to her



<P>the reminiscence of that despised and almost forgotten



<P>civilisation she had only glanced at in her days of restraint, of



<P>sorrow, and of anger.&nbsp; In the cold ashes of that hateful and



<P>miserable past she would find the sign of love, the fitting



<P>expression of the boundless felicity of the present, the pledge



<P>of a bright and splendid future.&nbsp; She threw her arms around



<P>Dain's neck and pressed her lips to his in a long and burning



<P>kiss.&nbsp; He closed his eyes, surprised and frightened at the storm



<P>raised in his breast by the strange and to him hitherto unknown



<P>contact, and long after Nina had pushed her canoe into the river



<P>he remained motionless, without daring to open his eyes, afraid



<P>to lose the sensation of intoxicating delight he had tasted for



<P>the first time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now he wanted but immortality, he thought, to be the equal of



<P>gods, and the creature that could open so the gates of paradise



<P>must be his--soon would be his for ever!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He opened his eyes in time to see through the archway of creepers



<P>the bows of his brig come slowly into view, as the vessel drifted



<P>past on its way down the river.&nbsp; He must go on board now, he



<P>thought; yet he was loth to leave the place where he had learned



<P>to know what happiness meant.&nbsp; "Time yet.&nbsp; Let them go," he



<P>muttered to himself; and he closed his eyes again under the red



<P>shower of scented petals, trying to recall the scene with all its



<P>delight and all its fear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He must have been able to join his brig in time, after all, and



<P>found much occupation outside, for it was in vain that Almayer



<P>looked for his friend's speedy return.&nbsp; The lower reach of the



<P>river where he so often and so impatiently directed his eyes



<P>remained deserted, save for the rapid flitting of some fishing



<P>canoe; but down the upper reaches came black clouds and heavy



<P>showers heralding the final setting in of the rainy season with



<P>its thunderstorms and great floods making the river almost



<P>impossible of ascent for native canoes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer, strolling along the muddy beach between his houses,



<P>watched uneasily the river rising inch by inch, creeping slowly



<P>nearer to the boats, now ready and hauled up in a row under the



<P>cover of dripping Kajang-mats.&nbsp; Fortune seemed to elude his



<P>grasp, and in his weary tramp backwards and forwards under the



<P>steady rain falling from the lowering sky, a sort of despairing



<P>indifference took possession of him.&nbsp; What did it matter?&nbsp;

It was



<P>just his luck!&nbsp; Those two infernal savages, Lakamba and Dain,



<P>induced him, with their promises of help, to spend his last



<P>dollar in the fitting out of boats, and now one of them was gone



<P>somewhere, and the other shut up in his stockade would give no



<P>sign of life.&nbsp; No, not even the scoundrelly Babalatchi, thought



<P>Almayer, would show his face near him, now they had sold him all



<P>the rice, brass gongs, and cloth necessary for his expedition.



<P>They had his very last coin, and did not care whether he went or



<P>stayed.&nbsp; And with a gesture of abandoned discouragement Almayer



<P>would climb up slowly to the verandah of his new house to get out



<P>of the rain, and leaning on the front rail with his head sunk



<P>between his shoulders he would abandon himself to the current of



<P>bitter thoughts, oblivious of the flight of time and the pangs of



<P>hunger, deaf to the shrill cries of his wife calling him to the



<P>evening meal.&nbsp; When, roused from his sad meditations by the first



<P>roll of the evening thunderstorm, he stumbled slowly towards the



<P>glimmering light of his old house, his half-dead hope made his



<P>ears preternaturally acute to any sound on the river.&nbsp; Several



<P>nights in succession he had heard the splash of paddles and had



<P>seen the indistinct form of a boat, but when hailing the shadowy



<P>apparition, his heart bounding with sudden hope of hearing Dain's



<P>voice, he was disappointed each time by the sulky answer



<P>conveying to him the intelligence that the Arabs were on the



<P>river, bound on a visit to the home-staying Lakamba.&nbsp; This caused



<P>him many sleepless nights, spent in speculating upon the kind of



<P>villainy those estimable personages were hatching now.&nbsp; At last,



<P>when all hope seemed dead, he was overjoyed on hearing Dain's



<P>voice; but Dain also appeared very anxious to see Lakamba, and



<P>Almayer felt uneasy owing to a deep and ineradicable distrust as



<P>to that ruler's disposition towards himself.&nbsp; Still, Dain had



<P>returned at last.&nbsp; Evidently he meant to keep to his bargain.



<P>Hope revived, and that night Almayer slept soundly, while Nina



<P>watched the angry river under the lash of the thunderstorm



<P>sweeping onward towards the sea.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Kaspar! Makan!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The well-known shrill voice startled Almayer from his dream of



<P>splendid future into the unpleasant realities of the present



<P>hour.&nbsp; An unpleasant voice too.&nbsp; He had heard it for many

years,



<P>and with every year he liked it less.&nbsp; No matter; there would be



<P>an end to all this soon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He shuffled uneasily, but took no further notice of the call.



<P>Leaning with both his elbows on the balustrade of the verandah,



<P>he went on looking fixedly at the great river that flowed--



<P>indifferent and hurried--before his eyes.&nbsp; He liked to look at

it



<P>about the time of sunset; perhaps because at that time the



<P>sinking sun would spread a glowing gold tinge on the waters of



<P>the Pantai, and Almayer's thoughts were often busy with gold;



<P>gold he had failed to secure; gold the others had secured--



<P>dishonestly, of course--or gold he meant to secure yet, through



<P>his own honest exertions, for himself and Nina.&nbsp; He absorbed



<P>himself in his dream of wealth and power away from this&nbsp; coast



<P>where he had dwelt for so many years, forgetting the bitterness



<P>of toil and strife in the vision of a great and splendid reward.



<P>They would live in Europe, he and his daughter.&nbsp; They would be



<P>rich and respected.&nbsp; Nobody would think of her mixed blood in the



<P>presence of her great beauty and of his immense wealth.



<P>Witnessing her triumphs he would grow young again, he would



<P>forget the twenty-five years of heart-breaking struggle on this



<P>coast where he felt like a prisoner.&nbsp; All this was nearly within



<P>his reach.&nbsp; Let only Dain return!&nbsp; And return soon he must--in



<P>his own interest, for his own share.&nbsp; He was&nbsp; now more than

a



<P>week late!&nbsp; Perhaps he would return to-night. Such were Almayer's



<P>thoughts as, standing on the verandah of his new but already



<P>decaying house--that last failure of his life-- he looked on the



<P>broad river.&nbsp; There was no tinge of gold on it this evening, for



<P>it had been swollen by the rains, and rolled an angry and muddy



<P>flood under his inattentive eyes, carrying small drift-wood and



<P>big dead logs, and whole uprooted trees with branches and



<P>foliage, amongst which the water swirled and roared angrily.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One of those drifting trees grounded on the shelving shore, just



<P>by the house, and Almayer, neglecting his dream, watched it with



<P>languid interest.&nbsp; The tree swung slowly round, amid the hiss and



<P>foam of the water, and soon getting free of the obstruction began



<P>to move down stream again, rolling slowly over, raising upwards a



<P>long, denuded branch, like a hand lifted in mute appeal to heaven



<P>against the river's brutal and unnecessary violence.&nbsp; Almayer's



<P>interest in the fate of that tree increased rapidly.&nbsp; He leaned



<P>over to see if it would clear the low point below.&nbsp; It did; then



<P>he drew back, thinking that now its course was free down to the



<P>sea, and he envied the lot of that inanimate thing now growing



<P>small and indistinct in the deepening darkness.&nbsp; As he lost sight



<P>of it altogether he began to wonder how far out to sea it would



<P>drift.&nbsp; Would the current carry it north or south?&nbsp; South,



<P>probably, till it drifted in sight of Celebes, as far as



<P>Macassar, perhaps!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Macassar!&nbsp; Almayer's quickened fancy distanced the tree on its



<P>imaginary voyage, but his memory lagging behind some twenty years



<P>or more in point of time saw a young and slim Almayer, clad all



<P>in white and modest-looking, landing from the Dutch mail-boat on



<P>the dusty jetty of Macassar, coming to woo fortune in the godowns



<P>of old Hudig.&nbsp; It was an important epoch in his life, the



<P>beginning of a new existence for him.&nbsp; His father, a subordinate



<P>official employed in the Botanical Gardens of Buitenzorg, was no



<P>doubt delighted to place his son in such a firm.&nbsp; The young man



<P>himself too was nothing loth to leave the poisonous shores of



<P>Java, and the meagre comforts of the parental bungalow, where the



<P>father grumbled all day at the stupidity of native gardeners, and



<P>the mother from the depths of her long easy-chair bewailed the



<P>lost glories of Amsterdam, where she had been brought up, and of



<P>her position as the daughter of a cigar dealer there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer had left his home with a light heart and a lighter



<P>pocket, speaking English well, and strong in arithmetic; ready to



<P>conquer the world, never doubting that he would.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After those twenty years, standing in the close and stifling heat



<P>of a Bornean evening, he recalled with pleasurable regret the



<P>image of Hudig's lofty and cool warehouses with their long and



<P>straight avenues of gin cases and bales of Manchester goods; the



<P>big door swinging noiselessly; the dim light of the place, so



<P>delightful after the glare of the streets; the little railed-off



<P>spaces amongst piles of merchandise where the Chinese clerks,



<P>neat, cool, and sad-eyed, wrote rapidly and in silence amidst the



<P>din of the working gangs rolling casks or shifting cases to a



<P>muttered song, ending with a desperate yell.&nbsp; At the upper end,



<P>facing the great door, there was a larger space railed off, well



<P>lighted; there the noise was subdued by distance, and above it



<P>rose the soft and continuous clink of silver guilders which other



<P>discreet Chinamen were counting and piling up under the



<P>supervision of Mr. Vinck, the cashier, the genius presiding&nbsp; in



<P>the place--the right hand of the Master.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In that clear space Almayer worked at his table not far from a



<P>little green painted door, by which always stood a Malay in a red



<P>sash and turban, and whose hand, holding a small string dangling



<P>from above, moved up and down with the regularity of a machine.



<P>The string worked a punkah on the other side of the green door,



<P>where the so-called private office was, and where old Hudig--the



<P>Master--sat enthroned, holding noisy receptions.&nbsp; Sometimes the



<P>little door would fly open disclosing to the outer world, through



<P>the bluish haze of tobacco smoke, a long table loaded with



<P>bottles of various shapes and tall water-pitchers, rattan



<P>easy-chairs occupied by noisy men in sprawling attitudes, while



<P>the Master would put his head through and, holding by the handle,



<P>would grunt confidentially to Vinck; perhaps send an order



<P>thundering down the warehouse, or spy a hesitating stranger and



<P>greet him with a friendly roar, "Welgome, Gapitan! ver' you gome



<P>vrom?&nbsp; Bali, eh?&nbsp; Got bonies?&nbsp; I vant bonies!&nbsp; Vant

all you got;



<P>ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; Gome in!"&nbsp; Then the stranger was dragged in,

in a



<P>tempest of yells, the door was shut, and the usual noises



<P>refilled the place; the song of the workmen, the rumble of



<P>barrels, the scratch of rapid pens; while above all rose the



<P>musical chink of broad silver pieces streaming ceaselessly



<P>through the yellow fingers of the attentive Chinamen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At that time Macassar was teeming with life and commerce.&nbsp; It was



<P>the point in the islands where tended all those bold spirits who,



<P>fitting out schooners on the Australian coast, invaded the Malay



<P>Archipelago in search of money and adventure.&nbsp; Bold, reckless,



<P>keen in business, not disinclined for a brush with the pirates



<P>that were to be found on many a coast as yet, making money fast,



<P>they used to have a general "rendezvous" in the bay for purposes



<P>of trade and dissipation.&nbsp; The Dutch merchants called those men



<P>English pedlars; some of them were undoubtedly gentlemen for whom



<P>that kind of life had a charm; most were seamen; the acknowledged



<P>king of them all was Tom Lingard, he whom the Malays, honest or



<P>dishonest, quiet fishermen or desperate cut-throats, recognised



<P>as "the Rajah-Laut"--the King of the Sea.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer had heard of him before he had been three days in



<P>Macassar, had heard the stories of his smart business



<P>transactions, his loves, and also of his desperate fights with



<P>the Sulu pirates, together with the romantic tale of some child--



<P>a girl--found in a piratical prau by the victorious Lingard,



<P>when, after a long contest, he boarded the craft, driving the



<P>crew overboard.&nbsp; This girl, it was generally known, Lingard had



<P>adopted, was having her educated in some convent in Java,&nbsp; and



<P>spoke of her as "my daughter."&nbsp; He had sworn a mighty oath to



<P>marry her to a white man before he went home and to leave her all



<P>his money.&nbsp; "And Captain Lingard has lots of money," would say



<P>Mr. Vinck solemnly, with his head on one side, "lots of money;



<P>more than Hudig!"&nbsp; And after a pause--just to let his hearers



<P>recover from their astonishment at such an incredible assertion--



<P>he would add in an explanatory whisper, "You know, he has



<P>discovered a river."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That was it!&nbsp; He had discovered a river!&nbsp; That was the fact



<P>placing old Lingard so much above the common crowd of sea-going



<P>adventurers who traded with Hudig in the daytime and drank



<P>champagne, gambled, sang noisy songs, and made love to half-caste



<P>girls under the broad verandah of the Sunda Hotel at night.&nbsp; Into



<P>that river, whose entrances himself only knew, Lingard used to



<P>take his assorted cargo of Manchester goods, brass gongs, rifles



<P>and gunpowder.&nbsp; His brig Flash, which he commanded himself, would



<P>on those occasions disappear quietly during the night from the



<P>roadstead while his companions were sleeping off the effects of



<P>the midnight carouse, Lingard seeing them drunk under the table



<P>before going on board, himself unaffected by any amount of



<P>liquor.&nbsp; Many tried to follow him and find that land of plenty



<P>for gutta-percha and rattans, pearl shells and birds' nests,&nbsp; wax



<P>and gum-dammar, but the little Flash could outsail every craft in



<P>those seas.&nbsp; A few of them came to grief on hidden sandbanks and



<P>coral reefs, losing their all and barely escaping with life from



<P>the cruel grip of this sunny and smiling sea; others got



<P>discouraged; and for many years the green and peaceful-looking



<P>islands guarding the entrances to the promised land kept their



<P>secret with all the merciless serenity of tropical nature.&nbsp; And



<P>so Lingard came and went on his secret or open expeditions,



<P>becoming a hero in Almayer's eyes by the boldness and enormous



<P>profits of his ventures, seeming to&nbsp; Almayer a very great man



<P>indeed as he saw him marching up the&nbsp; warehouse, grunting a "how



<P>are you?" to Vinck, or greeting Hudig, the Master, with a



<P>boisterous "Hallo, old pirate!&nbsp; Alive yet?" as a preliminary to



<P>transacting business behind the little green door.&nbsp; Often of an



<P>evening, in the silence of the then deserted warehouse, Almayer



<P>putting away his papers before driving home with Mr. Vinck, in



<P>whose household he lived, would pause listening to the noise of a



<P>hot discussion in the private office, would hear the deep and



<P>monotonous growl of the Master, and the roared-out interruptions



<P>of Lingard--two mastiffs fighting over a marrowy bone.&nbsp; But to



<P>Almayer's ears it sounded like a quarrel of Titans--a battle of



<P>the gods.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a year or so Lingard, having been brought often in contact



<P>with Almayer in the course of business, took a sudden and, to the



<P>onlookers, a rather inexplicable fancy to the young man.&nbsp; He sang



<P>his praises, late at night, over a convivial glass to his cronies



<P>in the Sunda Hotel, and one fine morning electrified Vinck by



<P>declaring that he must have "that young fellow for a supercargo.



<P>Kind of captain's clerk.&nbsp; Do all my quill-driving for me."&nbsp;

Hudig



<P>consented.&nbsp; Almayer, with youth's natural craving for change, was



<P>nothing loth, and packing his few belongings, started in the



<P>Flash on one of those long cruises when the old seaman was wont



<P>to visit almost every island in the archipelago.&nbsp; Months slipped



<P>by, and Lingard's friendship seemed to increase.&nbsp; Often pacing



<P>the deck with Almayer, when the faint night breeze, heavy with



<P>aromatic exhalations of the islands, shoved the brig gently along



<P>under the peaceful and sparkling sky, did the old seaman open his



<P>heart to his entranced listener.&nbsp; He spoke of his past life, of



<P>escaped dangers, of big profits in his trade, of new combinations



<P>that were in the future to bring profits bigger still.&nbsp; Often he



<P>had mentioned his daughter, the girl found in the pirate prau,



<P>speaking of her with a strange assumption of fatherly tenderness.



<P>"She must be a big girl now," he used to say.&nbsp; "It's nigh unto



<P>four years since I have seen her!&nbsp; Damme, Almayer, if I don't



<P>think we will run into Sourabaya this trip."&nbsp; And after such a



<P>declaration he always dived into his cabin muttering to himself,



<P>"Something must be done--must be done."&nbsp; More than once he would



<P>astonish Almayer by walking up to him rapidly, clearing his



<P>throat with a powerful "Hem!" as if he was going to say



<P>something, and then turning abruptly away to lean over the



<P>bulwarks in silence, and watch, motionless, for hours, the gleam



<P>and sparkle of the phosphorescent sea along the ship's side.&nbsp; It



<P>was the night before arriving in Sourabaya when one of those



<P>attempts at confidential communication succeeded.&nbsp; After clearing



<P>his throat he spoke.&nbsp; He spoke to some purpose.&nbsp; He wanted



<P>Almayer to marry his adopted daughter.&nbsp; "And don't you kick



<P>because you're white!" he shouted, suddenly, not giving the



<P>surprised young man the time to say a word.&nbsp; "None of that with



<P>me!&nbsp; Nobody will see the colour of your wife's skin.&nbsp; The

dollars



<P>are too thick for that, I tell you!&nbsp; And mind you, they will be



<P>thicker yet before I die.&nbsp; There will be millions, Kaspar!



<P>Millions I say!&nbsp; And all for her--and for you, if you do what you



<P>are told."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Startled by the unexpected proposal, Almayer hesitated, and



<P>remained silent for a minute.&nbsp; He was gifted with a strong and



<P>active imagination, and in that short space of time he saw, as in



<P>a flash of dazzling light, great piles of shining guilders, and



<P>realised all the possibilities of an opulent existence.&nbsp; The



<P>consideration, the indolent ease of life--for which he felt



<P>himself so well fitted--his ships, his warehouses, his



<P>merchandise (old Lingard would not live for ever), and, crowning



<P>all, in the far future gleamed like a fairy palace the big



<P>mansion in Amsterdam, that earthly paradise of his dreams, where,



<P>made king amongst men by old Lingard's money, he would pass the



<P>evening of his days in inexpressible splendour.&nbsp; As to the&nbsp;

other



<P>side of the picture--the companionship for life of a Malay girl,



<P>that legacy of a boatful of pirates--there was only within him a



<P>confused consciousness of shame that he a white man-- Still, a



<P>convent education of four years!--and then she may mercifully



<P>die.&nbsp; He was always lucky, and money is powerful!&nbsp; Go through

it.



<P>Why not?&nbsp; He had a vague idea of shutting her up somewhere,



<P>anywhere, out of his gorgeous future.&nbsp; Easy enough to dispose of



<P>a Malay woman, a slave, after all, to his Eastern mind, convent



<P>or no convent, ceremony or no ceremony.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He lifted his head and confronted the anxious yet irate seaman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I--of course--anything you wish, Captain Lingard."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Call me father, my boy.&nbsp; She does," said the mollified old



<P>adventurer.&nbsp; "Damme, though, if I didn't think you were going to



<P>refuse.&nbsp; Mind you, Kaspar, I always get my way, so it would have



<P>been no use.&nbsp; But you are no fool."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He remembered well that time--the look, the accent, the words,



<P>the effect they produced on him, his very surroundings.&nbsp; He



<P>remembered the narrow slanting deck of the brig, the silent



<P>sleeping coast, the smooth black surface of the sea with a great



<P>bar of gold laid on it by the rising moon.&nbsp; He remembered it all,



<P>and he remembered his feelings of mad exultation at the thought



<P>of that fortune thrown into his hands.&nbsp; He was no fool then, and



<P>he was no fool now.&nbsp; Circumstances had been against him; the



<P>fortune was gone, but hope remained.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He shivered in the night air, and suddenly became aware of the



<P>intense darkness which, on the sun's departure, had closed in



<P>upon the river, blotting out the outlines of the opposite shore.



<P>Only the fire of dry branches lit outside the stockade of the



<P>Rajah's compound called fitfully into view the ragged trunks of



<P>the surrounding trees, putting a stain of glowing red half-way



<P>across the river where the drifting logs were hurrying towards



<P>the sea through the impenetrable gloom.&nbsp; He had a hazy



<P>recollection of having been called some time during the&nbsp; evening



<P>by his wife.&nbsp; To his dinner probably.&nbsp; But a man busy



<P>contemplating the wreckage of his past in the dawn of new hopes



<P>cannot be hungry whenever his rice is ready.&nbsp; Time he went home,



<P>though; it was getting late.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He stepped cautiously on the loose planks towards the ladder.&nbsp;

A



<P>lizard, disturbed by the noise, emitted a plaintive note and



<P>scurried through the long grass growing on the bank.&nbsp; Almayer



<P>descended the ladder carefully, now thoroughly recalled to the



<P>realities of life by the care necessary to prevent a fall on the



<P>uneven ground where the stones, decaying planks, and half-sawn



<P>beams were piled up in inextricable confusion.&nbsp; As he turned



<P>towards the house where he lived--"my old house" he called it--



<P>his ear detected the splash of paddles away in the darkness of



<P>the river.&nbsp; He stood still in the path, attentive and surprised



<P>at anybody being on the river at this late hour during such a



<P>heavy freshet.&nbsp; Now he could hear the paddles distinctly, and



<P>even a rapidly exchanged word in low tones, the heavy breathing



<P>of men fighting with the current, and hugging the bank on which



<P>he stood.&nbsp; Quite close, too, but it was too dark to distinguish



<P>anything under the overhanging bushes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Arabs, no doubt," muttered Almayer to himself, peering into the



<P>solid blackness.&nbsp; "What are they up to now?&nbsp; Some of Abdulla's



<P>business; curse him!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The boat was very close now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, ya!&nbsp; Man!" hailed Almayer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sound of voices ceased, but the paddles worked as furiously



<P>as before.&nbsp; Then the bush in front of Almayer shook, and the



<P>sharp sound of the paddles falling into the canoe rang in the



<P>quiet night.&nbsp; They were holding on to the bush now; but Almayer



<P>could hardly make out an indistinct dark shape of a man's head



<P>and shoulders above the bank.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You Abdulla?" said Almayer, doubtfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A grave voice answered--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tuan Almayer is speaking to a friend.&nbsp; There is no Arab here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer's heart gave a great leap.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dain!" he exclaimed.&nbsp; "At last! at last!&nbsp; I have been waiting



<P>for you every day and every night.&nbsp; I had nearly given you up."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing could have stopped me from coming back here," said the



<P>other, almost violently.&nbsp; "Not even death," he whispered to



<P>himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is a friend's talk, and is very good," said Almayer,



<P>heartily.&nbsp; "But you are too far here.&nbsp; Drop down to the jetty

and



<P>let your men cook their rice in my campong while we talk in the



<P>house."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was no answer to that invitation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is it?" asked Almayer, uneasily.&nbsp; "There is nothing wrong



<P>with the brig, I hope?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The brig is where no Orang Blanda can lay his hands on her,"



<P>said Dain, with a gloomy tone in his voice, which Almayer, in his



<P>elation, failed to notice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Right," he said.&nbsp; "But where are all your men?&nbsp; There are

only



<P>two with you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Listen, Tuan Almayer," said Dain.&nbsp; "To-morrow's sun shall see

me



<P>in your house, and then we will talk.&nbsp; Now I must go to the



<P>Rajah."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To the Rajah!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; What do you want with Lakamba?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tuan, to-morrow we talk like friends.&nbsp; I must see Lakamba



<P>to-night."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dain, you are not going to abandon me now, when all is ready?"



<P>asked Almayer, in a pleading voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have I not returned?&nbsp; But I must see Lakamba first for your good



<P>and mine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The shadowy head disappeared abruptly.&nbsp; The bush, released from



<P>the grasp of the bowman, sprung back with a swish, scattering a



<P>shower of muddy water over Almayer, as he bent forward, trying to



<P>see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a little while the canoe shot into the streak of light that



<P>streamed on the river from the big fire on the opposite shore,



<P>disclosing the outline of two men bending to their work, and a



<P>third figure in the stern flourishing the steering paddle, his



<P>head covered with an enormous round hat, like a fantastically



<P>exaggerated mushroom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer watched the canoe till it passed out of the line of



<P>light.&nbsp; Shortly after the murmur of many voices reached him



<P>across the water.&nbsp; He could see the torches being snatched out

of



<P>the burning pile, and rendering visible for a moment the gate in



<P>the stockade round which they crowded.&nbsp; Then they went in



<P>apparently.&nbsp; The torches disappeared, and the scattered fire sent



<P>out only a dim and fitful glare.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer stepped homewards with long strides and mind uneasy.



<P>Surely Dain was not thinking of playing him false.&nbsp; It was



<P>absurd.&nbsp; Dain and Lakamba were both too much interested in the



<P>success of his scheme.&nbsp; Trusting to Malays was poor work; but



<P>then even Malays have some sense and understand their own



<P>interest.&nbsp; All would be well--must be well.&nbsp; At this point

in his



<P>meditation he found himself at the foot of the steps leading to



<P>the verandah of his home.&nbsp; From the low point of land where he



<P>stood he could see both branches of the river.&nbsp; The main branch



<P>of the Pantai was lost in complete darkness, for the fire at the



<P>Rajah's had gone out altogether; but up the Sambir reach his eye



<P>could follow the long line of Malay houses crowding the bank,



<P>with here and there a dim light twinkling through bamboo walls,



<P>or a smoky torch burning on the platforms built out over the



<P>river.&nbsp; Further away, where the island ended in a low cliff, rose



<P>a dark mass of buildings towering above the Malay structures.



<P>Founded solidly on a firm ground with plenty of space, starred by



<P>many lights burning strong and white, with a suggestion of



<P>paraffin and lamp-glasses, stood the house and the godowns of



<P>Abdulla bin Selim, the great trader of Sambir.&nbsp; To Almayer the



<P>sight was very distasteful, and he shook his fist towards the



<P>buildings that in their evident prosperity looked to him cold and



<P>insolent, and contemptuous of his own fallen fortunes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He mounted the steps of his house slowly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the middle of the verandah there was a round table.&nbsp; On it a



<P>paraffin lamp without a globe shed a hard glare on the three



<P>inner sides.&nbsp; The fourth side was open, and faced the river.



<P>Between the rough supports of the high-pitched roof hung torn



<P>rattan screens.&nbsp; There was no ceiling, and the harsh brilliance



<P>of the lamp was toned above into a soft half-light that lost



<P>itself in the obscurity amongst the rafters.&nbsp; The front wall was



<P>cut in two by the doorway of a central passage closed by a red



<P>curtain.&nbsp; The women's room opened into that passage, which led

to



<P>the back courtyard and to the cooking shed.&nbsp; In one of the side



<P>walls there was a doorway.&nbsp; Half obliterated words--"Office:



<P>Lingard and Co."--were still legible on the dusty door, which



<P>looked as if it had not been opened for a very long time.&nbsp; Close



<P>to the other side wall stood a bent-wood rocking-chair, and by



<P>the table and about the verandah four wooden armchairs straggled



<P>forlornly, as if ashamed of their shabby surroundings.&nbsp; A heap

of



<P>common mats lay in one corner, with an old hammock slung



<P>diagonally above.&nbsp; In the other corner, his head wrapped in a



<P>piece of red calico, huddled into a shapeless heap, slept a



<P>Malay, one of Almayer's domestic slaves--"my own people," he used



<P>to call them.&nbsp; A numerous and representative assembly of moths



<P>were holding high revels round the lamp to the spirited music of



<P>swarming mosquitoes.&nbsp; Under the palm-leaf thatch lizards raced

on



<P>the beams calling softly.&nbsp; A monkey, chained to one of the



<P>verandah supports--retired for the night under the eaves-- peered



<P>and grinned at Almayer, as it swung to one of the bamboo roof



<P>sticks and caused a shower of dust and bits of dried&nbsp; leaves to



<P>settle on the shabby table.&nbsp; The floor was uneven, with many



<P>withered plants and dried earth scattered about.&nbsp; A general air



<P>of squalid neglect pervaded the place.&nbsp; Great red stains on the



<P>floor and walls testified to frequent and indiscriminate



<P>betel-nut chewing.&nbsp; The light breeze from the river swayed gently



<P>the tattered blinds, sending from the woods opposite a faint and



<P>sickly perfume as of decaying flowers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Under Almayer's heavy tread the boards of the verandah creaked



<P>loudly.&nbsp; The sleeper in the corner moved uneasily, muttering



<P>indistinct words.&nbsp; There was a slight rustle behind the curtained



<P>doorway, and a soft voice asked in Malay, "Is it you, father?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Nina.&nbsp; I am hungry.&nbsp; Is everybody asleep in this house?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer spoke jovially and dropped with a contented sigh into the



<P>armchair nearest to the table.&nbsp; Nina Almayer came through the



<P>curtained doorway followed by an old Malay woman, who busied



<P>herself in setting upon the table a plateful of rice and fish, a



<P>jar of water, and a bottle half full of genever.&nbsp; After carefully



<P>placing before her master a cracked glass tumbler and a tin spoon



<P>she went away noiselessly.&nbsp; Nina stood by the table, one hand



<P>lightly resting on its edge, the other hanging listlessly by her



<P>side.&nbsp; Her face turned towards the outer darkness, through which



<P>her dreamy eyes seemed to see some entrancing picture, wore a



<P>look of impatient expectancy.&nbsp; She was tall for a half-caste,



<P>with the correct profile of the father, modified and strengthened



<P>by the squareness of the lower part of the face inherited from



<P>her maternal ancestors--the Sulu pirates.&nbsp; Her firm mouth, with



<P>the lips slightly parted and disclosing a gleam of white teeth,



<P>put a vague suggestion of ferocity into the impatient&nbsp; expression



<P>of her features.&nbsp; And yet her dark and perfect eyes had all the



<P>tender softness of expression common to Malay women, but with a



<P>gleam of superior intelligence; they looked gravely, wide open



<P>and steady, as if facing something invisible to all other eyes,



<P>while she stood there all in white, straight, flexible, graceful,



<P>unconscious of herself, her low but broad forehead crowned with a



<P>shining mass of long black hair that fell in heavy tresses over



<P>her shoulders, and made her pale olive complexion look paler



<P>still by the contrast of its coal-black hue.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer attacked his rice greedily, but after a few mouthfuls he



<P>paused, spoon in hand, and looked at his daughter curiously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did you hear a boat pass about half an hour ago Nina?" he asked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girl gave him a quick glance, and moving away from the light



<P>stood with her back to the table.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," she said, slowly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There was a boat.&nbsp; At last!&nbsp; Dain himself; and he went on

to



<P>Lakamba.&nbsp; I know it, for he told me so.&nbsp; I spoke to him, but

he



<P>would not come here to-night.&nbsp; Will come to-morrow, he said."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He swallowed another spoonful, then said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am almost happy to-night, Nina.&nbsp; I can see the end of a long



<P>road, and it leads us away from this miserable swamp.&nbsp; We shall



<P>soon get away from here, I and you, my dear little girl, and then



<P>--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He rose from the table and stood looking fixedly before him as if



<P>contemplating some enchanting vision.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And then," he went on, "we shall be happy, you and I.&nbsp; Live rich



<P>and respected far from here, and forget this life, and all this



<P>struggle, and all this misery!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He approached his daughter and passed his hand caressingly over



<P>her hair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is bad to have to trust a Malay," he said, "but I must own



<P>that this Dain is a perfect gentleman--a perfect gentleman," he



<P>repeated.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did you ask him to come here, father?" inquired Nina, not



<P>looking at him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, of course.&nbsp; We shall start on the day after to-morrow,"



<P>said Almayer, joyously.&nbsp; "We must not lose any time.&nbsp; Are

you



<P>glad, little girl?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was nearly as tall as himself, but he liked to recall the



<P>time when she was little and they were all in all to each other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am glad," she said, very low.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course," said Almayer, vivaciously, "you cannot imagine what



<P>is before you.&nbsp; I myself have not been to Europe, but I have



<P>heard my mother talk so often that I seem to know all about it.



<P>We shall live a--a glorious life.&nbsp; You shall see."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Again he stood silent by his daughter's side looking at that



<P>enchanting vision.&nbsp; After a while he shook his clenched hand



<P>towards the sleeping settlement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! my friend Abdulla," he cried, "we shall see who will have



<P>the best of it after all these years!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked up the river and remarked calmly:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Another thunderstorm.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; No thunder will keep me awake



<P>to-night, I know!&nbsp; Good-night, little girl," he whispered,



<P>tenderly kissing her cheek.&nbsp; "You do not seem to be very happy



<P>to-night, but to-morrow you will show a brighter face.&nbsp; Eh?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nina had listened to her father with her face unmoved, with her



<P>half-closed eyes still gazing into the night now made more



<P>intense by a heavy thunder-cloud that had crept down from the



<P>hills blotting out the stars, merging sky, forest, and river into



<P>one mass of almost palpable blackness.&nbsp; The faint breeze had died



<P>out, but the distant rumble of thunder and pale flashes of



<P>lightning gave warning of the approaching storm.&nbsp; With a sigh the



<P>girl turned towards the table.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer was in his hammock now, already half asleep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Take the lamp, Nina," he muttered, drowsily.&nbsp; "This place is



<P>full of mosquitoes.&nbsp; Go to sleep, daughter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Nina put the lamp out and turned back again towards the



<P>balustrade of the verandah, standing with her arm round the



<P>wooden support and looking eagerly towards the Pantai reach.&nbsp; And



<P>motionless there in the oppressive calm of the tropical night she



<P>could see at each flash of lightning the forest lining both banks



<P>up the river, bending before the furious blast of the coming



<P>tempest, the upper reach of the river whipped into white foam by



<P>the wind, and the black clouds torn into fantastic shapes



<P>trailing low over the swaying trees.&nbsp; Round her all was as yet



<P>stillness and peace, but she could hear afar off the roar of the



<P>wind, the hiss of heavy rain, the wash of the waves on the



<P>tormented river.&nbsp; It came nearer and nearer, with loud



<P>thunder-claps and long flashes of vivid lightning, followed by



<P>short periods of appalling blackness.&nbsp; When the storm reached the



<P>low point dividing the river, the house shook in the wind, and



<P>the rain pattered loudly on the palm-leaf roof, the thunder spoke



<P>in one prolonged roll, and the incessant lightning disclosed a



<P>turmoil of leaping waters, driving logs, and the big trees



<P>bending before a brutal and merciless force.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Undisturbed by the nightly event of the rainy monsoon, the father



<P>slept quietly, oblivious alike of his hopes, his misfortunes, his



<P>friends, and his enemies; and the daughter stood motionless, at



<P>each flash of lightning eagerly scanning the broad river with a



<P>steady and anxious gaze.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER II.</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>When, in compliance with Lingard's abrupt demand, Almayer



<P>consented to wed the Malay girl, no one knew that on the day when



<P>the interesting young convert had lost all her natural relations



<P>and found a white father, she had been fighting desperately like



<P>the rest of them on board the prau, and was only prevented from



<P>leaping overboard, like the few other survivors, by a severe



<P>wound in the leg.&nbsp; There, on the fore-deck of the prau, old



<P>Lingard found her under a heap of dead and dying pirates, and had



<P>her carried on the poop of the Flash before the Malay craft was



<P>set on fire and sent adrift.&nbsp; She was conscious, and in the great



<P>peace and stillness of the tropical evening succeeding the



<P>turmoil of the battle, she watched all she held dear on earth



<P>after her own savage manner, drift away into the gloom in a great



<P>roar of flame and smoke.&nbsp; She lay there unheeding the careful



<P>hands attending to her wound, silent and absorbed in gazing at



<P>the funeral pile of those brave men she had so much admired and



<P>so well helped in their contest with the redoubtable



<P>"Rajah-Laut."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The light night breeze fanned the brig gently to the southward,



<P>and the great blaze of light got smaller and smaller till it



<P>twinkled only on the horizon like a setting star.&nbsp; It set:&nbsp;

the



<P>heavy canopy of smoke reflected the glare of hidden flames for a



<P>short time and then disappeared also.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She realised that with this vanishing gleam her old life departed



<P>too.&nbsp; Thenceforth there was slavery in the far countries, amongst



<P>strangers, in unknown and perhaps terrible surroundings.&nbsp; Being



<P>fourteen years old, she realised her position and came to that



<P>conclusion, the only one possible to a Malay girl, soon ripened



<P>under a tropical sun, and not unaware of her personal charms, of



<P>which she heard many a young brave warrior of her father's crew



<P>express an appreciative admiration.&nbsp; There was in her the dread



<P>of the unknown; otherwise she accepted her position calmly, after



<P>the manner of her people, and even considered it quite natural;



<P>for was she not a daughter of warriors, conquered in battle, and



<P>did she not belong rightfully to the victorious Rajah?&nbsp; Even the



<P>evident kindness of the terrible old man must spring, she



<P>thought, from admiration for his captive, and the flattered



<P>vanity eased for her the pangs of sorrow after such an awful



<P>calamity.&nbsp; Perhaps had she known of the high walls, the quiet



<P>gardens, and the silent nuns of the Samarang convent, where her



<P>destiny was leading her, she would have sought death in her dread



<P>and hate of such a restraint.&nbsp; But in imagination she pictured

to



<P>herself the usual life of a Malay girl--the usual succession of



<P>heavy work and fierce love, of intrigues, gold ornaments, of



<P>domestic drudgery, and of that great but occult influence which



<P>is one of the few rights of half-savage womankind.&nbsp; But her



<P>destiny in the rough hands of the old sea-dog, acting under



<P>unreasoning impulses of the heart, took a strange and to her a



<P>terrible shape.&nbsp; She bore it all--the restraint and the teaching



<P>and the new faith--with calm submission, concealing her hate&nbsp; and



<P>contempt for all that new life.&nbsp; She learned the language very



<P>easily, yet understood but little of the new faith the good



<P>sisters taught her, assimilating quickly only the superstitious



<P>elements of the religion.&nbsp; She called Lingard father, gently and



<P>caressingly, at each of his short and noisy visits, under the



<P>clear impression that he was a great and dangerous power it was



<P>good to propitiate.&nbsp; Was he not now her master?&nbsp; And during

those



<P>long four years she nourished a hope of finding favour in his



<P>eyes and ultimately becoming his wife, counsellor, and guide.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Those dreams of the future were dispelled by the Rajah Laut's



<P>"fiat," which made Almayer's fortune, as that young man fondly



<P>hoped.&nbsp; And dressed in the hateful finery of Europe, the centre



<P>of an interested circle of Batavian society, the young convert



<P>stood before the altar with an unknown and sulky-looking white



<P>man.&nbsp; For Almayer was uneasy, a little disgusted, and greatly



<P>inclined to run away.&nbsp; A judicious fear of the adopted



<P>father-in-law and a just regard for his own material welfare



<P>prevented him from making a scandal; yet, while swearing



<P>fidelity, he was concocting plans for getting rid of the&nbsp; pretty



<P>Malay girl in a more or less distant future.&nbsp; She, however, had



<P>retained enough of conventual teaching to understand well that



<P>according to white men's laws she was going to be Almayer's



<P>companion and not his slave, and promised to herself to act



<P>accordingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So when the Flash freighted with materials for building a new



<P>house left the harbour of Batavia, taking away the young couple



<P>into the unknown Borneo, she did not carry on her deck so much



<P>love and happiness as old Lingard was wont to boast of before his



<P>casual friends in the verandahs of various hotels.&nbsp; The old



<P>seaman himself was perfectly happy.&nbsp; Now he had done his duty by



<P>the girl.&nbsp; "You know I made her an orphan," he often concluded



<P>solemnly, when talking about his own affairs to a scratch



<P>audience of shore loafers--as it was his habit to do.&nbsp; And the



<P>approbative shouts of his half-intoxicated auditors filled his



<P>simple soul with delight and pride.&nbsp; "I carry everything right



<P>through," was another of his sayings, and in pursuance of that



<P>principle he pushed the building of house and godowns on the



<P>Pantai River with feverish haste.&nbsp; The house for the young



<P>couple; the godowns for the big trade Almayer was going to



<P>develop while he (Lingard) would be able to give himself up to



<P>some mysterious work which was only spoken of in hints, but was



<P>understood to relate to gold and diamonds in the interior of the



<P>island.&nbsp; Almayer was impatient too.&nbsp; Had he known what was

before



<P>him he might not have been so eager and full of hope as he stood



<P>watching the last canoe of the Lingard expedition disappear in



<P>the bend up the river.&nbsp; When, turning round, he beheld the pretty



<P>little house, the big godowns built neatly by an army of Chinese



<P>carpenters, the new jetty round which were clustered the trading



<P>canoes, he felt a sudden elation in the thought that the world



<P>was his.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the world had to be conquered first, and its conquest was not



<P>so easy as he thought.&nbsp; He was very soon made to understand that



<P>he was not wanted in that corner of it where old Lingard and his



<P>own weak will placed him, in the midst of unscrupulous intrigues



<P>and of a fierce trade competition.&nbsp; The Arabs had found out the



<P>river, had established a trading post in Sambir, and where they



<P>traded they would be masters and suffer no rival.&nbsp; Lingard



<P>returned unsuccessful from his first expedition, and departed



<P>again spending all the profits of the legitimate trade on his



<P>mysterious journeys.&nbsp; Almayer struggled with the difficulties of



<P>his position, friendless and unaided, save for the protection



<P>given to him for Lingard's sake by the old Rajah, the predecessor



<P>of Lakamba.&nbsp; Lakamba himself, then living as a private individual



<P>on a rice clearing, seven miles down the river, exercised all his



<P>influence towards the help of the white man's enemies, plotting



<P>against the old Rajah and Almayer with a certainty of



<P>combination, pointing clearly to a profound knowledge of their



<P>most secret affairs.&nbsp; Outwardly friendly, his portly form was



<P>often to be seen on Almayer's verandah; his green turban and



<P>gold-embroidered jacket shone in the front rank of the decorous



<P>throng of Malays coming to greet Lingard on his returns from the



<P>interior; his salaams were of the lowest, and his hand-shakings



<P>of the heartiest, when welcoming the old trader.&nbsp; But his small



<P>eyes took in the signs of the times, and he departed from those



<P>interviews with a satisfied and furtive smile to hold long



<P>consultations with his friend and ally, Syed Abdulla, the&nbsp; chief



<P>of the Arab trading post, a man of great wealth and of great



<P>influence in the islands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was currently believed at that time in the settlement that



<P>Lakamba's visits to Almayer's house were not limited to those



<P>official interviews.&nbsp; Often on moonlight nights the belated



<P>fishermen of Sambira saw a small canoe shooting out from the



<P>narrow creek at the back of the white man's house, and the



<P>solitary occupant paddle cautiously down the river in the deep



<P>shadows of the bank; and those events, duly reported, were



<P>discussed round the evening fires far into the night with the



<P>cynicism of expression common to aristocratic Malays, and with a



<P>malicious pleasure in the domestic misfortunes of the Orang



<P>Blando--the hated Dutchman.&nbsp; Almayer went on struggling



<P>desperately, but with a feebleness of purpose depriving him of



<P>all chance of success against men so unscrupulous and resolute as



<P>his rivals the Arabs.&nbsp; The trade fell away from the large



<P>godowns, and the godowns themselves rotted piecemeal.&nbsp; The old



<P>man's banker, Hudig of Macassar, failed, and with this went the



<P>whole available capital.&nbsp; The profits of past years had been



<P>swallowed up in Lingard's exploring craze.&nbsp; Lingard was in the



<P>interior--perhaps dead--at all events giving no sign of life.



<P>Almayer stood alone in the midst of those adverse circumstances,



<P>deriving only a little comfort from the companionship of his



<P>little daughter, born two years after the marriage, and at the



<P>time some six years old.&nbsp; His wife had soon commenced to treat



<P>him with a savage contempt expressed by sulky silence, only



<P>occasionally varied by a flood of savage invective.&nbsp; He felt she



<P>hated him, and saw her jealous eyes watching himself and the



<P>child with almost an expression of hate.&nbsp; She was jealous of the



<P>little girl's evident preference for the father, and Almayer felt



<P>he was not safe with that woman in the house.&nbsp; While she was



<P>burning the furniture, and tearing down the pretty curtains in



<P>her unreasoning hate of those signs of civilisation, Almayer,



<P>cowed by these outbursts of savage nature, meditated in silence



<P>on the best way of getting rid of her.&nbsp; He thought of everything;



<P>even planned murder in an undecided and feeble sort of way, but



<P>dared do nothing--expecting every day the return of Lingard with



<P>news of some immense good fortune.&nbsp; He returned indeed, but aged,



<P>ill, a ghost of his former self, with the fire of fever burning



<P>in his sunken eyes, almost the only survivor of the numerous



<P>expedition.&nbsp; But he was successful at last!&nbsp; Untold riches

were



<P>in his grasp; he wanted more money--only a little more torealise



<P>a dream of fabulous fortune.&nbsp; And Hudig had failed!&nbsp; Almayer



<P>scraped all he could together, but the old man wanted more.&nbsp; If



<P>Almayer could not get it he would go to Singapore--to Europe



<P>even, but before all to Singapore; and he would take the little



<P>Nina with him.&nbsp; The child must be brought up decently.&nbsp; He

had



<P>good friends in Singapore who would take care of her and have her



<P>taught properly.&nbsp; All would be well, and that girl, upon whom the



<P>old seaman seemed to have transferred all his former affection



<P>for the mother, would be the richest woman in the East--in the



<P>world even.&nbsp; So old Lingard shouted, pacing the verandah with his



<P>heavy quarter-deck step, gesticulating with a smouldering



<P>cheroot; ragged, dishevelled, enthusiastic; and Almayer, sitting



<P>huddled up on a pile of mats, thought with dread of the



<P>separation with the only human being he loved--with greater dread



<P>still, perhaps, of the scene with his wife, the savage tigress



<P>deprived of her young.&nbsp; She will poison me, thought the poor



<P>wretch, well aware of that easy and final manner of solving&nbsp; the



<P>social, political, or family problems in Malay life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To his great surprise she took the news very quietly, giving only



<P>him and Lingard a furtive glance, and saying not a word.&nbsp; This,



<P>however, did not prevent her the next day from jumping into the



<P>river and swimming after the boat in which Lingard was carrying



<P>away the nurse with the screaming child.&nbsp; Almayer had to give



<P>chase with his whale-boat and drag her in by the hair in the



<P>midst of cries and curses enough to make heaven fall.&nbsp; Yet after



<P>two days spent in wailing, she returned to her former mode of



<P>life, chewing betel-nut, and sitting all day amongst her women in



<P>stupefied idleness.&nbsp; She aged very rapidly after that, and only



<P>roused herself from her apathy to acknowledge by a scathing



<P>remark or an insulting exclamation the accidental presence of her



<P>husband.&nbsp; He had built for her a riverside hut in the compound



<P>where she dwelt in perfect seclusion.&nbsp; Lakamba's visits had



<P>ceased when, by a convenient decree of Providence and the help of



<P>a little scientific manipulation, the old ruler of Sambir



<P>departed this life.&nbsp; Lakamba reigned in his stead now, having



<P>been well served by his Arab friends with the Dutch authorities.



<P>Syed Abdulla was the great man and trader of the Pantai.&nbsp; Almayer



<P>lay ruined and helpless under the close-meshed net of their



<P>intrigues, owing his life only to his supposed knowledge of



<P>Lingard's valuable secret.&nbsp; Lingard had disappeared.&nbsp; He wrote



<P>once from Singapore saying the child was well, and under the care



<P>of a Mrs. Vinck, and that he himself was going to Europe to raise



<P>money for the great enterprise.&nbsp; "He was coming back soon.&nbsp;

There



<P>would be no difficulties," he wrote; "people would rush in with



<P>their money."&nbsp; Evidently they did not, for there was only one



<P>letter more from him saying he was ill, had found no relation



<P>living, but little else besides.&nbsp; Then came a complete silence.



<P>Europe had swallowed up the Rajah Laut apparently, and Almayer



<P>looked vainly westward for a ray of light out of the gloom of



<P>his shattered hopes.&nbsp; Years passed, and the rare letters from



<P>Mrs. Vinck, later on from the girl herself, were the only thing



<P>to be looked to to make life bearable amongst the triumphant



<P>savagery of the river.&nbsp; Almayer lived now alone, having even



<P>ceased to visit his debtors who would not pay, sure of Lakamba's



<P>protection.&nbsp; The faithful Sumatrese Ali cooked his rice and made



<P>his coffee, for he dared not trust any one else, and least of all



<P>his wife.&nbsp; He killed time wandering sadly in the overgrown paths



<P>round the house, visiting the ruined godowns where a few brass



<P>guns covered with verdigris and only a few broken cases of



<P>mouldering Manchester goods reminded him of the good early times



<P>when all this was full of life and merchandise, and he overlooked



<P>a busy scene on the river bank, his little daughter by his side.



<P>Now the up-country canoes glided past the little rotten wharf of



<P>Lingard and Co., to paddle up the Pantai branch, and cluster



<P>round the new jetty belonging to Abdulla.&nbsp; Not that they loved



<P>Abdulla, but they dared not trade with the man whose star had



<P>set.&nbsp; Had they done so they knew there was no mercy to be



<P>expected from Arab or Rajah; no rice to be got on credit in the



<P>times of scarcity from either; and Almayer could not help them,



<P>having at times hardly enough for himself.&nbsp; Almayer, in his



<P>isolation and despair, often envied his near neighbour the



<P>Chinaman, Jim-Eng, whom he could see stretched on a pile of cool



<P>mats, a wooden pillow under his head, an opium pipe in his



<P>nerveless fingers.&nbsp; He did not seek, however, consolation in



<P>opium--perhaps it was too expensive--perhaps his white man's



<P>pride saved him from that degradation; but most likely it was the



<P>thought of his little daughter in the far-off Straits



<P>Settlements.&nbsp; He heard from her oftener since Abdulla bought a



<P>steamer, which ran now between Singapore and the Pantai



<P>settlement every three months or so.&nbsp; Almayer felt himself nearer



<P>his daughter.&nbsp; He longed to see her, and planned a voyage to



<P>Singapore, but put off his departure from year to year, always



<P>expecting some favourable turn of fortune.&nbsp; He did not want to



<P>meet her with empty hands and with no words of hope on his lips.



<P>He could not take her back into that savage life to which he was



<P>condemned himself.&nbsp; He was also a little afraid of her.&nbsp; What



<P>would she think of him?&nbsp; He reckoned the years.&nbsp; A grown woman.



<P>A civilised woman, young and hopeful; while he felt old and



<P>hopeless, and very much like those savages round him.&nbsp; He asked



<P>himself what was going to be her future.&nbsp; He could not answer



<P>that question yet, and he dared not face her.&nbsp; And yet he longed



<P>after her.&nbsp; He hesitated for years.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His hesitation was put an end to by Nina's unexpected appearance



<P>in Sambir.&nbsp; She arrived in the steamer under the captain's care.



<P>Almayer beheld her with surprise not unmixed with wonder.&nbsp; During



<P>those ten years the child had changed into a woman, black-haired,



<P>olive-skinned, tall, and beautiful, with great sad eyes, where



<P>the startled expression common to Malay womankind was modified by



<P>a thoughtful tinge inherited from her European ancestry.&nbsp; Almayer



<P>thought with dismay of the meeting of his wife and daughter, of



<P>what this grave girl in European clothes would think of her



<P>betel-nut chewing mother, squatting in a dark hut, disorderly,



<P>half naked, and sulky.&nbsp; He also feared an outbreak of temper on



<P>the part of that pest of a woman he had hitherto managed to keep



<P>tolerably quiet, thereby saving the remnants of his dilapidated



<P>furniture.&nbsp; And he stood there before the closed door of the hut



<P>in the blazing sunshine listening to the murmur of voices,



<P>wondering what went on inside, wherefrom all the servant-maids



<P>had been expelled at the beginning of the interview, and now



<P>stood clustered by the palings with half-covered faces in a



<P>chatter of curious speculation.&nbsp; He forgot himself there trying



<P>to catch a stray word through the bamboo walls, till the captain



<P>of the steamer, who had walked up with the girl, fearing a



<P>sunstroke, took him under the arm and led him into the shade of



<P>his own verandah:&nbsp; where Nina's trunk stood already, having been



<P>landed by the steamer's men.&nbsp; As soon as Captain Ford had his



<P>glass before him and his cheroot lighted, Almayer asked for the



<P>explanation of his daughter's unexpected arrival.&nbsp; Ford said



<P>little beyond generalising in vague but violent terms upon the



<P>foolishness of women in general, and of Mrs. Vinck in particular.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You know, Kaspar," said he, in conclusion, to the excited



<P>Almayer, "it is deucedly awkward to have a half-caste girl in the



<P>house.&nbsp; There's such a lot of fools about.&nbsp; There was that

young



<P>fellow from the bank who used to ride to the Vinck bungalow early



<P>and late.&nbsp; That old woman thought it was for that Emma of hers.



<P>When she found out what he wanted exactly, there was a row, I can



<P>tell you.&nbsp; She would not have Nina--not an hour longer--in the



<P>house.&nbsp; Fact is, I heard of this affair and took the girl to my



<P>wife.&nbsp; My wife is a pretty good woman--as women go--and upon my



<P>word we would have kept the girl for you, only she would not



<P>stay.&nbsp; Now, then!&nbsp; Don't flare up, Kaspar.&nbsp; Sit still.&nbsp;

What can



<P>you do?&nbsp; It is better so.&nbsp; Let her stay with you.&nbsp; She

was never



<P>happy over there.&nbsp; Those two Vinck girls are no better than



<P>dressed-up monkeys.&nbsp; They slighted her.&nbsp; You can't make her



<P>white.&nbsp; It's no use you swearing at me.&nbsp; You can't.&nbsp;

She is a



<P>good girl for all that, but she would not tell my wife anything.



<P>If you want to know, ask her yourself; but if I was you I would



<P>leave her alone.&nbsp; You are welcome to her passage money, old



<P>fellow, if you are short now."&nbsp; And the skipper, throwing away



<P>his cigar, walked off to "wake them up on board," as he expressed



<P>it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer vainly expected to hear of the cause of his daughter's



<P>return from his daughter's lips.&nbsp; Not that day, not on any other



<P>day did she ever allude to her Singapore life.&nbsp; He did not care



<P>to ask, awed by the calm impassiveness of her face, by those



<P>solemn eyes looking past him on the great, still forests sleeping



<P>in majestic repose to the murmur of the broad river.&nbsp; He accepted



<P>the situation, happy in the gentle and protecting affection the



<P>girl showed him, fitfully enough, for she had, as she called it,



<P>her bad days when she used to visit her mother and remain long



<P>hours in the riverside hut, coming out as inscrutable as ever,



<P>but with a contemptuous look and a short word ready to answer any



<P>of his speeches.&nbsp; He got used even to that, and on those days



<P>kept quiet, although greatly alarmed by his wife's influence upon



<P>the girl.&nbsp; Otherwise Nina adapted herself wonderfully to the



<P>circumstances of a half-savage and miserable life.&nbsp; She accepted



<P>without question or apparent disgust the neglect, the decay,&nbsp; the



<P>poverty of the household, the absence of furniture, and the



<P>preponderance of rice diet on the family table.&nbsp; She lived with



<P>Almayer in the little house (now sadly decaying) built originally



<P>by Lingard for the young couple.&nbsp; The Malays eagerly discussed



<P>her arrival.&nbsp; There were at the beginning crowded levees of Malay



<P>women with their children, seeking eagerly after "Ubat" for all



<P>the ills of the flesh from the young Mem Putih.&nbsp; In the cool of



<P>the evening grave Arabs in long white shirts and yellow



<P>sleeveless jackets walked slowly on the dusty path by the



<P>riverside towards Almayer's gate, and made solemn calls upon that



<P>Unbeliever under shallow pretences of business, only to get a



<P>glimpse of the young girl in a highly decorous manner.&nbsp; Even



<P>Lakamba came out of his stockade in a great pomp of war canoes



<P>and red umbrellas, and landed on the rotten little jetty of



<P>Lingard and Co.&nbsp; He came, he said, to buy a couple of brass guns



<P>as a present to his friend the chief of Sambir Dyaks; and while



<P>Almayer, suspicious but polite, busied himself in unearthing the



<P>old popguns in the godowns, the Rajah sat on an armchair in the



<P>verandah, surrounded by his respectful retinue waiting in vain



<P>for Nina's appearance.&nbsp; She was in one of her bad days, and



<P>remained in her mother's hut watching with her the ceremonious



<P>proceedings on the verandah.&nbsp; The Rajah departed, baffled but



<P>courteous, and soon Almayer began to reap the benefit of



<P>improved relations with the ruler in the shape of the recovery of



<P>some debts, paid to him with many apologies and many a low salaam



<P>by debtors till then considered hopelessly insolvent.&nbsp; Under



<P>these improving circumstances Almayer brightened up a little.



<P>All was not lost perhaps.&nbsp; Those Arabs and Malays saw at last



<P>that he was a man of some ability, he thought.&nbsp; And he began,



<P>after his manner, to plan great things, to dream of great



<P>fortunes for himself and Nina.&nbsp; Especially for Nina!&nbsp; Under

these



<P>vivifying impulses he asked Captain Ford to write to his friends



<P>in England making inquiries after Lingard.&nbsp; Was he alive or dead?



<P>If dead, had he left any papers, documents; any indications or



<P>hints as to his great enterprise?&nbsp; Meantime he had found amongst



<P>the rubbish in one of the empty rooms a note-book belonging to



<P>the old adventurer.&nbsp; He studied the crabbed handwriting of its



<P>pages and often grew meditative over it.&nbsp; Other things also woke



<P>him up from his apathy.&nbsp; The stir made in the whole of the island



<P>by the establishment of the British Borneo Company affected even



<P>the sluggish flow of the Pantai life.&nbsp; Great changes were



<P>expected; annexation was talked of; the Arabs grew civil.



<P>Almayer began building his new house for the use of the future



<P>engineers, agents, or settlers of the new Company.&nbsp; He spent



<P>every available guilder on it with a confiding heart.&nbsp; One thing



<P>only disturbed his happiness:&nbsp; his wife came out of her



<P>seclusion, importing her green jacket, scant sarongs, shrill



<P>voice, and witch-like appearance, into his quiet life in the



<P>small bungalow.&nbsp; And his daughter seemed to accept that savage



<P>intrusion into their daily existence with wonderful equanimity.



<P>He did not like it, but dared say nothing.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The deliberations conducted in London have a far-reaching



<P>importance, and so the decision issued from the fog-veiled



<P>offices of the Borneo Company darkened for Almayer the brilliant



<P>sunshine of the Tropics, and added another drop of bitterness to



<P>the cup of his disenchantments.&nbsp; The claim to that part of the



<P>East Coast was abandoned, leaving the Pantai river under the



<P>nominal power of Holland.&nbsp; In Sambir there was joy and



<P>excitement.&nbsp; The slaves were hurried out of sight into the forest



<P>and jungle, and the flags were run up to tall poles in the



<P>Rajah's compound in expectation of a visit from Dutch man-of-war



<P>boats.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The frigate remained anchored outside the mouth of the river, and



<P>the boats came up in tow of the steam launch, threading their way



<P>cautiously amongst a crowd of canoes filled with gaily dressed



<P>Malays.&nbsp; The officer in command listened gravely to the loyal



<P>speeches of Lakamba, returned the salaams of Abdulla, and assured



<P>those gentlemen in choice Malay of the great Rajah's--down in



<P>Batavia--friendship and goodwill towards the ruler and



<P>inhabitants of this model state of Sambir.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer from his verandah watched across the river the festive



<P>proceedings, heard the report of brass guns saluting the new flag



<P>presented to Lakamba, and the deep murmur of the crowd of



<P>spectators surging round the stockade.&nbsp; The smoke of the firing



<P>rose in white clouds on the green background of the forests, and



<P>he could not help comparing his own fleeting hopes to the rapidly



<P>disappearing vapour.&nbsp; He was by no means patriotically elated by



<P>the event, yet he had to force himself into a gracious behaviour



<P>when, the official reception being over, the naval officers of



<P>the Commission crossed the river to pay a visit to the solitary



<P>white man of whom they had heard, no doubt wishing also to catch



<P>a glimpse of his daughter.&nbsp; In that they were disappointed, Nina



<P>refusing to show herself; but they seemed easily consoled by the



<P>gin and cheroots set before them by the hospitable Almayer; and



<P>sprawling comfortably on the lame armchairs under the shade of



<P>the verandah, while the blazing sunshine outside seemed to&nbsp; set



<P>the great river simmering in the heat, they filled the little



<P>bungalow with the unusual sounds of European languages, with



<P>noise and laughter produced by naval witticisms at the expense of



<P>the fat Lakamba whom they had been complimenting so much that



<P>very morning.&nbsp; The younger men in an access of good fellowship



<P>made their host talk, and Almayer, excited by the sight of



<P>European faces, by the sound of European voices, opened his heart



<P>before the sympathising strangers, unaware of the amusement the



<P>recital of his many misfortunes caused to those future admirals.



<P>They drank his health, wished him many big diamonds and a



<P>mountain of gold, expressed even an envy of the high destinies



<P>awaiting him yet.&nbsp; Encouraged by so much friendliness, the



<P>grey-headed and foolish dreamer invited his guests to visit his



<P>new house.&nbsp; They went there through the long grass in a



<P>straggling procession while their boats were got ready for the



<P>return down the river in the cool of the evening.&nbsp; And in the



<P>great empty rooms where the tepid wind entering through the



<P>sashless windows whirled gently the dried leaves and the dust of



<P>many days of neglect, Almayer in his white jacket and flowered



<P>sarong, surrounded by a circle of glittering uniforms, stamped



<P>his foot to show the solidity of the neatly-fitting floors and



<P>expatiated upon the beauties and convenience of the building.



<P>They listened and assented, amazed by the wonderful simplicity



<P>and the foolish hopefulness of the man, till Almayer, carried



<P>away by his excitement, disclosed his regret at the non-arrival



<P>of the English, "who knew how to develop a rich country," as he



<P>expressed it.&nbsp; There was a general laugh amongst the Dutch



<P>officers at that unsophisticated statement, and a move was made



<P>towards the boats; but when Almayer, stepping cautiously on the



<P>rotten boards of the Lingard jetty, tried to approach the chief



<P>of the Commission with some timid hints anent the protection



<P>required by the Dutch subject against the wily Arabs, that salt



<P>water diplomat told him significantly that the Arabs were better



<P>subjects than Hollanders who dealt illegally in gunpowder with



<P>the Malays.&nbsp; The innocent Almayer recognised there at once the



<P>oily tongue of Abdulla and the solemn persuasiveness of Lakamba,



<P>but ere he had time to frame an indignant protest the steam



<P>launch and the string of boats moved rapidly down the river



<P>leaving him on the jetty, standing open-mouthed in his surprise



<P>and anger.&nbsp; There are thirty miles of river from Sambir to&nbsp;

the



<P>gem-like islands of the estuary where the frigate was awaiting



<P>the return of the boats.&nbsp; The moon rose long before the boats had



<P>traversed half that distance, and the black forest sleeping



<P>peacefully under her cold rays woke up that night to the ringing



<P>laughter in the small flotilla provoked by some reminiscence of



<P>Almayer's lamentable narrative.&nbsp; Salt-water jests at the poor



<P>man's expense were passed from boat to boat, the non-appearance



<P>of his daughter was commented upon with severe displeasure, and



<P>the half-finished house built for the reception of Englishmen



<P>received on that joyous night the name of "Almayer's Folly" by



<P>the unanimous vote of the lighthearted seamen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For many weeks after this visit life in Sambir resumed its even



<P>and uneventful flow.&nbsp; Each day's sun shooting its morning rays



<P>above the tree-tops lit up the usual scene of daily activity.



<P>Nina walking on the path that formed the only street in the



<P>settlement saw the accustomed sight of men lolling on the shady



<P>side of the houses, on the high platforms; of women busily



<P>engaged in husking the daily rice; of naked brown children racing



<P>along the shady and narrow paths leading to the clearings.



<P>Jim-Eng, strolling before his house, greeted her with a friendly



<P>nod before climbing up indoors to seek his beloved opium pipe.



<P>The elder children clustered round her, daring from long



<P>acquaintance, pulling the skirts of her white robe with their



<P>dark fingers, and showing their brilliant teeth in expectation



<P>of a shower of glass beads.&nbsp; She greeted them with a quiet smile,



<P>but always had a few friendly words for a Siamese girl, a slave



<P>owned by Bulangi, whose numerous wives were said to be of a



<P>violent temper.&nbsp; Well-founded rumour said also that the domestic



<P>squabbles of that industrious cultivator ended generally in a



<P>combined assault of all his wives upon the Siamese slave.&nbsp; The



<P>girl herself never complained--perhaps from dictates of prudence,



<P>but more likely through the strange, resigned apathy of



<P>half-savage womankind.&nbsp; From early morning she was to be seen on



<P>the paths amongst the houses--by the riverside or on the jetties,



<P>the tray of pastry, it was her mission to sell, skilfully



<P>balanced on her head.&nbsp; During the great heat of the day she



<P>usually sought refuge in Almayer's campong, often finding shelter



<P>in a shady corner of the verandah, where she squatted with her



<P>tray before her, when invited by Nina.&nbsp; For "Mem Putih" she had



<P>always a smile, but the presence of Mrs. Almayer, the very sound



<P>of her shrill voice, was the signal for a hurried departure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To this girl Nina often spoke; the other inhabitants of Sambir



<P>seldom or never heard the sound of her voice.&nbsp; They got used to



<P>the silent figure moving in their midst calm and white-robed, a



<P>being from another world and incomprehensible to them.&nbsp; Yet



<P>Nina's life for all her outward composure, for all the seeming



<P>detachment from the things and people surrounding her, was far



<P>from quiet, in consequence of Mrs. Almayer being much too active



<P>for the happiness and even safety of the household.&nbsp; She had



<P>resumed some intercourse with Lakamba, not personally, it is true



<P>(for the dignity of that potentate kept him inside his stockade),



<P>but through the agency of that potentate's prime minister,



<P>harbour master, financial adviser, and general factotum.&nbsp;&nbsp;

That



<P>gentleman--of Sulu origin--was certainly endowed with



<P>statesmanlike qualities, although he was totally devoid of



<P>personal charms.&nbsp; In truth he was perfectly repulsive, possessing



<P>only one eye and a pockmarked face, with nose and lips horribly



<P>disfigured by the small-pox.&nbsp; This unengaging individual often



<P>strolled into Almayer's garden in unofficial costume, composed of



<P>a piece of pink calico round his waist.&nbsp; There at the back of the



<P>house, squatting on his heels on scattered embers, in close



<P>proximity to the great iron boiler, where the family daily rice



<P>was being cooked by the women under Mrs. Almayer's



<P>superintendence, did that astute negotiator carry on long



<P>conversations in Sulu language with Almayer's wife.&nbsp; What the



<P>subject of their discourses was might have been guessed from the



<P>subsequent domestic scenes by Almayer's hearthstone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of late Almayer had taken to excursions up the river.&nbsp; In a small



<P>canoe with two paddlers and the faithful Ali for a steersman he



<P>would disappear for a few days at a time.&nbsp; All his movements were



<P>no doubt closely watched by Lakamba and Abdulla, for the man once



<P>in the confidence of Rajah Laut was supposed to be in possession



<P>of valuable secrets.&nbsp; The coast population of Borneo believes



<P>implicitly in diamonds of fabulous value, in gold mines of



<P>enormous richness in the interior.&nbsp; And all those imaginings are



<P>heightened by the difficulty of penetrating far inland,



<P>especially on the north-east coast, where the Malays and the



<P>river tribes of Dyaks or Head-hunters are eternally quarrelling.



<P>It is true enough that some gold reaches the coast in the hands



<P>of those Dyaks when, during short periods of truce in the



<P>desultory warfare, they visit the coast settlements of Malays.



<P>And so the wildest exaggerations are built up and added to on the



<P>slight basis of that fact.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer in his quality of white man--as Lingard before him--had



<P>somewhat better relations with the up-river tribes.&nbsp; Yet even his



<P>excursions were not without danger, and his returns were eagerly



<P>looked for by the impatient Lakamba.&nbsp; But every time the Rajah



<P>was disappointed.&nbsp; Vain were the conferences by the rice-pot of



<P>his factotum Babalatchi with the white man's wife.&nbsp; The white man



<P>himself was impenetrable--impenetrable to persuasion, coaxing,



<P>abuse; to soft words and shrill revilings; to desperate



<P>beseechings or murderous threats; for Mrs. Almayer, in her



<P>extreme desire to persuade her husband into an alliance with



<P>Lakamba, played upon the whole gamut of passion.&nbsp; With her soiled



<P>robe wound tightly under the armpits across her lean bosom, her



<P>scant grayish hair tumbled in disorder over her projecting



<P>cheek-bones, in suppliant attitude, she depicted with shrill



<P>volubility the advantages of close union with a man so good and



<P>so fair dealing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why don't you go to the Rajah?" she screamed.&nbsp; "Why do you go



<P>back to those Dyaks in the great forest?&nbsp; They should be killed.



<P>You cannot kill them, you cannot; but our Rajah's men are brave!



<P>You tell the Rajah where the old white man's treasure is.&nbsp; Our



<P>Rajah is good!&nbsp; He is our very grandfather, Datu Besar!&nbsp; He

will



<P>kill those wretched Dyaks, and you shall have half the treasure.



<P>Oh, Kaspar, tell where the treasure is!&nbsp; Tell me!&nbsp; Tell me

out of



<P>the old man's surat where you read so often at night"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On those occasions Almayer sat with rounded shoulders bending to



<P>the blast of this domestic tempest, accentuating only each pause



<P>in the torrent of his wife's eloquence by an angry growl, "There



<P>is no treasure!&nbsp; Go away, woman!"&nbsp; Exasperated by the sight

of



<P>his patiently bent back, she would at last walk round so as to



<P>face him across the table, and clasping her robe with one hand



<P>she stretched the other lean arm and claw-like hand to emphasise,



<P>in a passion of anger and contempt, the rapid rush of scathing



<P>remarks and bitter cursings heaped on the head of the man



<P>unworthy to associate with brave Malay chiefs.&nbsp; It ended



<P>generally by Almayer rising slowly, his long pipe in hand, his



<P>face set into a look of inward pain, and walking away in silence.



<P>He descended the steps and plunged into the long grass on his way



<P>to the solitude of his new house, dragging his feet in a state of



<P>physical collapse from disgust and fear before that fury.&nbsp; She



<P>followed to the head of the steps, and sent the shafts of



<P>indiscriminate abuse after the retreating form.&nbsp; And each of



<P>those scenes was concluded by a piercing shriek, reaching him far



<P>away.&nbsp; "You know, Kaspar, I am your wife! your own Christian wife



<P>after your own Blanda law!"&nbsp; For she knew that this was the



<P>bitterest thing of all; the greatest regret of that man's life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All these scenes Nina witnessed unmoved.&nbsp; She might have been



<P>deaf, dumb, without any feeling as far as any expression of



<P>opinion went.&nbsp; Yet oft when her father had sought the refuge of



<P>the great dusty rooms of "Almayer's Folly," and her mother,



<P>exhausted by rhetorical efforts, squatted wearily on her heels



<P>with her back against the leg of the table, Nina would approach



<P>her curiously, guarding her skirts from betel juice besprinkling



<P>the floor, and gaze down upon her as one might look into the



<P>quiescent crater of a volcano after a destructive eruption.&nbsp; Mrs.



<P>Almayer's thoughts, after these scenes, were usually turned into



<P>a channel of childhood reminiscences, and she gave them



<P>utterance in a kind of monotonous recitative--slightly



<P>disconnected, but generally describing the glories of the Sultan



<P>of Sulu, his great splendour, his power, his great prowess; the



<P>fear which benumbed the hearts of white men at the sight of his



<P>swift piratical praus.&nbsp; And these muttered statements of her



<P>grandfather's might were mixed up with bits of later



<P>recollections, where the great fight with the "White Devil's"



<P>brig and the convent life in Samarang occupied the principal



<P>place.&nbsp; At that point she usually dropped the thread of her



<P>narrative, and pulling out the little brass cross, always



<P>suspended round her neck, she contemplated it with superstitious



<P>awe.&nbsp; That superstitious feeling connected with some vague



<P>talismanic properties of the little bit of metal, and the still



<P>more hazy but terrible notion of some bad Djinns and horrible



<P>torments invented, as she thought, for her especial punishment by



<P>the good Mother Superior in case of the loss of the above charm,



<P>were Mrs. Almayer's only theological luggage for the stormy road



<P>of life.&nbsp; Mrs. Almayer had at least something tangible to cling



<P>to, but Nina, brought up under the Protestant wing of the proper



<P>Mrs. Vinck, had not even a little piece of brass to remind her of



<P>past teaching.&nbsp; And listening to the recital of those savage



<P>glories, those barbarous fights and savage feasting, to the story



<P>of deeds valorous, albeit somewhat bloodthirsty, where men of her



<P>mother's race shone far above the Orang Blanda, she felt herself



<P>irresistibly fascinated, and saw with vague surprise the narrow



<P>mantle of civilised morality, in which good-meaning people had



<P>wrapped her young soul, fall away and leave her shivering and



<P>helpless as if on the edge of some deep and unknown abyss.



<P>Strangest of all, this abyss did not frighten her when she was



<P>under the influence of the witch-like being she called her



<P>mother.&nbsp; She seemed to have forgotten in civilised surroundings



<P>her life before the time when Lingard had, so to speak, kidnapped



<P>her from Brow.&nbsp; Since then she had had Christian teaching, social



<P>education, and a good glimpse of civilised life.&nbsp; Unfortunately



<P>her teachers did not understand her nature, and the education



<P>ended in a scene of humiliation, in an outburst of contempt from



<P>white people for her mixed blood.&nbsp; She had tasted the whole



<P>bitterness of it and remembered distinctly that the virtuous Mrs.



<P>Vinck's indignation was not so much directed against the young



<P>man from the bank as against the innocent cause of that young



<P>man's infatuation.&nbsp; And there was also no doubt in her mind that



<P>the principal cause of Mrs. Vinck's indignation was the thought



<P>that such a thing should happen in a white nest, where her



<P>snow-white doves, the two Misses Vinck, had just returned from



<P>Europe, to find shelter under the maternal wing, and there await



<P>the coming of irreproachable men of their destiny.&nbsp; Not even the



<P>thought of the money so painfully scraped together by Almayer,



<P>and so punctually sent for Nina's expenses, could dissuade Mrs.



<P>Vinck from her virtuous resolve.&nbsp; Nina was sent away, and in



<P>truth the girl herself wanted to go, although a little frightened



<P>by the impending change.&nbsp; And now she had lived on the river for



<P>three years with a savage mother and a father walking about



<P>amongst pitfalls, with his head in the clouds, weak, irresolute,



<P>and unhappy.&nbsp; She had lived a life devoid of all the decencies

of



<P>civilisation, in miserable domestic conditions; she had breathed



<P>in the atmosphere of sordid plottings for gain, of the no less



<P>disgusting intrigues and crimes for lust or money; and those



<P>things, together with the domestic quarrels, were the only events



<P>of her three years' existence.&nbsp; She did not die from despair and



<P>disgust the first month, as she expected and almost hoped for.



<P>On the contrary, at the end of half a year it had seemed to her



<P>that she had known no other life.&nbsp; Her young mind having been



<P>unskilfully permitted to glance at better things, and then thrown



<P>back again into the hopeless quagmire of barbarism, full of



<P>strong and uncontrolled passions, had lost the power to



<P>discriminate.&nbsp; It seemed to Nina that there was no change and&nbsp;

no



<P>difference.&nbsp; Whether they traded in brick godowns or on the muddy



<P>river bank; whether they reached after much or little; whether



<P>they made love under the shadows of the great trees or in the



<P>shadow of the cathedral on the Singapore promenade; whether they



<P>plotted for their own ends under the protection of laws and



<P>according to the rules of Christian conduct, or whether they



<P>sought the gratification of their desires with the savage cunning



<P>and the unrestrained fierceness of natures as innocent of culture



<P>as their own immense and gloomy forests, Nina saw only the same



<P>manifestations of love and hate and of sordid greed chasing the



<P>uncertain dollar in all its multifarious and vanishing shapes.



<P>To her resolute nature, however, after all these years, the



<P>savage and uncompromising sincerity of purpose shown by her



<P>Malay kinsmen seemed at last preferable to the sleek hypocrisy,



<P>to the polite disguises, to the virtuous pretences of such white



<P>people as she had had the misfortune to come in contact with.



<P>After all it was her life; it was going to be her life, and so



<P>thinking she fell more and more under the influence of her



<P>mother.&nbsp; Seeking, in her ignorance, a better side to that life,



<P>she listened with avidity to the old woman's tales of the



<P>departed glories of the Rajahs, from whose race she had sprung,



<P>and she became gradually more indifferent, more contemptuous of



<P>the white side of her descent represented by a feeble and



<P>traditionless father.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer's difficulties were by no means diminished by the girl's



<P>presence in Sambir.&nbsp; The stir caused by her arrival had died out,



<P>it is true, and Lakamba had not renewed his visits; but about a



<P>year after the departure of the man-of-war boats the nephew of



<P>Abdulla, Syed Reshid, returned from his pilgrimage to Mecca,



<P>rejoicing in a green jacket and the proud title of Hadji.&nbsp; There



<P>was a great letting off of rockets on board the steamer which



<P>brought him in, and a great beating of drums all night in



<P>Abdulla's compound, while the feast of welcome was prolonged far



<P>into the small hours of the morning.&nbsp; Reshid was the favourite



<P>nephew and heir of Abdulla, and that loving uncle, meeting



<P>Almayer one day by the riverside, stopped politely to exchange



<P>civilities and to ask solemnly for an interview.&nbsp; Almayer



<P>suspected some attempt at a swindle, or at any rate something



<P>unpleasant, but of course consented with a great show of



<P>rejoicing.&nbsp; Accordingly the next evening, after sunset, Abdulla



<P>came, accompanied by several other grey-beards and by his nephew.



<P>That young man--of a very rakish and dissipated appearance--



<P>affected the greatest indifference as to the whole of the



<P>proceedings.&nbsp; When the torch-bearers had grouped themselves below



<P>the steps, and the visitors had seated themselves on various lame



<P>chairs, Reshid stood apart in the shadow, examining his



<P>aristocratically small hands with great attention.&nbsp; Almayer,



<P>surprised by the great solemnity of his visitors, perched himself



<P>on the corner of the table with a characteristic want of dignity



<P>quickly noted by the Arabs with grave disapproval.&nbsp; But Abdulla



<P>spoke now, looking straight past Almayer at the red curtain



<P>hanging in the doorway, where a slight tremor disclosed the



<P>presence of women on the other side.&nbsp; He began by neatly



<P>complimenting Almayer upon the long years they had dwelt together



<P>in cordial neighbourhood, and called upon Allah to give him many



<P>more years to gladden the eyes of his friends by his welcome



<P>presence.&nbsp; He made a polite allusion to the great consideration



<P>shown him (Almayer) by the Dutch "Commissie," and drew thence the



<P>flattering inference of Almayer's great importance amongst his



<P>own people.&nbsp; He--Abdulla--was also important amongst all the



<P>Arabs, and his nephew Reshid would be heir of that social



<P>position and of great riches.&nbsp; Now Reshid was a Hadji.&nbsp; He

was



<P>possessor of several Malay women, went on Abdulla, but it was



<P>time he had a favourite wife, the first of the four allowed by



<P>the Prophet.&nbsp; And, speaking with well-bred politeness, he



<P>explained further to the dumbfounded Almayer that, if he would



<P>consent to the alliance of his offspring with that true believer



<P>and virtuous man Reshid, she would be the mistress of all the



<P>splendours of Reshid's house, and first wife of the first Arab in



<P>the Islands, when he--Abdulla--was called to the joys of Paradise



<P>by Allah the All-merciful.&nbsp; "You know, Tuan," he said, in



<P>conclusion, "the other women would be her slaves, and Reshid's



<P>house is great.&nbsp; From Bombay he has brought great divans, and



<P>costly carpets, and European furniture.&nbsp; There is also a great



<P>looking-glass in a frame shining like gold.&nbsp; What could a girl



<P>want more?"&nbsp; And while Almayer looked upon him in silent dismay



<P>Abdulla spoke in a more confidential tone, waving his attendants



<P>away, and finished his speech by pointing out the material



<P>advantages of such an alliance, and offering to settle upon



<P>Almayer three thousand dollars as a sign of his sincere



<P>friendship and the price of the girl.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor Almayer was nearly having a fit.&nbsp; Burning with the desire

of



<P>taking Abdulla by the throat, he had but to think of his helpless



<P>position in the midst of lawless men to comprehend the necessity



<P>of diplomatic conciliation.&nbsp; He mastered his impulses, and spoke



<P>politely and coldly, saying the girl was young and as the apple



<P>of his eye.&nbsp; Tuan Reshid, a Faithful and a Hadji, would not want



<P>an infidel woman in his harem; and, seeing Abdulla smile



<P>sceptically at that last objection, he remained silent, not



<P>trusting himself to speak more, not daring to refuse point-blank,



<P>nor yet to say anything compromising.&nbsp; Abdulla understood the



<P>meaning of that silence, and rose to take leave with a grave



<P>salaam.&nbsp; He wished his friend Almayer "a thousand years," and



<P>moved down the steps, helped dutifully by Reshid.&nbsp; The torch-



<P>bearers shook their torches, scattering a shower of sparks into



<P>the river, and the cortege moved off, leaving Almayer agitated



<P>but greatly relieved by their departure.&nbsp; He dropped into a chair



<P>and watched the glimmer of the lights amongst the tree trunks



<P>till they disappeared and complete silence succeeded the tramp of



<P>feet and the murmur of voices.&nbsp; He did not move till the curtain



<P>rustled and Nina came out on the verandah and sat in the



<P>rocking-chair, where she used to spend many hours every day.&nbsp; She



<P>gave a slight rocking motion to her seat, leaning back with



<P>half-closed eyes, her long hair shading her face from the smoky



<P>light of the lamp on the table.&nbsp; Almayer looked at her furtively,



<P>but the face was as impassible as ever.&nbsp; She turned her head



<P>slightly towards her father, and, speaking, to his great



<P>surprise, in English, asked--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Was that Abdulla here?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Almayer--"just gone."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And what did he want, father?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He wanted to buy you for Reshid," answered Almayer, brutally,



<P>his anger getting the better of him, and looking at the girl as



<P>if in expectation of some outbreak of feeling.&nbsp; But Nina remained



<P>apparently unmoved, gazing dreamily into the black night outside.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Be careful, Nina," said Almayer, after a short silence and



<P>rising from his chair, "when you go paddling alone into the



<P>creeks in your canoe.&nbsp; That Reshid is a violent scoundrel, and



<P>there is no saying what he may do.&nbsp; Do you hear me?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was standing now, ready to go in, one hand grasping the



<P>curtain in the doorway.&nbsp; She turned round, throwing her heavy



<P>tresses back by a sudden gesture.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you think he would dare?" she asked, quickly, and then turned



<P>again to go in, adding in a lower tone, "He would not dare.



<P>Arabs are all cowards."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almayer looked after her, astonished.&nbsp; He did not seek the repose



<P>of his hammock.&nbsp; He walked the floor absently, sometimes stopping



<P>by the balustrade to think.&nbsp; The lamp went out.&nbsp; The first

streak



<P>of dawn broke over the forest; Almayer shivered in the damp air.



<P>"I give it up," he muttered to himself, lying down wearily.



<P>"Damn those women!&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; If the girl did not look as if

she



<P>wanted to be kidnapped!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And he felt a nameless fear creep into his heart, making him



<P>shiver again.
