<B>CHAPTER XVI</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>It was not in Miss Crawford's power to talk Fanny into any



<P>real forgetfulness of what had passed.&nbsp; When the evening



<P>was over, she went to bed full of it, her nerves still



<P>agitated by the shock of such an attack from her cousin Tom,



<P>so public and so persevered in, and her spirits sinking



<P>under her aunt's unkind reflection and reproach.



<P>To be called into notice in such a manner, to hear that it



<P>was but the prelude to something so infinitely worse,



<P>to be told that she must do what was so impossible as to act;



<P>and then to have the charge of obstinacy and ingratitude



<P>follow it, enforced with such a hint at the dependence



<P>of her situation, had been too distressing at the time



<P>to make the remembrance when she was alone much less so,



<P>especially with the superadded dread of what the



<P>morrow might produce in continuation of the subject.



<P>Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time;



<P>and if she were applied to again among themselves with all



<P>the authoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of,



<P>and Edmund perhaps away, what should she do?&nbsp; She fell



<P>asleep before she could answer the question, and found



<P>it quite as puzzling when she awoke the next morning.



<P>The little white attic, which had continued her sleeping-room



<P>ever since her first entering the family, proving incompetent



<P>to suggest any reply, she had recourse, as soon as she



<P>was dressed, to another apartment more spacious and more



<P>meet for walking about in and thinking, and of which she



<P>had now for some time been almost equally mistress.



<P>It had been their school-room; so called till the Miss



<P>Bertrams would not allow it to be called so any longer,



<P>and inhabited as such to a later period.&nbsp; There Miss



<P>Lee had lived, and there they had read and written,



<P>and talked and laughed, till within the last three years,



<P>when she had quitted them.&nbsp; The room had then become useless,



<P>and for some time was quite deserted, except by Fanny,



<P>when she visited her plants, or wanted one of the books,



<P>which she was still glad to keep there, from the deficiency



<P>of space and accommodation in her little chamber above:



<P>but gradually, as her value for the comforts of it increased,



<P>she had added to her possessions, and spent more of her



<P>time there; and having nothing to oppose her, had so



<P>naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it, that it



<P>was now generally admitted to be hers.&nbsp; The East room,



<P>as it had been called ever since Maria Bertram was sixteen,



<P>was now considered Fanny's, almost as decidedly as the



<P>white attic:&nbsp; the smallness of the one making the use of



<P>the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss Bertrams,



<P>with every superiority in their own apartments which their



<P>own sense of superiority could demand, were entirely



<P>approving it; and Mrs. Norris, having stipulated for there



<P>never being a fire in it on Fanny's account, was tolerably



<P>resigned to her having the use of what nobody else wanted,



<P>though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the



<P>indulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in



<P>the house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The aspect was so favourable that even without a fire



<P>it was habitable in many an early spring and late



<P>autumn morning to such a willing mind as Fanny's;



<P>and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not



<P>to be driven from it entirely, even when winter came.



<P>The comfort of it in her hours of leisure was extreme.



<P>She could go there after anything unpleasant below,



<P>and find immediate consolation in some pursuit,



<P>or some train of thought at hand.&nbsp; Her plants, her books--



<P>of which she had been a collector from the first hour



<P>of her commanding a shilling--her writing-desk, and her



<P>works of charity and ingenuity, were all within her reach;



<P>or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing



<P>would do, she could scarcely see an object in that room



<P>which had not an interesting remembrance connected with it.



<P>Everything was a friend, or bore her thoughts to a friend;



<P>and though there had been sometimes much of suffering



<P>to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood,



<P>her feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued;



<P>though she had known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule,



<P>and neglect, yet almost every recurrence of either had led



<P>to something consolatory:&nbsp; her aunt Bertram had spoken



<P>for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what was yet



<P>more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her champion



<P>and her friend:&nbsp; he had supported her cause or explained



<P>her meaning, he had told her not to cry, or had given her



<P>some proof of affection which made her tears delightful;



<P>and the whole was now so blended together, so harmonised



<P>by distance, that every former affliction had its charm.



<P>The room was most dear to her, and she would not have



<P>changed its furniture for the handsomest in the house,



<P>though what had been originally plain had suffered all



<P>the ill-usage of children; and its greatest elegancies



<P>and ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia's work,



<P>too ill done for the drawing-room, three transparencies,



<P>made in a rage for transparencies, for the three lower



<P>panes of one window, where Tintern Abbey held its station



<P>between a cave in Italy and a moonlight lake in Cumberland,



<P>a collection of family profiles, thought unworthy of being



<P>anywhere else, over the mantelpiece, and by their side,



<P>and pinned against the wall, a small sketch of a ship



<P>sent four years ago from the Mediterranean by William,



<P>with H.M.S. Antwerp at the bottom, in letters as tall as the



<P>mainmast.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To this nest of comforts Fanny now walked down to try



<P>its influence on an agitated, doubting spirit, to see



<P>if by looking at Edmund's profile she could catch any of



<P>his counsel, or by giving air to her geraniums she might



<P>inhale a breeze of mental strength herself.&nbsp; But she had



<P>more than fears of her own perseverance to remove:&nbsp; she had



<P>begun to feel undecided as to what she _ought_ _to_ _do_;



<P>and as she walked round the room her doubts were increasing.



<P>Was she _right_ in refusing what was so warmly asked,



<P>so strongly wished for--what might be so essential



<P>to a scheme on which some of those to whom she owed the



<P>greatest complaisance had set their hearts?&nbsp; Was it not



<P>ill-nature, selfishness, and a fear of exposing herself?



<P>And would Edmund's judgment, would his persuasion of Sir



<P>Thomas's disapprobation of the whole, be enough to justify



<P>her in a determined denial in spite of all the rest?



<P>It would be so horrible to her to act that she was inclined



<P>to suspect the truth and purity of her own scruples;



<P>and as she looked around her, the claims of her cousins



<P>to being obliged were strengthened by the sight of



<P>present upon present that she had received from them.



<P>The table between the windows was covered with work-boxes



<P>and netting-boxes which had been given her at different times,



<P>principally by Tom; and she grew bewildered as to the amount



<P>of the debt which all these kind remembrances produced.



<P>A tap at the door roused her in the midst of this attempt



<P>to find her way to her duty, and her gentle "Come in"



<P>was answered by the appearance of one, before whom all her



<P>doubts were wont to be laid.&nbsp; Her eyes brightened at the



<P>sight of Edmund.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Can I speak with you, Fanny, for a few minutes?"



<P>said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, certainly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I want to consult.&nbsp; I want your opinion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My opinion!" she cried, shrinking from such a compliment,



<P>highly as it gratified her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, your advice and opinion.&nbsp; I do not know what to do.



<P>This acting scheme gets worse and worse, you see.



<P>They have chosen almost as bad a play as they could,



<P>and now, to complete the business, are going to ask the



<P>help of a young man very slightly known to any of us.



<P>This is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was



<P>talked about at first.&nbsp; I know no harm of Charles Maddox;



<P>but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being



<P>admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable,



<P>the _more_ than intimacy--the familiarity.&nbsp; I cannot think



<P>of it with any patience; and it does appear to me an evil



<P>of such magnitude as must, _if_ _possible_, be prevented.



<P>Do not you see it in the same light?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; but what can be done?&nbsp; Your brother is so determined."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is but _one_ thing to be done, Fanny.&nbsp; I must



<P>take Anhalt myself.&nbsp; I am well aware that nothing else



<P>will quiet Tom."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny could not answer him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is not at all what I like," he continued.&nbsp; "No man can



<P>like being driven into the _appearance_ of such inconsistency.



<P>After being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning,



<P>there is absurdity in the face of my joining them _now_,



<P>when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect;



<P>but I can think of no other alternative.&nbsp; Can you, Fanny?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," said Fanny slowly, "not immediately, but--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But what?&nbsp; I see your judgment is not with me.&nbsp; Think it



<P>a little over.&nbsp; Perhaps you are not so much aware as I am



<P>of the mischief that _may_, of the unpleasantness that _must_



<P>arise from a young man's being received in this manner:



<P>domesticated among us; authorised to come at all hours,



<P>and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away



<P>all restraints.&nbsp; To think only of the licence which every



<P>rehearsal must tend to create.&nbsp; It is all very bad!



<P>Put yourself in Miss Crawford's place, Fanny.



<P>Consider what it would be to act Amelia with a stranger.



<P>She has a right to be felt for, because she evidently



<P>feels for herself.&nbsp; I heard enough of what she said to you



<P>last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting



<P>with a stranger; and as she probably engaged in the part



<P>with different expectations--perhaps without considering



<P>the subject enough to know what was likely to be--



<P>it would be ungenerous, it would be really wrong to



<P>expose her to it.&nbsp; Her feelings ought to be respected.



<P>Does it not strike you so, Fanny?&nbsp; You hesitate."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am sorry for Miss Crawford; but I am more sorry to see



<P>you drawn in to do what you had resolved against, and what



<P>you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle.



<P>It will be such a triumph to the others!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They will not have much cause of triumph when they



<P>see how infamously I act.&nbsp; But, however, triumph there



<P>certainly will be, and I must brave it.&nbsp; But if I can be



<P>the means of restraining the publicity of the business,



<P>of limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly,



<P>I shall be well repaid.&nbsp; As I am now, I have no influence,



<P>I can do nothing:&nbsp; I have offended them, and they will



<P>not hear me; but when I have put them in good-humour



<P>by this concession, I am not without hopes of persuading



<P>them to confine the representation within a much



<P>smaller circle than they are now in the high road for.



<P>This will be a material gain.&nbsp; My object is to confine



<P>it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants.&nbsp; Will not this be



<P>worth gaining?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, it will be a great point."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But still it has not your approbation.&nbsp; Can you mention



<P>any other measure by which I have a chance of doing



<P>equal good?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I cannot think of anything else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Give me your approbation, then, Fanny.&nbsp; I am not



<P>comfortable without it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, cousin!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you are against me, I ought to distrust myself,



<P>and yet--But it is absolutely impossible to let Tom



<P>go on in this way, riding about the country in quest



<P>of anybody who can be persuaded to act--no matter whom:



<P>the look of a gentleman is to be enough.&nbsp; I thought _you_



<P>would have entered more into Miss Crawford's feelings."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No doubt she will be very glad.&nbsp; It must be a great relief



<P>to her," said Fanny, trying for greater warmth of manner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour



<P>to you last night.&nbsp; It gave her a very strong claim



<P>on my goodwill."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She _was_ very kind, indeed, and I am glad to have her



<P>spared"...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could not finish the generous effusion.&nbsp; Her conscience



<P>stopt her in the middle, but Edmund was satisfied.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall walk down immediately after breakfast," said he,



<P>"and am sure of giving pleasure there.&nbsp; And now, dear Fanny,



<P>I will not interrupt you any longer.&nbsp; You want to be reading.



<P>But I could not be easy till I had spoken to you,



<P>and come to a decision.&nbsp; Sleeping or waking, my head



<P>has been full of this matter all night.&nbsp; It is an evil,



<P>but I am certainly making it less than it might be.



<P>If Tom is up, I shall go to him directly and get it over,



<P>and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high



<P>good-humour at the prospect of acting the fool together



<P>with such unanimity.&nbsp; _You_, in the meanwhile, will be taking



<P>a trip into China, I suppose.&nbsp; How does Lord Macartney



<P>go on?"--opening a volume on the table and then taking up



<P>some others.&nbsp; "And here are Crabbe's Tales, and the Idler,



<P>at hand to relieve you, if you tire of your great book.



<P>I admire your little establishment exceedingly; and as



<P>soon as I am gone, you will empty your head of all this



<P>nonsense of acting, and sit comfortably down to your table.



<P>But do not stay here to be cold."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He went; but there was no reading, no China, no composure



<P>for Fanny.&nbsp; He had told her the most extraordinary,



<P>the most inconceivable, the most unwelcome news;



<P>and she could think of nothing else.&nbsp; To be acting!



<P>After all his objections--objections so just and so public!



<P>After all that she had heard him say, and seen him look,



<P>and known him to be feeling.&nbsp; Could it be possible?



<P>Edmund so inconsistent!&nbsp; Was he not deceiving himself?



<P>Was he not wrong?&nbsp; Alas! it was all Miss Crawford's doing.



<P>She had seen her influence in every speech, and was miserable.



<P>The doubts and alarms as to her own conduct, which had previously



<P>distressed her, and which had all slept while she listened



<P>to him, were become of little consequence now.&nbsp; This deeper



<P>anxiety swallowed them up.&nbsp; Things should take their course;



<P>she cared not how it ended.&nbsp; Her cousins might attack,



<P>but could hardly tease her.&nbsp; She was beyond their reach;



<P>and if at last obliged to yield--no matter--it was all



<P>misery now.

<P><B>CHAPTER II</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The little girl performed her long journey in safety;



<P>and at Northampton was met by Mrs. Norris, who thus



<P>regaled in the credit of being foremost to welcome her,



<P>and in the importance of leading her in to the others,



<P>and recommending her to their kindness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old,



<P>and though there might not be much in her first appearance



<P>to captivate, there was, at least, nothing to disgust



<P>her relations.&nbsp; She was small of her age, with no



<P>glow of complexion, nor any other striking beauty;



<P>exceedingly timid and shy, and shrinking from notice;



<P>but her air, though awkward, was not vulgar, her voice



<P>was sweet, and when she spoke her countenance was pretty.



<P>Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly;



<P>and Sir Thomas, seeing how much she needed encouragement,



<P>tried to be all that was conciliating:&nbsp; but he had



<P>to work against a most untoward gravity of deportment;



<P>and Lady Bertram, without taking half so much trouble,



<P>or speaking one word where he spoke ten, by the mere aid



<P>of a good-humoured smile, became immediately the less awful



<P>character of the two.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The young people were all at home, and sustained their



<P>share in the introduction very well, with much good humour,



<P>and no embarrassment, at least on the part of the sons, who,



<P>at seventeen and sixteen, and tall of their age, had all



<P>the grandeur of men in the eyes of their little cousin.



<P>The two girls were more at a loss from being younger



<P>and in greater awe of their father, who addressed them



<P>on the occasion with rather an injudicious particularity.



<P>But they were too much used to company and praise to have



<P>anything like natural shyness; and their confidence



<P>increasing from their cousin's total want of it,



<P>they were soon able to take a full survey of her face



<P>and her frock in easy indifference.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were a remarkably fine family, the sons very well-looking,



<P>the daughters decidedly handsome, and all of them well-grown



<P>and forward of their age, which produced as striking



<P>a difference between the cousins in person, as education



<P>had given to their address; and no one would have supposed



<P>the girls so nearly of an age as they really were.&nbsp; There were



<P>in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny.



<P>Julia Bertram was only twelve, and Maria but a year older.



<P>The little visitor meanwhile was as unhappy as possible.



<P>Afraid of everybody, ashamed of herself, and longing



<P>for the home she had left, she knew not how to look up,



<P>and could scarcely speak to be heard, or without crying.



<P>Mrs. Norris had been talking to her the whole way from



<P>Northampton of her wonderful good fortune, and the



<P>extraordinary degree of gratitude and good behaviour



<P>which it ought to produce, and her consciousness of



<P>misery was therefore increased by the idea of its being



<P>a wicked thing for her not to be happy.&nbsp; The fatigue,



<P>too, of so long a journey, became soon no trifling evil.



<P>In vain were the well-meant condescensions of Sir Thomas,



<P>and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris



<P>that she would be a good girl; in vain did Lady Bertram



<P>smile and make her sit on the sofa with herself and pug,



<P>and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart towards



<P>giving her comfort; she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls



<P>before tears interrupted her, and sleep seeming to be her



<P>likeliest friend, she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is not a very promising beginning," said Mrs. Norris,



<P>when Fanny had left the room.&nbsp; "After all that I said to her



<P>as we came along, I thought she would have behaved better;



<P>I told her how much might depend upon her acquitting



<P>herself well at first.&nbsp; I wish there may not be a little



<P>sulkiness of temper--her poor mother had a good deal;



<P>but we must make allowances for such a child--and I



<P>do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is



<P>really against her, for, with all its faults, it _was_



<P>her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much she



<P>has changed for the better; but then there is moderation



<P>in all things."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It required a longer time, however, than Mrs. Norris



<P>was inclined to allow, to reconcile Fanny to the novelty



<P>of Mansfield Park, and the separation from everybody



<P>she had been used to.&nbsp; Her feelings were very acute,



<P>and too little understood to be properly attended to.



<P>Nobody meant to be unkind, but nobody put themselves out



<P>of their way to secure her comfort.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The holiday allowed to the Miss Bertrams the next day,



<P>on purpose to afford leisure for getting acquainted with,



<P>and entertaining their young cousin, produced little union.



<P>They could not but hold her cheap on finding that she



<P>had but two sashes, and had never learned French; and when



<P>they perceived her to be little struck with the duet they



<P>were so good as to play, they could do no more than make



<P>her a generous present of some of their least valued toys,



<P>and leave her to herself, while they adjourned to whatever



<P>might be the favourite holiday sport of the moment,



<P>making artificial flowers or wasting gold paper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, whether near or from her cousins, whether in



<P>the schoolroom, the drawing-room, or the shrubbery,



<P>was equally forlorn, finding something to fear in



<P>every person and place.&nbsp; She was disheartened by Lady



<P>Bertram's silence, awed by Sir Thomas's grave looks,



<P>and quite overcome by Mrs. Norris's admonitions.



<P>Her elder cousins mortified her by reflections on her size,



<P>and abashed her by noticing her shyness:&nbsp; Miss Lee



<P>wondered at her ignorance, and the maid-servants sneered



<P>at her clothes; and when to these sorrows was added the idea



<P>of the brothers and sisters among whom she had always



<P>been important as playfellow, instructress, and nurse,



<P>the despondence that sunk her little heart was severe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The grandeur of the house astonished, but could not console her.



<P>The rooms were too large for her to move in with ease:



<P>whatever she touched she expected to injure, and she



<P>crept about in constant terror of something or other;



<P>often retreating towards her own chamber to cry;



<P>and the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room



<P>when she left it at night as seeming so desirably sensible



<P>of her peculiar good fortune, ended every day's sorrows



<P>by sobbing herself to sleep.&nbsp; A week had passed in this way,



<P>and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quiet passive manner,



<P>when she was found one morning by her cousin Edmund,



<P>the youngest of the sons, sitting crying on the attic stairs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear little cousin," said he, with all the gentleness



<P>of an excellent nature, "what can be the matter?"&nbsp; And sitting



<P>down by her, he was at great pains to overcome her shame



<P>in being so surprised, and persuade her to speak openly.



<P>"Was she ill? or was anybody angry with her? or had she



<P>quarrelled with Maria and Julia? or was she puzzled



<P>about anything in her lesson that he could explain?



<P>Did she, in short, want anything he could possibly get her,



<P>or do for her?&nbsp; For a long while no answer could be



<P>obtained beyond a "no, no--not at all--no, thank you";



<P>but he still persevered; and no sooner had he begun to



<P>revert to her own home, than her increased sobs explained



<P>to him where the grievance lay.&nbsp; He tried to console her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are sorry to leave Mama, my dear little Fanny,"



<P>said he, "which shows you to be a very good girl; but you



<P>must remember that you are with relations and friends,



<P>who all love you, and wish to make you happy.&nbsp; Let us walk



<P>out in the park, and you shall tell me all about your



<P>brothers and sisters."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On pursuing the subject, he found that, dear as all



<P>these brothers and sisters generally were, there was one



<P>among them who ran more in her thoughts than the rest.



<P>It was William whom she talked of most, and wanted most



<P>to see.&nbsp; William, the eldest, a year older than herself,



<P>her constant companion and friend; her advocate with her



<P>mother (of whom he was the darling) in every distress.



<P>"William did not like she should come away; he had told



<P>her he should miss her very much indeed."&nbsp; "But William will



<P>write to you, I dare say."&nbsp; "Yes, he had promised he would,



<P>but he had told _her_ to write first."&nbsp; "And when shall



<P>you do it?"&nbsp; She hung her head and answered hesitatingly,



<P>"she did not know; she had not any paper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If that be all your difficulty, I will furnish you



<P>with paper and every other material, and you may write



<P>your letter whenever you choose.&nbsp; Would it make you



<P>happy to write to William?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, very."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then let it be done now.&nbsp; Come with me into the



<P>breakfast-room, we shall find everything there,



<P>and be sure of having the room to ourselves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, cousin, will it go to the post?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, depend upon me it shall:&nbsp; it shall go with the



<P>other letters; and, as your uncle will frank it,



<P>it will cost William nothing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My uncle!" repeated Fanny, with a frightened look.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, when you have written the letter, I will take it



<P>to my father to frank."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny thought it a bold measure, but offered no further



<P>resistance; and they went together into the breakfast-room,



<P>where Edmund prepared her paper, and ruled her lines



<P>with all the goodwill that her brother could himself



<P>have felt, and probably with somewhat more exactness.



<P>He continued with her the whole time of her writing,



<P>to assist her with his penknife or his orthography,



<P>as either were wanted; and added to these attentions,



<P>which she felt very much, a kindness to her brother which



<P>delighted her beyond all the rest.&nbsp; He wrote with his own



<P>hand his love to his cousin William, and sent him half



<P>a guinea under the seal.&nbsp; Fanny's feelings on the occasion



<P>were such as she believed herself incapable of expressing;



<P>but her countenance and a few artless words fully



<P>conveyed all their gratitude and delight, and her cousin



<P>began to find her an interesting object.&nbsp; He talked



<P>to her more, and, from all that she said, was convinced



<P>of her having an affectionate heart, and a strong desire



<P>of doing right; and he could perceive her to be farther



<P>entitled to attention by great sensibility of her situation,



<P>and great timidity.&nbsp; He had never knowingly given her pain,



<P>but he now felt that she required more positive kindness;



<P>and with that view endeavoured, in the first place,



<P>to lessen her fears of them all, and gave her especially



<P>a great deal of good advice as to playing with Maria



<P>and Julia, and being as merry as possible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From this day Fanny grew more comfortable.&nbsp; She felt



<P>that she had a friend, and the kindness of her cousin



<P>Edmund gave her better spirits with everybody else.



<P>The place became less strange, and the people less formidable;



<P>and if there were some amongst them whom she could not



<P>cease to fear, she began at least to know their ways,



<P>and to catch the best manner of conforming to them.



<P>The little rusticities and awkwardnesses which had at



<P>first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all,



<P>and not least of herself, necessarily wore away, and she



<P>was no longer materially afraid to appear before her uncle,



<P>nor did her aunt Norris's voice make her start very much.



<P>To her cousins she became occasionally an acceptable companion.



<P>Though unworthy, from inferiority of age and strength,



<P>to be their constant associate, their pleasures and schemes



<P>were sometimes of a nature to make a third very useful,



<P>especially when that third was of an obliging,



<P>yielding temper; and they could not but own, when their



<P>aunt inquired into her faults, or their brother Edmund



<P>urged her claims to their kindness, that "Fanny was



<P>good-natured enough."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund was uniformly kind himself; and she had nothing



<P>worse to endure on the part of Tom than that sort



<P>of merriment which a young man of seventeen will always



<P>think fair with a child of ten.&nbsp; He was just entering



<P>into life, full of spirits, and with all the liberal



<P>dispositions of an eldest son, who feels born only



<P>for expense and enjoyment.&nbsp; His kindness to his little



<P>cousin was consistent with his situation and rights:



<P>he made her some very pretty presents, and laughed at her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As her appearance and spirits improved, Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris



<P>thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan;



<P>and it was pretty soon decided between them that,



<P>though far from clever, she showed a tractable disposition,



<P>and seemed likely to give them little trouble.&nbsp; A mean



<P>opinion of her abilities was not confined to _them_.



<P>Fanny could read, work, and write, but she had been taught



<P>nothing more; and as her cousins found her ignorant



<P>of many things with which they had been long familiar,



<P>they thought her prodigiously stupid, and for the first



<P>two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh



<P>report of it into the drawing-room. "Dear mama, only think,



<P>my cousin cannot put the map of Europe together--



<P>or my cousin cannot tell the principal rivers in Russia--



<P>or, she never heard of Asia Minor--or she does not know



<P>the difference between water-colours and crayons!--



<P>How strange!--Did you ever hear anything so stupid?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear," their considerate aunt would reply,



<P>"it is very bad, but you must not expect everybody



<P>to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, aunt, she is really so very ignorant!--Do you know,



<P>we asked her last night which way she would go to get



<P>to Ireland; and she said, she should cross to the Isle



<P>of Wight.&nbsp; She thinks of nothing but the Isle of Wight,



<P>and she calls it _the_ _Island_, as if there were no



<P>other island in the world.&nbsp; I am sure I should have been



<P>ashamed of myself, if I had not known better long before I



<P>was so old as she is.&nbsp; I cannot remember the time when I



<P>did not know a great deal that she has not the least



<P>notion of yet.&nbsp; How long ago it is, aunt, since we used



<P>to repeat the chronological order of the kings of England,



<P>with the dates of their accession, and most of the principal



<P>events of their reigns!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," added the other; "and of the Roman emperors



<P>as low as Severus; besides a great deal of the heathen



<P>mythology, and all the metals, semi-metals, planets,



<P>and distinguished philosophers."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very true indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with



<P>wonderful memories, and your poor cousin has probably none



<P>at all.&nbsp; There is a vast deal of difference in memories,



<P>as well as in everything else, and therefore you must



<P>make allowance for your cousin, and pity her deficiency.



<P>And remember that, if you are ever so forward and clever



<P>yourselves, you should always be modest; for, much as you



<P>know already, there is a great deal more for you to learn."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I know there is, till I am seventeen.&nbsp; But I must



<P>tell you another thing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid.



<P>Do you know, she says she does not want to learn either



<P>music or drawing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed,



<P>and shows a great want of genius and emulation.



<P>But, all things considered, I do not know whether it is



<P>not as well that it should be so, for, though you know



<P>(owing to me) your papa and mama are so good as to bring



<P>her up with you, it is not at all necessary that she



<P>should be as accomplished as you are;--on the contrary,



<P>it is much more desirable that there should be a difference."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such were the counsels by which Mrs. Norris assisted to form



<P>her nieces' minds; and it is not very wonderful that,



<P>with all their promising talents and early information,



<P>they should be entirely deficient in the less common



<P>acquirements of self-knowledge, generosity and humility.



<P>In everything but disposition they were admirably taught.



<P>Sir Thomas did not know what was wanting, because, though a



<P>truly anxious father, he was not outwardly affectionate,



<P>and the reserve of his manner repressed all the flow of their



<P>spirits before him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To the education of her daughters Lady Bertram paid not



<P>the smallest attention.&nbsp; She had not time for such cares.



<P>She was a woman who spent her days in sitting, nicely dressed,



<P>on a sofa, doing some long piece of needlework, of little use



<P>and no beauty, thinking more of her pug than her children,



<P>but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put



<P>herself to inconvenience, guided in everything important



<P>by Sir Thomas, and in smaller concerns by her sister.



<P>Had she possessed greater leisure for the service of her girls,



<P>she would probably have supposed it unnecessary, for they



<P>were under the care of a governess, with proper masters,



<P>and could want nothing more.&nbsp; As for Fanny's being stupid



<P>at learning, "she could only say it was very unlucky,



<P>but some people _were_ stupid, and Fanny must take more pains:



<P>she did not know what else was to be done; and, except her



<P>being so dull, she must add she saw no harm in the poor



<P>little thing, and always found her very handy and quick



<P>in carrying messages, and fetching, what she wanted."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, with all her faults of ignorance and timidity,



<P>was fixed at Mansfield Park, and learning to transfer



<P>in its favour much of her attachment to her former home,



<P>grew up there not unhappily among her cousins.&nbsp; There was



<P>no positive ill-nature in Maria or Julia; and though



<P>Fanny was often mortified by their treatment of her,



<P>she thought too lowly of her own claims to feel injured



<P>by it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From about the time of her entering the family,



<P>Lady Bertram, in consequence of a little ill-health,



<P>and a great deal of indolence, gave up the house in town,



<P>which she had been used to occupy every spring,



<P>and remained wholly in the country, leaving Sir Thomas



<P>to attend his duty in Parliament, with whatever increase



<P>or diminution of comfort might arise from her absence.



<P>In the country, therefore, the Miss Bertrams continued



<P>to exercise their memories, practise their duets, and grow



<P>tall and womanly:&nbsp; and their father saw them becoming



<P>in person, manner, and accomplishments, everything that



<P>could satisfy his anxiety.&nbsp; His eldest son was careless



<P>and extravagant, and had already given him much uneasiness;



<P>but his other children promised him nothing but good.



<P>His daughters, he felt, while they retained the name



<P>of Bertram, must be giving it new grace, and in quitting it,



<P>he trusted, would extend its respectable alliances;



<P>and the character of Edmund, his strong good sense



<P>and uprightness of mind, bid most fairly for utility,



<P>honour, and happiness to himself and all his connexions.



<P>He was to be a clergyman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amid the cares and the complacency which his own



<P>children suggested, Sir Thomas did not forget to do what



<P>he could for the children of Mrs. Price:&nbsp; he assisted



<P>her liberally in the education and disposal of her sons



<P>as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit;



<P>and Fanny, though almost totally separated from her family,



<P>was sensible of the truest satisfaction in hearing of any



<P>kindness towards them, or of anything at all promising



<P>in their situation or conduct.&nbsp; Once, and once only,



<P>in the course of many years, had she the happiness



<P>of being with William.&nbsp; Of the rest she saw nothing:



<P>nobody seemed to think of her ever going amongst them again,



<P>even for a visit, nobody at home seemed to want her;



<P>but William determining, soon after her removal,



<P>to be a sailor, was invited to spend a week with his



<P>sister in Northamptonshire before he went to sea.



<P>Their eager affection in meeting, their exquisite



<P>delight in being together, their hours of happy mirth,



<P>and moments of serious conference, may be imagined;



<P>as well as the sanguine views and spirits of the boy even



<P>to the last, and the misery of the girl when he left her.



<P>Luckily the visit happened in the Christmas holidays,



<P>when she could directly look for comfort to her cousin Edmund;



<P>and he told her such charming things of what William was



<P>to do, and be hereafter, in consequence of his profession,



<P>as made her gradually admit that the separation might



<P>have some use.&nbsp; Edmund's friendship never failed her:



<P>his leaving Eton for Oxford made no change in his kind



<P>dispositions, and only afforded more frequent opportunities



<P>of proving them.&nbsp; Without any display of doing more than



<P>the rest, or any fear of doing too much, he was always



<P>true to her interests, and considerate of her feelings,



<P>trying to make her good qualities understood, and to conquer



<P>the diffidence which prevented their being more apparent;



<P>giving her advice, consolation, and encouragement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Kept back as she was by everybody else, his single support



<P>could not bring her forward; but his attentions were otherwise



<P>of the highest importance in assisting the improvement



<P>of her mind, and extending its pleasures.&nbsp; He knew her to



<P>be clever, to have a quick apprehension as well as good sense,



<P>and a fondness for reading, which, properly directed,



<P>must be an education in itself.&nbsp; Miss Lee taught her French,



<P>and heard her read the daily portion of history; but he



<P>recommended the books which charmed her leisure hours,



<P>he encouraged her taste, and corrected her judgment:



<P>he made reading useful by talking to her of what she read,



<P>and heightened its attraction by judicious praise.



<P>In return for such services she loved him better than



<P>anybody in the world except William:&nbsp; her heart was divided



<P>between the two.

<B>CHAPTER III</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The first event of any importance in the family was



<P>the death of Mr. Norris, which happened when Fanny was



<P>about fifteen, and necessarily introduced alterations



<P>and novelties.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris, on quitting the Parsonage,



<P>removed first to the Park, and afterwards to a small house



<P>of Sir Thomas's in the village, and consoled herself



<P>for the loss of her husband by considering that she



<P>could do very well without him; and for her reduction



<P>of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The living was hereafter for Edmund; and, had his uncle



<P>died a few years sooner, it would have been duly given



<P>to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders.



<P>But Tom's extravagance had, previous to that event,



<P>been so great as to render a different disposal of the



<P>next presentation necessary, and the younger brother



<P>must help to pay for the pleasures of the elder.



<P>There was another family living actually held for Edmund;



<P>but though this circumstance had made the arrangement



<P>somewhat easier to Sir Thomas's conscience, he could not



<P>but feel it to be an act of injustice, and he earnestly



<P>tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction,



<P>in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he



<P>had yet been able to say or do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I blush for you, Tom," said he, in his most dignified manner;



<P>"I blush for the expedient which I am driven on, and I trust



<P>I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion.



<P>You have robbed Edmund for ten, twenty, thirty years,



<P>perhaps for life, of more than half the income which ought



<P>to be his.&nbsp; It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours



<P>(I hope it will), to procure him better preferment;



<P>but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that



<P>sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us,



<P>and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalent for the



<P>certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego



<P>through the urgency of your debts."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow;



<P>but escaping as quickly as possible, could soon with



<P>cheerful selfishness reflect, firstly, that he had



<P>not been half so much in debt as some of his friends;



<P>secondly, that his father had made a most tiresome piece



<P>of work of it; and, thirdly, that the future incumbent,



<P>whoever he might be, would, in all probability, die very soon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On Mr. Norris's death the presentation became the right of



<P>a Dr. Grant, who came consequently to reside at Mansfield;



<P>and on proving to be a hearty man of forty-five, seemed



<P>likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram's calculations.



<P>But "no, he was a short-necked, apoplectic sort of fellow,



<P>and, plied well with good things, would soon pop off."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had a wife about fifteen years his junior, but no children;



<P>and they entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair



<P>report of being very respectable, agreeable people.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his



<P>sister-in-law to claim her share in their niece,



<P>the change in Mrs. Norris's situation, and the improvement



<P>in Fanny's age, seeming not merely to do away any former



<P>objection to their living together, but even to give it



<P>the most decided eligibility; and as his own circumstances



<P>were rendered less fair than heretofore, by some recent



<P>losses on his West India estate, in addition to his eldest



<P>son's extravagance, it became not undesirable to himself to be



<P>relieved from the expense of her support, and the obligation



<P>of her future provision.&nbsp; In the fullness of his belief



<P>that such a thing must be, he mentioned its probability



<P>to his wife; and the first time of the subject's occurring



<P>to her again happening to be when Fanny was present,



<P>she calmly observed to her, "So, Fanny, you are going



<P>to leave us, and live with my sister.&nbsp; How shall you like it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat



<P>her aunt's words, "Going to leave you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, my dear; why should you be astonished?



<P>You have been five years with us, and my sister



<P>always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died.



<P>But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected.



<P>She had never received kindness from her aunt Norris,



<P>and could not love her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall be very sorry to go away," said she, with a



<P>faltering voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I dare say you will; _that's_ natural enough.



<P>I suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came



<P>into this house as any creature in the world."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope I am not ungrateful, aunt," said Fanny modestly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, my dear; I hope not.&nbsp; I have always found you



<P>a very good girl."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And am I never to live here again?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Never, my dear; but you are sure of a comfortable home.



<P>It can make very little difference to you, whether you are



<P>in one house or the other."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she could



<P>not feel the difference to be so small, she could not think



<P>of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction.



<P>As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Cousin," said she, "something is going to happen which I



<P>do not like at all; and though you have often persuaded me



<P>into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first,



<P>you will not be able to do it now.&nbsp; I am going to live



<P>entirely with my aunt Norris."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; my aunt Bertram has just told me so.&nbsp; It is quite settled.



<P>I am to leave Mansfield Park, and go to the White House,



<P>I suppose, as soon as she is removed there."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Fanny, and if the plan were not unpleasant to you,



<P>I should call it an excellent one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, cousin!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It has everything else in its favour.&nbsp; My aunt is



<P>acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you.&nbsp; She is



<P>choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought,



<P>and I am glad her love of money does not interfere.



<P>You will be what you ought to be to her.&nbsp; I hope it does



<P>not distress you very much, Fanny?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed it does:&nbsp; I cannot like it.&nbsp; I love this house



<P>and everything in it:&nbsp; I shall love nothing there.



<P>You know how uncomfortable I feel with her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child;



<P>but it was the same with us all, or nearly so.&nbsp; She never



<P>knew how to be pleasant to children.&nbsp; But you are now



<P>of an age to be treated better; I think she is behaving



<P>better already; and when you are her only companion,



<P>you _must_ be important to her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can never be important to any one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is to prevent you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Everything.&nbsp; My situation, my foolishness and awkwardness."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear Fanny,



<P>believe me, you never have a shadow of either, but in using



<P>the words so improperly.&nbsp; There is no reason in the world



<P>why you should not be important where you are known.



<P>You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am sure you



<P>have a grateful heart, that could never receive kindness



<P>without wishing to return it.&nbsp; I do not know any better



<P>qualifications for a friend and companion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are too kind," said Fanny, colouring at such praise;



<P>"how shall I ever thank you as I ought, for thinking



<P>so well of me.&nbsp; Oh! cousin, if I am to go away, I shall



<P>remember your goodness to the last moment of my life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, indeed, Fanny, I should hope to be remembered at



<P>such a distance as the White House.&nbsp; You speak as if you



<P>were going two hundred miles off instead of only across



<P>the park; but you will belong to us almost as much as ever.



<P>The two families will be meeting every day in the year.



<P>The only difference will be that, living with your aunt,



<P>you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be.



<P>Here there are too many whom you can hide behind; but with



<P>her you will be forced to speak for yourself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!&nbsp; I do not say so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I must say it, and say it with pleasure.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris



<P>is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge



<P>of you now.&nbsp; She is of a temper to do a great deal



<P>for anybody she really interests herself about, and she



<P>will force you to do justice to your natural powers."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny sighed, and said, "I cannot see things as you do;



<P>but I ought to believe you to be right rather than myself,



<P>and I am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile



<P>me to what must be.&nbsp; If I could suppose my aunt really



<P>to care for me, it would be delightful to feel myself



<P>of consequence to anybody.&nbsp; _ Here_, I know, I am of none,



<P>and yet I love the place so well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though you



<P>quit the house.&nbsp; You will have as free a command of the



<P>park and gardens as ever.&nbsp; Even _your_ constant little



<P>heart need not take fright at such a nominal change.



<P>You will have the same walks to frequent, the same library



<P>to choose from, the same people to look at, the same horse



<P>to ride."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very true.&nbsp; Yes, dear old grey pony!&nbsp; Ah! cousin, when I



<P>remember how much I used to dread riding, what terrors



<P>it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good



<P>(oh! how I have trembled at my uncle's opening his lips



<P>if horses were talked of), and then think of the kind



<P>pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears,



<P>and convince me that I should like it after a little while,



<P>and feel how right you proved to be, I am inclined to hope



<P>you may always prophesy as well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris



<P>will be as good for your mind as riding has been for



<P>your health, and as much for your ultimate happiness too."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So ended their discourse, which, for any very appropriate



<P>service it could render Fanny, might as well have been spared,



<P>for Mrs. Norris had not the smallest intention of taking her.



<P>It had never occurred to her, on the present occasion,



<P>but as a thing to be carefully avoided.&nbsp; To prevent its



<P>being expected, she had fixed on the smallest habitation



<P>which could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield



<P>parish, the White House being only just large enough to



<P>receive herself and her servants, and allow a spare room



<P>for a friend, of which she made a very particular point.



<P>The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been wanted,



<P>but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend



<P>was now never forgotten.&nbsp; Not all her precautions, however,



<P>could save her from being suspected of something better;



<P>or, perhaps, her very display of the importance of a



<P>spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose it



<P>really intended for Fanny.&nbsp; Lady Bertram soon brought



<P>the matter to a certainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think, sister, we need not keep Miss Lee any longer,



<P>when Fanny goes to live with you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris almost started.&nbsp; "Live with me, dear Lady



<P>Bertram! what do you mean?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is she not to live with you?&nbsp; I thought you had settled



<P>it with Sir Thomas."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me! never.&nbsp; I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas,



<P>nor he to me.&nbsp; Fanny live with me! the last thing in the



<P>world for me to think of, or for anybody to wish that really



<P>knows us both.&nbsp; Good heaven! what could I do with Fanny?



<P>Me! a poor, helpless, forlorn widow, unfit for anything,



<P>my spirits quite broke down; what could I do with a girl



<P>at her time of life?&nbsp; A girl of fifteen! the very age



<P>of all others to need most attention and care, and put



<P>the cheerfullest spirits to the test!&nbsp; Sure Sir Thomas



<P>could not seriously expect such a thing!&nbsp; Sir Thomas is too



<P>much my friend.&nbsp; Nobody that wishes me well, I am sure,



<P>would propose it.&nbsp; How came Sir Thomas to speak to you



<P>about it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed, I do not know.&nbsp; I suppose he thought it best."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But what did he say?&nbsp; He could not say he _wished_ me



<P>to take Fanny.&nbsp; I am sure in his heart he could not wish



<P>me to do it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No; he only said he thought it very likely; and I thought



<P>so too.&nbsp; We both thought it would be a comfort to you.



<P>But if you do not like it, there is no more to be said.



<P>She is no encumbrance here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear sister, if you consider my unhappy state, how can she



<P>be any comfort to me?&nbsp; Here am I, a poor desolate widow,



<P>deprived of the best of husbands, my health gone in attending



<P>and nursing him, my spirits still worse, all my peace



<P>in this world destroyed, with hardly enough to support



<P>me in the rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live



<P>so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed--



<P>what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge



<P>upon me as Fanny?&nbsp; If I could wish it for my own sake,



<P>I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl.



<P>She is in good hands, and sure of doing well.&nbsp; I must



<P>struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as I can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Lady Bertram, I do not complain.&nbsp; I know I cannot



<P>live as I have done, but I must retrench where I can,



<P>and learn to be a better manager.&nbsp; I _have_ _been_



<P>a liberal housekeeper enough, but I shall not be ashamed



<P>to practise economy now.&nbsp; My situation is as much



<P>altered as my income.&nbsp; A great many things were due



<P>from poor Mr. Norris, as clergyman of the parish,



<P>that cannot be expected from me.&nbsp; It is unknown how much



<P>was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers.



<P>At the White House, matters must be better looked after.



<P>I _must_ live within my income, or I shall be miserable;



<P>and I own it would give me great satisfaction to be able



<P>to do rather more, to lay by a little at the end of



<P>the year."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dare say you will.&nbsp; You always do, don't you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My object, Lady Bertram, is to be of use to those that



<P>come after me.&nbsp; It is for your children's good that I



<P>wish to be richer.&nbsp; I have nobody else to care for,



<P>but I should be very glad to think I could leave a little



<P>trifle among them worth their having."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are very good, but do not trouble yourself about them.



<P>They are sure of being well provided for.&nbsp; Sir Thomas



<P>will take care of that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, you know, Sir Thomas's means will be rather straitened



<P>if the Antigua estate is to make such poor returns."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! _that_ will soon be settled.&nbsp; Sir Thomas has been



<P>writing about it, I know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Lady Bertram," said Mrs. Norris, moving to go,



<P>"I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use



<P>to your family:&nbsp; and so, if Sir Thomas should ever speak



<P>again about my taking Fanny, you will be able to say that



<P>my health and spirits put it quite out of the question;



<P>besides that, I really should not have a bed to give her,



<P>for I must keep a spare room for a friend."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation



<P>to her husband to convince him how much he had mistaken



<P>his sister-in-law's views; and she was from that moment



<P>perfectly safe from all expectation, or the slightest



<P>allusion to it from him.&nbsp; He could not but wonder at her



<P>refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so



<P>forward to adopt; but, as she took early care to make him,



<P>as well as Lady Bertram, understand that whatever she



<P>possessed was designed for their family, he soon grew



<P>reconciled to a distinction which, at the same time



<P>that it was advantageous and complimentary to them,



<P>would enable him better to provide for Fanny himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal;



<P>and her spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery,



<P>conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment



<P>in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable



<P>to her.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris took possession of the White House,



<P>the Grants arrived at the Parsonage, and these events over,



<P>everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable,



<P>gave great satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance.



<P>They had their faults, and Mrs. Norris soon found them out.



<P>The Doctor was very fond of eating, and would have a good



<P>dinner every day; and Mrs. Grant, instead of contriving



<P>to gratify him at little expense, gave her cook as high



<P>wages as they did at Mansfield Park, and was scarcely ever



<P>seen in her offices.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris could not speak with any



<P>temper of such grievances, nor of the quantity of butter



<P>and eggs that were regularly consumed in the house.



<P>"Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself;



<P>nobody more hated pitiful doings; the Parsonage,



<P>she believed, had never been wanting in comforts of any sort,



<P>had never borne a bad character in _her_ _time_, but this



<P>was a way of going on that she could not understand.



<P>A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place.



<P>_Her_ store-room, she thought, might have been good enough



<P>for Mrs. Grant to go into.&nbsp; Inquire where she would,



<P>she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more



<P>than five thousand pounds."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Bertram listened without much interest to this



<P>sort of invective.&nbsp; She could not enter into the wrongs



<P>of an economist, but she felt all the injuries of beauty



<P>in Mrs. Grant's being so well settled in life without



<P>being handsome, and expressed her astonishment on



<P>that point almost as often, though not so diffusely,



<P>as Mrs. Norris discussed the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before



<P>another event arose of such importance in the family,



<P>as might fairly claim some place in the thoughts and



<P>conversation of the ladies.&nbsp; Sir Thomas found it expedient



<P>to go to Antigua himself, for the better arrangement



<P>of his affairs, and he took his eldest son with him,



<P>in the hope of detaching him from some bad connexions



<P>at home.&nbsp; They left England with the probability of being



<P>nearly a twelvemonth absent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light,



<P>and the hope of its utility to his son, reconciled Sir



<P>Thomas to the effort of quitting the rest of his family,



<P>and of leaving his daughters to the direction of others



<P>at their present most interesting time of life.



<P>He could not think Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his



<P>place with them, or rather, to perform what should have



<P>been her own; but, in Mrs. Norris's watchful attention,



<P>and in Edmund's judgment, he had sufficient confidence



<P>to make him go without fears for their conduct.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her;



<P>but she was not disturbed by any alarm for his safety,



<P>or solicitude for his comfort, being one of those persons



<P>who think nothing can be dangerous, or difficult,



<P>or fatiguing to anybody but themselves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Miss Bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion:



<P>not for their sorrow, but for their want of it.



<P>Their father was no object of love to them; he had never



<P>seemed the friend of their pleasures, and his absence



<P>was unhappily most welcome.&nbsp; They were relieved by it from



<P>all restraint; and without aiming at one gratification



<P>that would probably have been forbidden by Sir Thomas,



<P>they felt themselves immediately at their own disposal,



<P>and to have every indulgence within their reach.



<P>Fanny's relief, and her consciousness of it, were quite



<P>equal to her cousins'; but a more tender nature suggested



<P>that her feelings were ungrateful, and she really



<P>grieved because she could not grieve.&nbsp; "Sir Thomas,



<P>who had done so much for her and her brothers, and who was



<P>gone perhaps never to return! that she should see him



<P>go without a tear! it was a shameful insensibility."



<P>He had said to her, moreover, on the very last morning,



<P>that he hoped she might see William again in the course



<P>of the ensuing winter, and had charged her to write



<P>and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron



<P>to which he belonged should be known to be in England.



<P>"This was so thoughtful and kind!" and would he only



<P>have smiled upon her, and called her "my dear Fanny,"



<P>while he said it, every former frown or cold address



<P>might have been forgotten.&nbsp; But he had ended his speech



<P>in a way to sink her in sad mortification, by adding,



<P>"If William does come to Mansfield, I hope you may be able



<P>to convince him that the many years which have passed



<P>since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely



<P>without improvement; though, I fear, he must find his sister



<P>at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten."



<P>She cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle



<P>was gone; and her cousins, on seeing her with red eyes,



<P>set her down as a hypocrite.

<B>CHAPTER XVII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>It was, indeed, a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria.



<P>Such a victory over Edmund's discretion had been beyond



<P>their hopes, and was most delightful.&nbsp; There was no



<P>longer anything to disturb them in their darling project,



<P>and they congratulated each other in private on the



<P>jealous weakness to which they attributed the change,



<P>with all the glee of feelings gratified in every way.



<P>Edmund might still look grave, and say he did not like the



<P>scheme in general, and must disapprove the play in particular;



<P>their point was gained:&nbsp; he was to act, and he was



<P>driven to it by the force of selfish inclinations only.



<P>Edmund had descended from that moral elevation which he



<P>had maintained before, and they were both as much the better



<P>as the happier for the descent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They behaved very well, however, to _him_ on the occasion,



<P>betraying no exultation beyond the lines about the corners



<P>of the mouth, and seemed to think it as great an escape



<P>to be quit of the intrusion of Charles Maddox, as if they



<P>had been forced into admitting him against their inclination.



<P>"To have it quite in their own family circle was what



<P>they had particularly wished.&nbsp; A stranger among them



<P>would have been the destruction of all their comfort";



<P>and when Edmund, pursuing that idea, gave a hint of his hope



<P>as to the limitation of the audience, they were ready,



<P>in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything.



<P>It was all good-humour and encouragement.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris



<P>offered to contrive his dress, Mr. Yates assured him



<P>that Anhalt's last scene with the Baron admitted a good



<P>deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. Rushworth undertook



<P>to count his speeches.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps," said Tom, "Fanny may be more disposed to oblige



<P>us now.&nbsp; Perhaps you may persuade _her_."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, she is quite determined.&nbsp; She certainly will not act."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! very well."&nbsp; And not another word was said; but Fanny



<P>felt herself again in danger, and her indifference



<P>to the danger was beginning to fail her already.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park



<P>on this change in Edmund; Miss Crawford looked very lovely



<P>in hers, and entered with such an instantaneous renewal



<P>of cheerfulness into the whole affair as could have but



<P>one effect on him.&nbsp; "He was certainly right in respecting



<P>such feelings; he was glad he had determined on it."



<P>And the morning wore away in satisfactions very sweet,



<P>if not very sound.&nbsp; One advantage resulted from it



<P>to Fanny:&nbsp; at the earnest request of Miss Crawford,



<P>Mrs. Grant had, with her usual good-humour, agreed



<P>to undertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted;



<P>and this was all that occurred to gladden _her_ heart



<P>during the day; and even this, when imparted by Edmund,



<P>brought a pang with it, for it was Miss Crawford to



<P>whom she was obliged--it was Miss Crawford whose kind



<P>exertions were to excite her gratitude, and whose merit



<P>in making them was spoken of with a glow of admiration.



<P>She was safe; but peace and safety were unconnected here.



<P>Her mind had been never farther from peace.&nbsp; She could



<P>not feel that she had done wrong herself, but she was



<P>disquieted in every other way.&nbsp; Her heart and her judgment



<P>were equally against Edmund's decision:&nbsp; she could not



<P>acquit his unsteadiness, and his happiness under it made



<P>her wretched.&nbsp; She was full of jealousy and agitation.



<P>Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which seemed



<P>an insult, with friendly expressions towards herself



<P>which she could hardly answer calmly.&nbsp; Everybody around



<P>her was gay and busy, prosperous and important; each had



<P>their object of interest, their part, their dress,



<P>their favourite scene, their friends and confederates:



<P>all were finding employment in consultations and comparisons,



<P>or diversion in the playful conceits they suggested.



<P>She alone was sad and insignificant:&nbsp; she had no share



<P>in anything; she might go or stay; she might be in the



<P>midst of their noise, or retreat from it to the solitude



<P>of the East room, without being seen or missed.&nbsp; She could



<P>almost think anything would have been preferable to this.



<P>Mrs. Grant was of consequence:&nbsp; _her_ good-nature had



<P>honourable mention; her taste and her time were considered;



<P>her presence was wanted; she was sought for, and attended,



<P>and praised; and Fanny was at first in some danger



<P>of envying her the character she had accepted.



<P>But reflection brought better feelings, and shewed her



<P>that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect, which could never



<P>have belonged to _her_; and that, had she received even



<P>the greatest, she could never have been easy in joining



<P>a scheme which, considering only her uncle, she must



<P>condemn altogether.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's heart was not absolutely the only saddened one



<P>amongst them, as she soon began to acknowledge to herself.



<P>Julia was a sufferer too, though not quite so blamelessly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Henry Crawford had trifled with her feelings; but she



<P>had very long allowed and even sought his attentions,



<P>with a jealousy of her sister so reasonable as ought



<P>to have been their cure; and now that the conviction



<P>of his preference for Maria had been forced on her,



<P>she submitted to it without any alarm for Maria's situation,



<P>or any endeavour at rational tranquillity for herself.



<P>She either sat in gloomy silence, wrapt in such gravity



<P>as nothing could subdue, no curiosity touch, no wit amuse;



<P>or allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates, was talking with



<P>forced gaiety to him alone, and ridiculing the acting of



<P>the others.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For a day or two after the affront was given,



<P>Henry Crawford had endeavoured to do it away by the usual



<P>attack of gallantry and compliment, but he had not cared



<P>enough about it to persevere against a few repulses;



<P>and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time



<P>for more than one flirtation, he grew indifferent to



<P>the quarrel, or rather thought it a lucky occurrence,



<P>as quietly putting an end to what might ere long



<P>have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant.



<P>She was not pleased to see Julia excluded from the play,



<P>and sitting by disregarded; but as it was not a matter



<P>which really involved her happiness, as Henry must be the



<P>best judge of his own, and as he did assure her, with a



<P>most persuasive smile, that neither he nor Julia had ever



<P>had a serious thought of each other, she could only renew



<P>her former caution as to the elder sister, entreat him



<P>not to risk his tranquillity by too much admiration there,



<P>and then gladly take her share in anything that brought



<P>cheerfulness to the young people in general, and that did



<P>so particularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry,"



<P>was her observation to Mary.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dare say she is," replied Mary coldly.&nbsp; "I imagine



<P>both sisters are."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Both! no, no, that must not be.&nbsp; Do not give him a hint



<P>of it.&nbsp; Think of Mr. Rushworth!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth.



<P>It may do _her_ some good.&nbsp; I often think of Mr. Rushworth's



<P>property and independence, and wish them in other hands;



<P>but I never think of him.&nbsp; A man might represent the county



<P>with such an estate; a man might escape a profession



<P>and represent the county."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dare say he _will_ be in parliament soon.&nbsp; When Sir



<P>Thomas comes, I dare say he will be in for some borough,



<P>but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing



<P>anything yet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he



<P>comes home," said Mary, after a pause.&nbsp; "Do you remember



<P>Hawkins Browne's 'Address to Tobacco,' in imitation



<P>of Pope?--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blest leaf! whose aromatic gales dispense



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Templars modesty, to Parsons sense.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I will parody them--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blest Knight! whose dictatorial looks dispense



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Children affluence, to Rushworth sense.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Will not that do, Mrs. Grant?&nbsp; Everything seems to depend



<P>upon Sir Thomas's return."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will find his consequence very just and reasonable



<P>when you see him in his family, I assure you.&nbsp; I do not think



<P>we do so well without him.&nbsp; He has a fine dignified manner,



<P>which suits the head of such a house, and keeps everybody



<P>in their place.&nbsp; Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher



<P>now than when he is at home; and nobody else can keep



<P>Mrs. Norris in order.&nbsp; But, Mary, do not fancy that Maria



<P>Bertram cares for Henry.&nbsp; I am sure _Julia_ does not,



<P>or she would not have flirted as she did last night with



<P>Mr. Yates; and though he and Maria are very good friends,



<P>I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth's chance if Henry



<P>stept in before the articles were signed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you have such a suspicion, something must be done;



<P>and as soon as the play is all over, we will talk to him



<P>seriously and make him know his own mind; and if he



<P>means nothing, we will send him off, though he is Henry,



<P>for a time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Julia _did_ suffer, however, though Mrs. Grant discerned



<P>it not, and though it escaped the notice of many of her



<P>own family likewise.&nbsp; She had loved, she did love still,



<P>and she had all the suffering which a warm temper and a



<P>high spirit were likely to endure under the disappointment



<P>of a dear, though irrational hope, with a strong sense



<P>of ill-usage. Her heart was sore and angry, and she



<P>was capable only of angry consolations.&nbsp; The sister



<P>with whom she was used to be on easy terms was now become



<P>her greatest enemy:&nbsp; they were alienated from each other;



<P>and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing



<P>end to the attentions which were still carrying on there,



<P>some punishment to Maria for conduct so shameful towards



<P>herself as well as towards Mr. Rushworth.&nbsp; With no material



<P>fault of temper, or difference of opinion, to prevent



<P>their being very good friends while their interests



<P>were the same, the sisters, under such a trial as this,



<P>had not affection or principle enough to make them merciful



<P>or just, to give them honour or compassion.&nbsp; Maria felt



<P>her triumph, and pursued her purpose, careless of Julia;



<P>and Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry



<P>Crawford without trusting that it would create jealousy,



<P>and bring a public disturbance at last.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny saw and pitied much of this in Julia; but there



<P>was no outward fellowship between them.&nbsp; Julia made



<P>no communication, and Fanny took no liberties.&nbsp; They were



<P>two solitary sufferers, or connected only by Fanny's consciousness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The inattention of the two brothers and the aunt to



<P>Julia's discomposure, and their blindness to its true cause,



<P>must be imputed to the fullness of their own minds.



<P>They were totally preoccupied.&nbsp; Tom was engrossed by



<P>the concerns of his theatre, and saw nothing that did



<P>not immediately relate to it.&nbsp; Edmund, between his



<P>theatrical and his real part, between Miss Crawford's



<P>claims and his own conduct, between love and consistency,



<P>was equally unobservant; and Mrs. Norris was too busy



<P>in contriving and directing the general little matters



<P>of the company, superintending their various dresses



<P>with economical expedient, for which nobody thanked her,



<P>and saving, with delighted integrity, half a crown here and



<P>there to the absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure for watching



<P>the behaviour, or guarding the happiness of his daughters.

<P><B>CHAPTER I</B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>About thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon,



<P>with only seven thousand pounds, had the good luck



<P>to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, of Mansfield Park,



<P>in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raised



<P>to the rank of a baronet's lady, with all the comforts



<P>and consequences of an handsome house and large income.



<P>All Huntingdon exclaimed on the greatness of the match,



<P>and her uncle, the lawyer, himself, allowed her to be at least



<P>three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it.



<P>She had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation;



<P>and such of their acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss



<P>Frances quite as handsome as Miss Maria, did not scruple



<P>to predict their marrying with almost equal advantage.



<P>But there certainly are not so many men of large fortune



<P>in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them.



<P>Miss Ward, at the end of half a dozen years, found



<P>herself obliged to be attached to the Rev. Mr. Norris,



<P>a friend of her brother-in-law, with scarcely any



<P>private fortune, and Miss Frances fared yet worse.



<P>Miss Ward's match, indeed, when it came to the point,



<P>was not contemptible:&nbsp; Sir Thomas being happily able



<P>to give his friend an income in the living of Mansfield;



<P>and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their career of conjugal



<P>felicity with very little less than a thousand a year.



<P>But Miss Frances married, in the common phrase,



<P>to disoblige her family, and by fixing on a lieutenant



<P>of marines, without education, fortune, or connexions,



<P>did it very thoroughly.&nbsp; She could hardly have made



<P>a more untoward choice.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Bertram had interest,



<P>which, from principle as well as pride--from a general



<P>wish of doing right, and a desire of seeing all that were



<P>connected with him in situations of respectability,



<P>he would have been glad to exert for the advantage



<P>of Lady Bertram's sister; but her husband's profession



<P>was such as no interest could reach; and before he



<P>had time to devise any other method of assisting them,



<P>an absolute breach between the sisters had taken place.



<P>It was the natural result of the conduct of each party,



<P>and such as a very imprudent marriage almost always produces.



<P>To save herself from useless remonstrance, Mrs. Price never



<P>wrote to her family on the subject till actually married.



<P>Lady Bertram, who was a woman of very tranquil feelings,



<P>and a temper remarkably easy and indolent, would have



<P>contented herself with merely giving up her sister,



<P>and thinking no more of the matter; but Mrs. Norris



<P>had a spirit of activity, which could not be satisfied



<P>till she had written a long and angry letter to Fanny,



<P>to point out the folly of her conduct, and threaten



<P>her with all its possible ill consequences.&nbsp; Mrs. Price,



<P>in her turn, was injured and angry; and an answer,



<P>which comprehended each sister in its bitterness, and bestowed



<P>such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir



<P>Thomas as Mrs. Norris could not possibly keep to herself,



<P>put an end to all intercourse between them for a considerable



<P>period.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their homes were so distant, and the circles in which they



<P>moved so distinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever



<P>hearing of each other's existence during the eleven



<P>following years, or, at least, to make it very wonderful



<P>to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have it



<P>in her power to tell them, as she now and then did,



<P>in an angry voice, that Fanny had got another child.



<P>By the end of eleven years, however, Mrs. Price could no



<P>longer afford to cherish pride or resentment, or to lose one



<P>connexion that might possibly assist her.&nbsp; A large and still



<P>increasing family, an husband disabled for active service,



<P>but not the less equal to company and good liquor, and a



<P>very small income to supply their wants, made her eager



<P>to regain the friends she had so carelessly sacrificed;



<P>and she addressed Lady Bertram in a letter which spoke



<P>so much contrition and despondence, such a superfluity



<P>of children, and such a want of almost everything else,



<P>as could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation.



<P>She was preparing for her ninth lying-in; and after



<P>bewailing the circumstance, and imploring their countenance



<P>as sponsors to the expected child, she could not conceal



<P>how important she felt they might be to the future



<P>maintenance of the eight already in being.&nbsp; Her eldest



<P>was a boy of ten years old, a fine spirited fellow,



<P>who longed to be out in the world; but what could she do?



<P>Was there any chance of his being hereafter useful to Sir



<P>Thomas in the concerns of his West Indian property?



<P>No situation would be beneath him; or what did Sir Thomas



<P>think of Woolwich? or how could a boy be sent out to



<P>the East?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The letter was not unproductive.&nbsp; It re-established



<P>peace and kindness.&nbsp; Sir Thomas sent friendly



<P>advice and professions, Lady Bertram dispatched



<P>money and baby-linen, and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such were its immediate effects, and within a twelvemonth



<P>a more important advantage to Mrs. Price resulted from it.



<P>Mrs. Norris was often observing to the others that she



<P>could not get her poor sister and her family out of



<P>her head, and that, much as they had all done for her,



<P>she seemed to be wanting to do more; and at length she



<P>could not but own it to be her wish that poor Mrs. Price



<P>should be relieved from the charge and expense of one child



<P>entirely out of her great number.&nbsp; "What if they were



<P>among them to undertake the care of her eldest daughter,



<P>a girl now nine years old, of an age to require more



<P>attention than her poor mother could possibly give?



<P>The trouble and expense of it to them would be nothing,



<P>compared with the benevolence of the action."&nbsp; Lady Bertram



<P>agreed with her instantly.&nbsp; "I think we cannot do better,"



<P>said she; "let us send for the child."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified



<P>a consent.&nbsp; He debated and hesitated;--it was a serious charge;--



<P>a girl so brought up must be adequately provided for,



<P>or there would be cruelty instead of kindness in taking



<P>her from her family.&nbsp; He thought of his own four children,



<P>of his two sons, of cousins in love, etc.;--but no sooner



<P>had he deliberately begun to state his objections,



<P>than Mrs. Norris interrupted him with a reply to them all,



<P>whether stated or not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do



<P>justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions,



<P>which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct;



<P>and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety



<P>of doing everything one could by way of providing for a



<P>child one had in a manner taken into one's own hands;



<P>and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to



<P>withhold my mite upon such an occasion.&nbsp; Having no children



<P>of my own, who should I look to in any little matter I



<P>may ever have to bestow, but the children of my sisters?--



<P>and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just--but you know I am



<P>a woman of few words and professions.&nbsp; Do not let us



<P>be frightened from a good deed by a trifle.&nbsp; Give a girl



<P>an education, and introduce her properly into the world,



<P>and ten to one but she has the means of settling well,



<P>without farther expense to anybody.&nbsp; A niece of ours,



<P>Sir Thomas, I may say, or at least of_yours_, would not



<P>grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages.



<P>I don't say she would be so handsome as her cousins.



<P>I dare say she would not; but she would be introduced into



<P>the society of this country under such very favourable



<P>circumstances as, in all human probability, would get her



<P>a creditable establishment.&nbsp; You are thinking of your sons--



<P>but do not you know that, of all things upon earth,



<P>_that_ is the least likely to happen, brought up as they



<P>would be, always together like brothers and sisters?



<P>It is morally impossible.&nbsp; I never knew an instance of it.



<P>It is, in fact, the only sure way of providing against



<P>the connexion.&nbsp; Suppose her a pretty girl, and seen by Tom



<P>or Edmund for the first time seven years hence, and I dare



<P>say there would be mischief.&nbsp; The very idea of her having



<P>been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty



<P>and neglect, would be enough to make either of the dear,



<P>sweet-tempered boys in love with her.&nbsp; But breed her up



<P>with them from this time, and suppose her even to have the



<P>beauty of an angel, and she will never be more to either than



<P>a sister."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is a great deal of truth in what you say,"



<P>replied Sir Thomas, "and far be it from me to throw any



<P>fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be



<P>so consistent with the relative situations of each.&nbsp; I only



<P>meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in,



<P>and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price,



<P>and creditable to ourselves, we must secure to the child,



<P>or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter,



<P>as circumstances may arise, the provision of a gentlewoman,



<P>if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine



<P>in expecting."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thoroughly understand you," cried Mrs. Norris,



<P>"you are everything that is generous and considerate,



<P>and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point.



<P>Whatever I can do, as you well know, I am always ready



<P>enough to do for the good of those I love; and, though I



<P>could never feel for this little girl the hundredth



<P>part of the regard I bear your own dear children,



<P>nor consider her, in any respect, so much my own,



<P>I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her.



<P>Is not she a sister's child? and could I bear to see



<P>her want while I had a bit of bread to give her?



<P>My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warm heart;



<P>and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries



<P>of life than do an ungenerous thing.&nbsp; So, if you are not



<P>against it, I will write to my poor sister tomorrow,



<P>and make the proposal; and, as soon as matters are settled,



<P>_I_ will engage to get the child to Mansfield; _you_ shall



<P>have no trouble about it.&nbsp; My own trouble, you know,



<P>I never regard.&nbsp; I will send Nanny to London on purpose,



<P>and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler's, and the



<P>child be appointed to meet her there.&nbsp; They may easily get



<P>her from Portsmouth to town by the coach, under the care



<P>of any creditable person that may chance to be going.



<P>I dare say there is always some reputable tradesman's wife



<P>or other going up."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Except to the attack on Nanny's cousin, Sir Thomas no longer



<P>made any objection, and a more respectable, though less



<P>economical rendezvous being accordingly substituted,



<P>everything was considered as settled, and the pleasures



<P>of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed.



<P>The division of gratifying sensations ought not,



<P>in strict justice, to have been equal; for Sir Thomas was



<P>fully resolved to be the real and consistent patron of the



<P>selected child, and Mrs. Norris had not the least intention



<P>of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance.



<P>As far as walking, talking, and contriving reached,



<P>she was thoroughly benevolent, and nobody knew better



<P>how to dictate liberality to others; but her love of money



<P>was equal to her love of directing, and she knew quite as



<P>well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends.



<P>Having married on a narrower income than she had been



<P>used to look forward to, she had, from the first,



<P>fancied a very strict line of economy necessary;



<P>and what was begun as a matter of prudence, soon grew



<P>into a matter of choice, as an object of that needful



<P>solicitude which there were no children to supply.



<P>Had there been a family to provide for, Mrs. Norris might



<P>never have saved her money; but having no care of that kind,



<P>there was nothing to impede her frugality, or lessen the



<P>comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they



<P>had never lived up to.&nbsp; Under this infatuating principle,



<P>counteracted by no real affection for her sister,



<P>it was impossible for her to aim at more than the credit



<P>of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity;



<P>though perhaps she might so little know herself as to



<P>walk home to the Parsonage, after this conversation,



<P>in the happy belief of being the most liberal-minded



<P>sister and aunt in the world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the subject was brought forward again, her views



<P>were more fully explained; and, in reply to Lady Bertram's



<P>calm inquiry of "Where shall the child come to first,



<P>sister, to you or to us?"&nbsp; Sir Thomas heard with some



<P>surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris's



<P>power to take any share in the personal charge of her.



<P>He had been considering her as a particularly welcome



<P>addition at the Parsonage, as a desirable companion



<P>to an aunt who had no children of her own; but he found



<P>himself wholly mistaken.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris was sorry to say



<P>that the little girl's staying with them, at least



<P>as things then were, was quite out of the question.



<P>Poor Mr. Norris's indifferent state of health made it



<P>an impossibility:&nbsp; he could no more bear the noise of a child



<P>than he could fly; if, indeed, he should ever get well



<P>of his gouty complaints, it would be a different matter:



<P>she should then be glad to take her turn, and think nothing



<P>of the inconvenience; but just now, poor Mr. Norris



<P>took up every moment of her time, and the very mention



<P>of such a thing she was sure would distract him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then she had better come to us," said Lady Bertram,



<P>with the utmost composure.&nbsp; After a short pause Sir Thomas



<P>added with dignity, "Yes, let her home be in this house.



<P>We will endeavour to do our duty by her, and she will,



<P>at least, have the advantage of companions of her own age,



<P>and of a regular instructress."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very true," cried Mrs. Norris, "which are both very



<P>important considerations; and it will be just the same



<P>to Miss Lee whether she has three girls to teach,



<P>or only two--there can be no difference.&nbsp; I only wish I



<P>could be more useful; but you see I do all in my power.



<P>I am not one of those that spare their own trouble;



<P>and Nanny shall fetch her, however it may put me



<P>to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for



<P>three days.&nbsp; I suppose, sister, you will put the child



<P>in the little white attic, near the old nurseries.



<P>It will be much the best place for her, so near Miss Lee,



<P>and not far from the girls, and close by the housemaids,



<P>who could either of them help to dress her, you know,



<P>and take care of her clothes, for I suppose you would not



<P>think it fair to expect Ellis to wait on her as well as



<P>the others.&nbsp; Indeed, I do not see that you could possibly



<P>place her anywhere else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Bertram made no opposition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope she will prove a well-disposed girl,"



<P>continued Mrs. Norris, "and be sensible of her uncommon



<P>good fortune in having such friends."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Should her disposition be really bad," said Sir Thomas,



<P>"we must not, for our own children's sake, continue her



<P>in the family; but there is no reason to expect so great



<P>an evil.&nbsp; We shall probably see much to wish altered



<P>in her, and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance,



<P>some meanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity



<P>of manner; but these are not incurable faults; nor, I trust,



<P>can they be dangerous for her associates.&nbsp; Had my daughters



<P>been _younger_ than herself, I should have considered



<P>the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very



<P>serious moment; but, as it is, I hope there can be nothing



<P>to fear for _them_, and everything to hope for _her_,



<P>from the association."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is exactly what I think," cried Mrs. Norris,



<P>"and what I was saying to my husband this morning.



<P>It will be an education for the child, said I, only being



<P>with her cousins; if Miss Lee taught her nothing, she would



<P>learn to be good and clever from _them_."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope she will not tease my poor pug," said Lady Bertram;



<P>"I have but just got Julia to leave it alone."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs. Norris,"



<P>observed Sir Thomas, "as to the distinction proper to be made



<P>between the girls as they grow up:&nbsp; how to preserve in the



<P>minds of my _daughters_ the consciousness of what they are,



<P>without making them think too lowly of their cousin;



<P>and how, without depressing her spirits too far,



<P>to make her remember that she is not a _Miss Bertram_.



<P>I should wish to see them very good friends, and would,



<P>on no account, authorise in my girls the smallest degree



<P>of arrogance towards their relation; but still they cannot



<P>be equals.&nbsp; Their rank, fortune, rights, and expectations



<P>will always be different.&nbsp; It is a point of great delicacy,



<P>and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly



<P>the right line of conduct."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris was quite at his service; and though she



<P>perfectly agreed with him as to its being a most



<P>difficult thing, encouraged him to hope that between



<P>them it would be easily managed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It will be readily believed that Mrs. Norris did not write



<P>to her sister in vain.&nbsp; Mrs. Price seemed rather surprised



<P>that a girl should be fixed on, when she had so many fine boys,



<P>but accepted the offer most thankfully, assuring them of her



<P>daughter's being a very well-disposed, good-humoured girl,



<P>and trusting they would never have cause to throw her off.



<P>She spoke of her farther as somewhat delicate and puny,



<P>but was sanguine in the hope of her being materially better



<P>for change of air.&nbsp; Poor woman! she probably thought



<P>change of air might agree with many of her children.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Miss Crawford accepted the part very readily; and soon after



<P>Miss Bertram's return from the Parsonage, Mr. Rushworth



<P>arrived, and another character was consequently cast.



<P>He had the offer of Count Cassel and Anhalt, and at first



<P>did not know which to chuse, and wanted Miss Bertram



<P>to direct him; but upon being made to understand the



<P>different style of the characters, and which was which,



<P>and recollecting that he had once seen the play in London,



<P>and had thought Anhalt a very stupid fellow, he soon



<P>decided for the Count.&nbsp; Miss Bertram approved the decision,



<P>for the less he had to learn the better; and though she



<P>could not sympathise in his wish that the Count and



<P>Agatha might be to act together, nor wait very patiently



<P>while he was slowly turning over the leaves with the hope



<P>of still discovering such a scene, she very kindly took



<P>his part in hand, and curtailed every speech that admitted



<P>being shortened; besides pointing out the necessity



<P>of his being very much dressed, and chusing his colours.



<P>Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his finery very well,



<P>though affecting to despise it; and was too much



<P>engaged with what his own appearance would be to think



<P>of the others, or draw any of those conclusions, or feel



<P>any of that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared for.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thus much was settled before Edmund, who had been out all



<P>the morning, knew anything of the matter; but when he



<P>entered the drawing-room before dinner, the buzz of



<P>discussion was high between Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates;



<P>and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity



<P>to tell him the agreeable news.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We have got a play," said he.&nbsp; "It is to be Lovers'



<P>Vows; and I am to be Count Cassel, and am to come



<P>in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak,



<P>and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit,



<P>by way of a shooting-dress. I do not know how I shall like it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's eyes followed Edmund, and her heart beat for him



<P>as she heard this speech, and saw his look, and felt



<P>what his sensations must be.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Lovers' Vows!" in a tone of the greatest amazement,



<P>was his only reply to Mr. Rushworth, and he turned



<P>towards his brother and sisters as if hardly doubting



<P>a contradiction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," cried Mr. Yates.&nbsp; "After all our debatings



<P>and difficulties, we find there is nothing that will



<P>suit us altogether so well, nothing so unexceptionable,



<P>as Lovers' Vows.&nbsp; The wonder is that it should not have been



<P>thought of before.&nbsp; My stupidity was abominable, for here



<P>we have all the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford;



<P>and it is so useful to have anything of a model!



<P>We have cast almost every part."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But what do you do for women?" said Edmund gravely,



<P>and looking at Maria.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered,



<P>"I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done,



<P>and" (with a bolder eye) "Miss Crawford is to be Amelia."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so



<P>easily filled up, with _us_," replied Edmund, turning away



<P>to the fire, where sat his mother, aunt, and Fanny,



<P>and seating himself with a look of great vexation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Rushworth followed him to say, "I come in three times,



<P>and have two-and-forty speeches.&nbsp; That's something,



<P>is not it?&nbsp; But I do not much like the idea of being so fine.



<P>I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink



<P>satin cloak."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund could not answer him.&nbsp; In a few minutes Mr. Bertram



<P>was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts



<P>of the carpenter; and being accompanied by Mr. Yates,



<P>and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth, Edmund almost



<P>immediately took the opportunity of saying, "I cannot,



<P>before Mr. Yates, speak what I feel as to this play,



<P>without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford;



<P>but I must now, my dear Maria, tell _you_, that I



<P>think it exceedingly unfit for private representation,



<P>and that I hope you will give it up.&nbsp; I cannot but suppose



<P>you _will_ when you have read it carefully over.



<P>Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt,



<P>and see how you can approve it.&nbsp; It will not be necessary



<P>to send you to your _father's_ judgment, I am convinced."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We see things very differently," cried Maria.



<P>"I am perfectly acquainted with the play, I assure you;



<P>and with a very few omissions, and so forth, which will



<P>be made, of course, I can see nothing objectionable in it;



<P>and _I_ am not the _only_ young woman you find who thinks



<P>it very fit for private representation."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am sorry for it," was his answer; "but in this matter



<P>it is _you_ who are to lead.&nbsp; _You_ must set the example.



<P>If others have blundered, it is your place to put



<P>them right, and shew them what true delicacy is.



<P>In all points of decorum _your_ conduct must be law



<P>to the rest of the party."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This picture of her consequence had some effect, for no



<P>one loved better to lead than Maria; and with far more



<P>good-humour she answered, "I am much obliged to you, Edmund;



<P>you mean very well, I am sure:&nbsp; but I still think you



<P>see things too strongly; and I really cannot undertake



<P>to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind.



<P>_There_ would be the greatest indecorum, I think."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you imagine that I could have such an idea in



<P>my head?&nbsp; No; let your conduct be the only harangue.



<P>Say that, on examining the part, you feel yourself



<P>unequal to it; that you find it requiring more exertion



<P>and confidence than you can be supposed to have.



<P>Say this with firmness, and it will be quite enough.



<P>All who can distinguish will understand your motive.



<P>The play will be given up, and your delicacy honoured as



<P>it ought."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do not act anything improper, my dear," said Lady Bertram.



<P>"Sir Thomas would not like it.--Fanny, ring the bell;



<P>I must have my dinner.--To be sure, Julia is dressed by



<P>this time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am convinced, madam," said Edmund, preventing Fanny,



<P>"that Sir Thomas would not like it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There, my dear, do you hear what Edmund says?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I were to decline the part," said Maria,



<P>with renewed zeal, "Julia would certainly take it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What!" cried Edmund, "if she knew your reasons!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! she might think the difference between us--



<P>the difference in our situations--that _she_ need



<P>not be so scrupulous as _I_ might feel necessary.



<P>I am sure she would argue so.&nbsp; No; you must excuse me;



<P>I cannot retract my consent; it is too far settled,



<P>everybody would be so disappointed, Tom would be quite angry;



<P>and if we are so very nice, we shall never act anything."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was just going to say the very same thing," said Mrs. Norris.



<P>"If every play is to be objected to, you will act nothing,



<P>and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away,



<P>and I am sure _that_ would be a discredit to us all.



<P>I do not know the play; but, as Maria says, if there



<P>is anything a little too warm (and it is so with most



<P>of them) it can be easily left out.&nbsp; We must not be



<P>over-precise, Edmund.&nbsp; As Mr. Rushworth is to act too,



<P>there can be no harm.&nbsp; I only wish Tom had known his own



<P>mind when the carpenters began, for there was the loss



<P>of half a day's work about those side-doors. The curtain



<P>will be a good job, however.&nbsp; The maids do their work



<P>very well, and I think we shall be able to send back



<P>some dozens of the rings.&nbsp; There is no occasion to put



<P>them so very close together.&nbsp; I _am_ of some use, I hope,



<P>in preventing waste and making the most of things.



<P>There should always be one steady head to superintend



<P>so many young ones.&nbsp; I forgot to tell Tom of something



<P>that happened to me this very day.&nbsp; I had been looking



<P>about me in the poultry-yard, and was just coming out,



<P>when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up



<P>to the servants' hall-door with two bits of deal board



<P>in his hand, bringing them to father, you may be sure;



<P>mother had chanced to send him of a message to father,



<P>and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board,



<P>for he could not no how do without them.&nbsp; I knew what all



<P>this meant, for the servants' dinner-bell was ringing



<P>at the very moment over our heads; and as I hate such



<P>encroaching people (the Jacksons are very encroaching,



<P>I have always said so:&nbsp; just the sort of people to get



<P>all they can), I said to the boy directly (a great lubberly



<P>fellow of ten years old, you know, who ought to be ashamed



<P>of himself), "_I'll_ take the boards to your father,



<P>Dick, so get you home again as fast as you can."



<P>The boy looked very silly, and turned away without



<P>offering a word, for I believe I might speak pretty sharp;



<P>and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding



<P>about the house for one while.&nbsp; I hate such greediness--



<P>so good as your father is to the family, employing the man



<P>all the year round!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nobody was at the trouble of an answer; the others



<P>soon returned; and Edmund found that to have endeavoured



<P>to set them right must be his only satisfaction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dinner passed heavily.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris related again



<P>her triumph over Dick Jackson, but neither play nor



<P>preparation were otherwise much talked of, for Edmund's



<P>disapprobation was felt even by his brother, though he



<P>would not have owned it.&nbsp; Maria, wanting Henry Crawford's



<P>animating support, thought the subject better avoided.



<P>Mr. Yates, who was trying to make himself agreeable to Julia,



<P>found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic than



<P>that of his regret at her secession from their company;



<P>and Mr. Rushworth, having only his own part and his own



<P>dress in his head, had soon talked away all that could



<P>be said of either.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an



<P>hour or two:&nbsp; there was still a great deal to be settled;



<P>and the spirits of evening giving fresh courage, Tom, Maria,



<P>and Mr. Yates, soon after their being reassembled



<P>in the drawing-room, seated themselves in committee



<P>at a separate table, with the play open before them,



<P>and were just getting deep in the subject when a most



<P>welcome interruption was given by the entrance of Mr. and



<P>Miss Crawford, who, late and dark and dirty as it was,



<P>could not help coming, and were received with the most grateful



<P>joy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, how do you go on?" and "What have you settled?"



<P>and "Oh! we can do nothing without you," followed the



<P>first salutations; and Henry Crawford was soon seated



<P>with the other three at the table, while his sister made



<P>her way to Lady Bertram, and with pleasant attention



<P>was complimenting _her_.&nbsp; "I must really congratulate



<P>your ladyship," said she, "on the play being chosen;



<P>for though you have borne it with exemplary patience, I am



<P>sure you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties.



<P>The actors may be glad, but the bystanders must be infinitely



<P>more thankful for a decision; and I do sincerely give



<P>you joy, madam, as well as Mrs. Norris, and everybody else



<P>who is in the same predicament," glancing half fearfully,



<P>half slyly, beyond Fanny to Edmund.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram,



<P>but Edmund said nothing.&nbsp; His being only a bystander was



<P>not disclaimed.&nbsp; After continuing in chat with the party



<P>round the fire a few minutes, Miss Crawford returned



<P>to the party round the table; and standing by them,



<P>seemed to interest herself in their arrangements till,



<P>as if struck by a sudden recollection, she exclaimed,



<P>"My good friends, you are most composedly at work upon



<P>these cottages and alehouses, inside and out; but pray let



<P>me know my fate in the meanwhile.&nbsp; Who is to be Anhalt?



<P>What gentleman among you am I to have the pleasure of making



<P>love to?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For a moment no one spoke; and then many spoke together



<P>to tell the same melancholy truth, that they had not yet



<P>got any Anhalt.&nbsp; "Mr. Rushworth was to be Count Cassel,



<P>but no one had yet undertaken Anhalt."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had my choice of the parts," said Mr. Rushworth;



<P>"but I thought I should like the Count best, though I do



<P>not much relish the finery I am to have."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You chose very wisely, I am sure," replied Miss Crawford,



<P>with a brightened look; "Anhalt is a heavy part."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_The_ _Count_ has two-and-forty speeches,"



<P>returned Mr. Rushworth, "which is no trifle."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am not at all surprised," said Miss Crawford,



<P>after a short pause, "at this want of an Anhalt.



<P>Amelia deserves no better.&nbsp; Such a forward young lady



<P>may well frighten the men."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should be but too happy in taking the part, if it



<P>were possible," cried Tom; "but, unluckily, the Butler



<P>and Anhalt are in together.&nbsp; I will not entirely give



<P>it up, however; I will try what can be done--I will look



<P>it over again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your _brother_ should take the part," said Mr. Yates,



<P>in a low voice.&nbsp; "Do not you think he would?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_I_ shall not ask him," replied Tom, in a cold,



<P>determined manner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford talked of something else, and soon afterwards



<P>rejoined the party at the fire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They do not want me at all," said she, seating herself.



<P>"I only puzzle them, and oblige them to make civil speeches.



<P>Mr. Edmund Bertram, as you do not act yourself,



<P>you will be a disinterested adviser; and, therefore,



<P>I apply to _you_.&nbsp; What shall we do for an Anhalt?



<P>Is it practicable for any of the others to double it?



<P>What is your advice?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My advice," said he calmly, "is that you change the play."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_I_ should have no objection," she replied; "for though



<P>I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia



<P>if well supported, that is, if everything went well,



<P>I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience; but as they



<P>do not chuse to hear your advice at _that_ _table_"



<P>(looking round), "it certainly will not be taken."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund said no more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If _any_ part could tempt _you_ to act, I suppose it would



<P>be Anhalt," observed the lady archly, after a short pause;



<P>"for he is a clergyman, you know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_That_ circumstance would by no means tempt me,"



<P>he replied, "for I should be sorry to make the character



<P>ridiculous by bad acting.&nbsp; It must be very difficult



<P>to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal, solemn lecturer;



<P>and the man who chuses the profession itself is, perhaps,



<P>one of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford was silenced, and with some feelings of resentment



<P>and mortification, moved her chair considerably nearer the



<P>tea-table, and gave all her attention to Mrs. Norris, who was



<P>presiding there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Fanny," cried Tom Bertram, from the other table,



<P>where the conference was eagerly carrying on, and the



<P>conversation incessant, "we want your services"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was up in a moment, expecting some errand; for the



<P>habit of employing her in that way was not yet overcome,



<P>in spite of all that Edmund could do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! we do not want to disturb you from your seat.



<P>We do not want your _present_ services.&nbsp; We shall only want



<P>you in our play.&nbsp; You must be Cottager's wife."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me!" cried Fanny, sitting down again with a most frightened look.



<P>"Indeed you must excuse me.&nbsp; I could not act anything



<P>if you were to give me the world.&nbsp; No, indeed, I cannot act."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed, but you must, for we cannot excuse you.



<P>It need not frighten you:&nbsp; it is a nothing of a part,



<P>a mere nothing, not above half a dozen speeches altogether,



<P>and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say;



<P>so you may be as creep-mouse as you like, but we must have



<P>you to look at."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches," cried Mr. Rushworth,



<P>"what would you do with such a part as mine?&nbsp; I have forty-two

to



<P>learn."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart,"



<P>said Fanny, shocked to find herself at that moment the



<P>only speaker in the room, and to feel that almost every



<P>eye was upon her; "but I really cannot act."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, yes, you can act well enough for _us_.



<P>Learn your part, and we will teach you all the rest.



<P>You have only two scenes, and as I shall be Cottager,



<P>I'll put you in and push you about, and you will do it



<P>very well, I'll answer for it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, indeed, Mr. Bertram, you must excuse me.&nbsp; You cannot



<P>have an idea.&nbsp; It would be absolutely impossible for me.



<P>If I were to undertake it, I should only disappoint you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Phoo!&nbsp; Phoo!&nbsp; Do not be so shamefaced.&nbsp; You'll do it



<P>very well.&nbsp; Every allowance will be made for you.



<P>We do not expect perfection.&nbsp; You must get a brown gown,



<P>and a white apron, and a mob cap, and we must make



<P>you a few wrinkles, and a little of the crowsfoot at



<P>the corner of your eyes, and you will be a very proper,



<P>little old woman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You must excuse me, indeed you must excuse me," cried Fanny,



<P>growing more and more red from excessive agitation,



<P>and looking distressfully at Edmund, who was kindly



<P>observing her; but unwilling to exasperate his brother



<P>by interference, gave her only an encouraging smile.



<P>Her entreaty had no effect on Tom:&nbsp; he only said again



<P>what he had said before; and it was not merely Tom,



<P>for the requisition was now backed by Maria, and Mr. Crawford,



<P>and Mr. Yates, with an urgency which differed from



<P>his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious,



<P>and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny;



<P>and before she could breathe after it, Mrs. Norris completed



<P>the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry



<P>and audible--"What a piece of work here is about nothing:



<P>I am quite ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a difficulty



<P>of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort--so kind



<P>as they are to you!&nbsp; Take the part with a good grace,



<P>and let us hear no more of the matter, I entreat."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do not urge her, madam," said Edmund.&nbsp; "It is not fair to



<P>urge her in this manner.&nbsp; You see she does not like to act.



<P>Let her chuse for herself, as well as the rest of us.



<P>Her judgment may be quite as safely trusted.&nbsp; Do not urge



<P>her any more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am not going to urge her," replied Mrs. Norris sharply;



<P>"but I shall think her a very obstinate, ungrateful girl,



<P>if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her--



<P>very ungrateful, indeed, considering who and what she is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund was too angry to speak; but Miss Crawford,



<P>looking for a moment with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris,



<P>and then at Fanny, whose tears were beginning to shew



<P>themselves, immediately said, with some keenness, "I do



<P>not like my situation:&nbsp; this _place_ is too hot for me,"



<P>and moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table,



<P>close to Fanny, saying to her, in a kind, low whisper,



<P>as she placed herself, "Never mind, my dear Miss Price,



<P>this is a cross evening:&nbsp; everybody is cross and teasing,



<P>but do not let us mind them"; and with pointed attention



<P>continued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits,



<P>in spite of being out of spirits herself.&nbsp; By a look at



<P>her brother she prevented any farther entreaty from the



<P>theatrical board, and the really good feelings by which she



<P>was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her



<P>to all the little she had lost in Edmund's favour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny did not love Miss Crawford; but she felt very much



<P>obliged to her for her present kindness; and when,



<P>from taking notice of her work, and wishing _she_ could



<P>work as well, and begging for the pattern, and supposing



<P>Fanny was now preparing for her _appearance_, as of



<P>course she would come out when her cousin was married,



<P>Miss Crawford proceeded to inquire if she had heard lately



<P>from her brother at sea, and said that she had quite



<P>a curiosity to see him, and imagined him a very fine



<P>young man, and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn



<P>before he went to sea again--she could not help admitting



<P>it to be very agreeable flattery, or help listening,



<P>and answering with more animation than she had intended.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The consultation upon the play still went on, and Miss



<P>Crawford's attention was first called from Fanny by Tom



<P>Bertram's telling her, with infinite regret, that he



<P>found it absolutely impossible for him to undertake the



<P>part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler:&nbsp; he had been



<P>most anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible,



<P>but it would not do; he must give it up.&nbsp; "But there will



<P>not be the smallest difficulty in filling it," he added.



<P>"We have but to speak the word; we may pick and chuse.



<P>I could name, at this moment, at least six young men within



<P>six miles of us, who are wild to be admitted into our company,



<P>and there are one or two that would not disgrace us:



<P>I should not be afraid to trust either of the Olivers



<P>or Charles Maddox.&nbsp; Tom Oliver is a very clever fellow,



<P>and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will



<P>see anywhere, so I will take my horse early to-morrow



<P>morning and ride over to Stoke, and settle with one



<P>of them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While he spoke, Maria was looking apprehensively round



<P>at Edmund in full expectation that he must oppose such



<P>an enlargement of the plan as this:&nbsp; so contrary to all



<P>their first protestations; but Edmund said nothing.



<P>After a moment's thought, Miss Crawford calmly replied,



<P>"As far as I am concerned, I can have no objection to



<P>anything that you all think eligible.&nbsp; Have I ever seen



<P>either of the gentlemen?&nbsp; Yes, Mr. Charles Maddox dined



<P>at my sister's one day, did not he, Henry?&nbsp; A quiet-looking



<P>young man.&nbsp; I remember him.&nbsp; Let _him_ be applied to,



<P>if you please, for it will be less unpleasant to me than



<P>to have a perfect stranger."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charles Maddox was to be the man.&nbsp; Tom repeated his resolution



<P>of going to him early on the morrow; and though Julia,



<P>who had scarcely opened her lips before, observed, in a



<P>sarcastic manner, and with a glance first at Maria and then



<P>at Edmund, that "the Mansfield theatricals would enliven



<P>the whole neighbourhood exceedingly," Edmund still held



<P>his peace, and shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am not very sanguine as to our play," said Miss Crawford,



<P>in an undervoice to Fanny, after some consideration;



<P>"and I can tell Mr. Maddox that I shall shorten some



<P>of _his_ speeches, and a great many of _my_ _own_,



<P>before we rehearse together.&nbsp; It will be very disagreeable,



<P>and by no means what I expected."

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The ball was over, and the breakfast was soon over too;



<P>the last kiss was given, and William was gone.



<P>Mr. Crawford had, as he foretold, been very punctual,



<P>and short and pleasant had been the meal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked



<P>back to the breakfast-room with a very saddened heart



<P>to grieve over the melancholy change; and there her uncle



<P>kindly left her to cry in peace, conceiving, perhaps,



<P>that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise



<P>her tender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork



<P>bones and mustard in William's plate might but divide



<P>her feelings with the broken egg-shells in Mr. Crawford's.



<P>She sat and cried _con_ _amore_ as her uncle intended,



<P>but it was _con_ _amore_ fraternal and no other.



<P>William was gone, and she now felt as if she had wasted



<P>half his visit in idle cares and selfish solicitudes



<P>unconnected with him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's disposition was such that she could never even think



<P>of her aunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness



<P>of her own small house, without reproaching herself



<P>for some little want of attention to her when they had



<P>been last together; much less could her feelings acquit



<P>her of having done and said and thought everything



<P>by William that was due to him for a whole fortnight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a heavy, melancholy day.&nbsp; Soon after the second



<P>breakfast, Edmund bade them good-bye for a week, and mounted



<P>his horse for Peterborough, and then all were gone.



<P>Nothing remained of last night but remembrances, which she



<P>had nobody to share in.&nbsp; She talked to her aunt Bertram--



<P>she must talk to somebody of the ball; but her aunt had seen



<P>so little of what had passed, and had so little curiosity,



<P>that it was heavy work.&nbsp; Lady Bertram was not certain of



<P>anybody's dress or anybody's place at supper but her own.



<P>"She could not recollect what it was that she had heard



<P>about one of the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was that Lady



<P>Prescott had noticed in Fanny:&nbsp; she was not sure whether



<P>Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of



<P>William when he said he was the finest young man in the room--



<P>somebody had whispered something to her; she had forgot



<P>to ask Sir Thomas what it could be."&nbsp; And these were her



<P>longest speeches and clearest communications:&nbsp; the rest



<P>was only a languid "Yes, yes; very well; did you? did he?



<P>I did not see _that_; I should not know one from the other."



<P>This was very bad.&nbsp; It was only better than Mrs. Norris's



<P>sharp answers would have been; but she being gone home



<P>with all the supernumerary jellies to nurse a sick maid,



<P>there was peace and good-humour in their little party,



<P>though it could not boast much beside.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The evening was heavy like the day.&nbsp; "I cannot think



<P>what is the matter with me," said Lady Bertram,



<P>when the tea-things were removed.&nbsp; "I feel quite stupid.



<P>It must be sitting up so late last night.&nbsp; Fanny, you must



<P>do something to keep me awake.&nbsp; I cannot work.



<P>Fetch the cards; I feel so very stupid."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The cards were brought, and Fanny played at cribbage



<P>with her aunt till bedtime; and as Sir Thomas was reading



<P>to himself, no sounds were heard in the room for the next



<P>two hours beyond the reckonings of the game--"And _that_



<P>makes thirty-one; four in hand and eight in crib.



<P>You are to deal, ma'am; shall I deal for you?"&nbsp; Fanny thought



<P>and thought again of the difference which twenty-four hours



<P>had made in that room, and all that part of the house.



<P>Last night it had been hope and smiles, bustle and motion,



<P>noise and brilliancy, in the drawing-room, and out of



<P>the drawing-room, and everywhere.&nbsp; Now it was languor,



<P>and all but solitude.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A good night's rest improved her spirits.&nbsp; She could think



<P>of William the next day more cheerfully; and as the morning



<P>afforded her an opportunity of talking over Thursday night



<P>with Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford, in a very handsome style,



<P>with all the heightenings of imagination, and all the



<P>laughs of playfulness which are so essential to the shade



<P>of a departed ball, she could afterwards bring her mind



<P>without much effort into its everyday state, and easily



<P>conform to the tranquillity of the present quiet week.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were indeed a smaller party than she had ever



<P>known there for a whole day together, and _he_ was gone



<P>on whom the comfort and cheerfulness of every family



<P>meeting and every meal chiefly depended.&nbsp; But this must



<P>be learned to be endured.&nbsp; He would soon be always gone;



<P>and she was thankful that she could now sit in the same room



<P>with her uncle, hear his voice, receive his questions,



<P>and even answer them, without such wretched feelings



<P>as she had formerly known.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We miss our two young men," was Sir Thomas's observation



<P>on both the first and second day, as they formed their



<P>very reduced circle after dinner; and in consideration



<P>of Fanny's swimming eyes, nothing more was said



<P>on the first day than to drink their good health;



<P>but on the second it led to something farther.



<P>William was kindly commended and his promotion hoped for.



<P>"And there is no reason to suppose," added Sir Thomas,



<P>"but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent.



<P>As to Edmund, we must learn to do without him.



<P>This will be the last winter of his belonging to us,



<P>as he has done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Lady Bertram, "but I wish he was not going away.



<P>They are all going away, I think.&nbsp; I wish they would stay



<P>at home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This wish was levelled principally at Julia, who had



<P>just applied for permission to go to town with Maria;



<P>and as Sir Thomas thought it best for each daughter that the



<P>permission should be granted, Lady Bertram, though in her own



<P>good-nature she would not have prevented it, was lamenting



<P>the change it made in the prospect of Julia's return,



<P>which would otherwise have taken place about this time.



<P>A great deal of good sense followed on Sir Thomas's side,



<P>tending to reconcile his wife to the arrangement.



<P>Everything that a considerate parent _ought_ to feel was



<P>advanced for her use; and everything that an affectionate



<P>mother _must_ feel in promoting her children's enjoyment



<P>was attributed to her nature.&nbsp; Lady Bertram agreed to it



<P>all with a calm "Yes"; and at the end of a quarter of



<P>an hour's silent consideration spontaneously observed,



<P>"Sir Thomas, I have been thinking--and I am very glad we



<P>took Fanny as we did, for now the others are away we feel



<P>the good of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding,



<P>"Very true.&nbsp; We shew Fanny what a good girl we think



<P>her by praising her to her face, she is now a very



<P>valuable companion.&nbsp; If we have been kind to _her_,



<P>she is now quite as necessary to _us_."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Lady Bertram presently; "and it is a comfort



<P>to think that we shall always have _her_."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas paused, half smiled, glanced at his niece,



<P>and then gravely replied, "She will never leave us, I hope,



<P>till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise



<P>her greater happiness than she knows here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And _that_ is not very likely to be, Sir Thomas.



<P>Who should invite her?&nbsp; Maria might be very glad to see her



<P>at Sotherton now and then, but she would not think of asking



<P>her to live there; and I am sure she is better off here;



<P>and besides, I cannot do without her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The week which passed so quietly and peaceably at the



<P>great house in Mansfield had a very different character at



<P>the Parsonage.&nbsp; To the young lady, at least, in each family,



<P>it brought very different feelings.&nbsp; What was tranquillity



<P>and comfort to Fanny was tediousness and vexation to Mary.



<P>Something arose from difference of disposition and habit:



<P>one so easily satisfied, the other so unused to endure;



<P>but still more might be imputed to difference



<P>of circumstances.&nbsp; In some points of interest they



<P>were exactly opposed to each other.&nbsp; To Fanny's mind,



<P>Edmund's absence was really, in its cause and its tendency,



<P>a relief.&nbsp; To Mary it was every way painful.&nbsp; She felt



<P>the want of his society every day, almost every hour,



<P>and was too much in want of it to derive anything but



<P>irritation from considering the object for which he went.



<P>He could not have devised anything more likely to raise



<P>his consequence than this week's absence, occurring as



<P>it did at the very time of her brother's going away,



<P>of William Price's going too, and completing the sort



<P>of general break-up of a party which had been so animated.



<P>She felt it keenly.&nbsp; They were now a miserable trio,



<P>confined within doors by a series of rain and snow,



<P>with nothing to do and no variety to hope for.&nbsp; Angry as



<P>she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions,



<P>and acting on them in defiance of her (and she had been



<P>so angry that they had hardly parted friends at the ball),



<P>she could not help thinking of him continually when absent,



<P>dwelling on his merit and affection, and longing again



<P>for the almost daily meetings they lately had.&nbsp; His absence



<P>was unnecessarily long.&nbsp; He should not have planned such



<P>an absence--he should not have left home for a week,



<P>when her own departure from Mansfield was so near.



<P>Then she began to blame herself.&nbsp; She wished she had not



<P>spoken so warmly in their last conversation.&nbsp; She was afraid



<P>she had used some strong, some contemptuous expressions



<P>in speaking of the clergy, and that should not have been.



<P>It was ill-bred; it was wrong.&nbsp; She wished such words unsaid



<P>with all her heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her vexation did not end with the week.&nbsp; All this was bad,



<P>but she had still more to feel when Friday came round



<P>again and brought no Edmund; when Saturday came and still



<P>no Edmund; and when, through the slight communication



<P>with the other family which Sunday produced, she learned



<P>that he had actually written home to defer his return,



<P>having promised to remain some days longer with his friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If she had felt impatience and regret before--if she had



<P>been sorry for what she said, and feared its too strong



<P>effect on him--she now felt and feared it all tenfold more.



<P>She had, moreover, to contend with one disagreeable emotion



<P>entirely new to her--jealousy.&nbsp; His friend Mr. Owen had sisters;



<P>he might find them attractive.&nbsp; But, at any rate, his staying



<P>away at a time when, according to all preceding plans,



<P>she was to remove to London, meant something that she could



<P>not bear.&nbsp; Had Henry returned, as he talked of doing,



<P>at the end of three or four days, she should now have



<P>been leaving Mansfield.&nbsp; It became absolutely necessary



<P>for her to get to Fanny and try to learn something more.



<P>She could not live any longer in such solitary wretchedness;



<P>and she made her way to the Park, through difficulties



<P>of walking which she had deemed unconquerable a week before,



<P>for the chance of hearing a little in addition, for the



<P>sake of at least hearing his name.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The first half-hour was lost, for Fanny and Lady Bertram



<P>were together, and unless she had Fanny to herself she could



<P>hope for nothing.&nbsp; But at last Lady Bertram left the room,



<P>and then almost immediately Miss Crawford thus began,



<P>with a voice as well regulated as she could--"And how do



<P>_you_ like your cousin Edmund's staying away so long?



<P>Being the only young person at home, I consider _you_



<P>as the greatest sufferer.&nbsp; You must miss him.&nbsp; Does his



<P>staying longer surprise you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know," said Fanny hesitatingly.&nbsp; "Yes; I had



<P>not particularly expected it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of.



<P>It is the general way all young men do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He did not, the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He finds the house more agreeable _now_. He is a very--



<P>a very pleasing young man himself, and I cannot help



<P>being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I



<P>go to London, as will now undoubtedly be the case.



<P>I am looking for Henry every day, and as soon as he



<P>comes there will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield.



<P>I should like to have seen him once more, I confess.



<P>But you must give my compliments to him.&nbsp; Yes; I think it must



<P>be compliments.&nbsp; Is not there a something wanted, Miss Price,



<P>in our language--a something between compliments and--



<P>and love--to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have



<P>had together?&nbsp; So many months' acquaintance!&nbsp; But compliments



<P>may be sufficient here.&nbsp; Was his letter a long one?



<P>Does he give you much account of what he is doing?



<P>Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I only heard a part of the letter; it was to my uncle;



<P>but I believe it was very short; indeed I am sure it was



<P>but a few lines.&nbsp; All that I heard was that his friend



<P>had pressed him to stay longer, and that he had agreed



<P>to do so.&nbsp; A _few_ days longer, or _some_ days longer;



<P>I am not quite sure which."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! if he wrote to his father; but I thought it might



<P>have been to Lady Bertram or you.&nbsp; But if he wrote to



<P>his father, no wonder he was concise.&nbsp; Who could write



<P>chat to Sir Thomas?&nbsp; If he had written to you, there would



<P>have been more particulars.&nbsp; You would have heard of



<P>balls and parties.&nbsp; He would have sent you a description



<P>of everything and everybody.&nbsp; How many Miss Owens are there?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Three grown up."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are they musical?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not at all know.&nbsp; I never heard."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is the first question, you know," said Miss Crawford,



<P>trying to appear gay and unconcerned, "which every



<P>woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another.



<P>But it is very foolish to ask questions about any



<P>young ladies--about any three sisters just grown up;



<P>for one knows, without being told, exactly what they are:



<P>all very accomplished and pleasing, and one very pretty.



<P>There is a beauty in every family; it is a regular thing.



<P>Two play on the pianoforte, and one on the harp;



<P>and all sing, or would sing if they were taught,



<P>or sing all the better for not being taught; or something



<P>like it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know nothing of the Miss Owens," said Fanny calmly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You know nothing and you care less, as people say.



<P>Never did tone express indifference plainer.&nbsp; Indeed, how can



<P>one care for those one has never seen?&nbsp; Well, when your



<P>cousin comes back, he will find Mansfield very quiet;



<P>all the noisy ones gone, your brother and mine and myself



<P>I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time



<P>draws near.&nbsp; She does not like my going."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny felt obliged to speak.&nbsp; "'You cannot doubt your being



<P>missed by many," said she.&nbsp; "You will be very much missed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford turned her eye on her, as if wanting to hear



<P>or see more, and then laughingly said, "Oh yes! missed



<P>as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away;



<P>that is, there is a great difference felt.&nbsp; But I am



<P>not fishing; don't compliment me.&nbsp; If I _am_ missed,



<P>it will appear.&nbsp; I may be discovered by those who want



<P>to see me.&nbsp; I shall not be in any doubtful, or distant,



<P>or unapproachable region."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now Fanny could not bring herself to speak, and Miss



<P>Crawford was disappointed; for she had hoped to hear



<P>some pleasant assurance of her power from one who she



<P>thought must know, and her spirits were clouded again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The Miss Owens," said she, soon afterwards; "suppose you



<P>were to have one of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey;



<P>how should you like it?&nbsp; Stranger things have happened.



<P>I dare say they are trying for it.&nbsp; And they are quite



<P>in the light, for it would be a very pretty establishment



<P>for them.&nbsp; I do not at all wonder or blame them.&nbsp; It is



<P>everybody's duty to do as well for themselves as they can.



<P>Sir Thomas Bertram's son is somebody; and now he is in their



<P>own line.&nbsp; Their father is a clergyman, and their brother



<P>is a clergyman, and they are all clergymen together.



<P>He is their lawful property; he fairly belongs to them.



<P>You don't speak, Fanny; Miss Price, you don't speak.



<P>But honestly now, do not you rather expect it than otherwise?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," said Fanny stoutly, "I do not expect it at all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not at all!" cried Miss Crawford with alacrity.



<P>"I wonder at that.&nbsp; But I dare say you know exactly--



<P>I always imagine you are--perhaps you do not think him



<P>likely to marry at all--or not at present."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I do not," said Fanny softly, hoping she did not err



<P>either in the belief or the acknowledgment of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her companion looked at her keenly; and gathering greater



<P>spirit from the blush soon produced from such a look,



<P>only said, "He is best off as he is," and turned the subject.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Her uncle and both her aunts were in the drawing-room



<P>when Fanny went down.&nbsp; To the former she was an interesting



<P>object, and he saw with pleasure the general elegance



<P>of her appearance, and her being in remarkably good looks.



<P>The neatness and propriety of her dress was all that



<P>he would allow himself to commend in her presence,



<P>but upon her leaving the room again soon afterwards,



<P>he spoke of her beauty with very decided praise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Lady Bertram, "she looks very well.



<P>I sent Chapman to her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Look well!&nbsp; Oh, yes!" cried Mrs. Norris, "she has



<P>good reason to look well with all her advantages:



<P>brought up in this family as she has been, with all



<P>the benefit of her cousins' manners before her.



<P>Only think, my dear Sir Thomas, what extraordinary



<P>advantages you and I have been the means of giving her.



<P>The very gown you have been taking notice of is your own



<P>generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth married.



<P>What would she have been if we had not taken her by



<P>the hand?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas said no more; but when they sat down to table



<P>the eyes of the two young men assured him that the subject



<P>might be gently touched again, when the ladies withdrew,



<P>with more success.&nbsp; Fanny saw that she was approved;



<P>and the consciousness of looking well made her look



<P>still better.&nbsp; From a variety of causes she was happy,



<P>and she was soon made still happier; for in following her



<P>aunts out of the room, Edmund, who was holding open the door,



<P>said, as she passed him, "You must dance with me, Fanny;



<P>you must keep two dances for me; any two that you like,



<P>except the first."&nbsp; She had nothing more to wish for.



<P>She had hardly ever been in a state so nearly approaching



<P>high spirits in her life.&nbsp; Her cousins' former gaiety



<P>on the day of a ball was no longer surprising to her;



<P>she felt it to be indeed very charming, and was actually



<P>practising her steps about the drawing-room as long as she



<P>could be safe from the notice of her aunt Norris, who was



<P>entirely taken up at first in fresh arranging and injuring



<P>the noble fire which the butler had prepared.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Half an hour followed that would have been at least languid



<P>under any other circumstances, but Fanny's happiness



<P>still prevailed.&nbsp; It was but to think of her conversation



<P>with Edmund, and what was the restlessness of Mrs. Norris?



<P>What were the yawns of Lady Bertram?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The gentlemen joined them; and soon after began the sweet



<P>expectation of a carriage, when a general spirit of ease



<P>and enjoyment seemed diffused, and they all stood about



<P>and talked and laughed, and every moment had its pleasure



<P>and its hope.&nbsp; Fanny felt that there must be a struggle



<P>in Edmund's cheerfulness, but it was delightful to see



<P>the effort so successfully made.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the carriages were really heard, when the guests began



<P>really to assemble, her own gaiety of heart was much subdued:



<P>the sight of so many strangers threw her back into herself;



<P>and besides the gravity and formality of the first great circle,



<P>which the manners of neither Sir Thomas nor Lady Bertram



<P>were of a kind to do away, she found herself occasionally



<P>called on to endure something worse.&nbsp; She was introduced



<P>here and there by her uncle, and forced to be spoken to,



<P>and to curtsey, and speak again.&nbsp; This was a hard duty,



<P>and she was never summoned to it without looking at William,



<P>as he walked about at his ease in the background of the scene,



<P>and longing to be with him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The entrance of the Grants and Crawfords was a favourable epoch.



<P>The stiffness of the meeting soon gave way before their



<P>popular manners and more diffused intimacies:&nbsp; little groups



<P>were formed, and everybody grew comfortable.&nbsp; Fanny felt



<P>the advantage; and, drawing back from the toils of civility,



<P>would have been again most happy, could she have kept



<P>her eyes from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford.



<P>_She_ looked all loveliness--and what might not be



<P>the end of it?&nbsp; Her own musings were brought to an end



<P>on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her, and her thoughts



<P>were put into another channel by his engaging her almost



<P>instantly for the first two dances.&nbsp; Her happiness on this



<P>occasion was very much _a_ _la_ _mortal_, finely chequered.



<P>To be secure of a partner at first was a most essential good--



<P>for the moment of beginning was now growing seriously near;



<P>and she so little understood her own claims as to think



<P>that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her, she must have been



<P>the last to be sought after, and should have received



<P>a partner only through a series of inquiry, and bustle,



<P>and interference, which would have been terrible; but at



<P>the same time there was a pointedness in his manner of asking



<P>her which she did not like, and she saw his eye glancing



<P>for a moment at her necklace, with a smile--she thought



<P>there was a smile--which made her blush and feel wretched.



<P>And though there was no second glance to disturb her,



<P>though his object seemed then to be only quietly agreeable,



<P>she could not get the better of her embarrassment,



<P>heightened as it was by the idea of his perceiving it,



<P>and had no composure till he turned away to some one else.



<P>Then she could gradually rise up to the genuine satisfaction



<P>of having a partner, a voluntary partner, secured against



<P>the dancing began.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the company were moving into the ballroom, she found



<P>herself for the first time near Miss Crawford, whose eyes



<P>and smiles were immediately and more unequivocally directed



<P>as her brother's had been, and who was beginning to speak



<P>on the subject, when Fanny, anxious to get the story over,



<P>hastened to give the explanation of the second necklace:



<P>the real chain.&nbsp; Miss Crawford listened; and all her intended



<P>compliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten:



<P>she felt only one thing; and her eyes, bright as they



<P>had been before, shewing they could yet be brighter,



<P>she exclaimed with eager pleasure, "Did he?&nbsp; Did Edmund?



<P>That was like himself.&nbsp; No other man would have thought of it.



<P>I honour him beyond expression."&nbsp; And she looked around



<P>as if longing to tell him so.&nbsp; He was not near, he was



<P>attending a party of ladies out of the room; and Mrs. Grant



<P>coming up to the two girls, and taking an arm of each,



<P>they followed with the rest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's heart sunk, but there was no leisure for



<P>thinking long even of Miss Crawford's feelings.



<P>They were in the ballroom, the violins were playing,



<P>and her mind was in a flutter that forbade its fixing on



<P>anything serious.&nbsp; She must watch the general arrangements,



<P>and see how everything was done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a few minutes Sir Thomas came to her, and asked if



<P>she were engaged; and the "Yes, sir; to Mr. Crawford,"



<P>was exactly what he had intended to hear.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford



<P>was not far off; Sir Thomas brought him to her,



<P>saying something which discovered to Fanny, that _she_



<P>was to lead the way and open the ball; an idea that had



<P>never occurred to her before.&nbsp; Whenever she had thought



<P>of the minutiae of the evening, it had been as a matter



<P>of course that Edmund would begin with Miss Crawford;



<P>and the impression was so strong, that though _her_ _uncle_



<P>spoke the contrary, she could not help an exclamation



<P>of surprise, a hint of her unfitness, an entreaty even to



<P>be excused.&nbsp; To be urging her opinion against Sir Thomas's



<P>was a proof of the extremity of the case; but such was her



<P>horror at the first suggestion, that she could actually



<P>look him in the face and say that she hoped it might be



<P>settled otherwise; in vain, however:&nbsp; Sir Thomas smiled,



<P>tried to encourage her, and then looked too serious,



<P>and said too decidedly, "It must be so, my dear," for her



<P>to hazard another word; and she found herself the next



<P>moment conducted by Mr. Crawford to the top of the room,



<P>and standing there to be joined by the rest of the dancers,



<P>couple after couple, as they were formed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could hardly believe it.&nbsp; To be placed above so many



<P>elegant young women!&nbsp; The distinction was too great.



<P>It was treating her like her cousins!&nbsp; And her thoughts



<P>flew to those absent cousins with most unfeigned and truly



<P>tender regret, that they were not at home to take their



<P>own place in the room, and have their share of a pleasure



<P>which would have been so very delightful to them.



<P>So often as she had heard them wish for a ball at home



<P>as the greatest of all felicities!&nbsp; And to have them away



<P>when it was given--and for _her_ to be opening the ball--



<P>and with Mr. Crawford too!&nbsp; She hoped they would not envy



<P>her that distinction _now_; but when she looked back



<P>to the state of things in the autumn, to what they had all



<P>been to each other when once dancing in that house before,



<P>the present arrangement was almost more than she could



<P>understand herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The ball began.&nbsp; It was rather honour than happiness



<P>to Fanny, for the first dance at least:&nbsp; her partner was



<P>in excellent spirits, and tried to impart them to her;



<P>but she was a great deal too much frightened to have



<P>any enjoyment till she could suppose herself no longer



<P>looked at.&nbsp; Young, pretty, and gentle, however, she had



<P>no awkwardnesses that were not as good as graces,



<P>and there were few persons present that were not disposed



<P>to praise her.&nbsp; She was attractive, she was modest,



<P>she was Sir Thomas's niece, and she was soon said



<P>to be admired by Mr. Crawford.&nbsp; It was enough to give



<P>her general favour.&nbsp; Sir Thomas himself was watching



<P>her progress down the dance with much complacency;



<P>he was proud of his niece; and without attributing



<P>all her personal beauty, as Mrs. Norris seemed to do,



<P>to her transplantation to Mansfield, he was pleased



<P>with himself for having supplied everything else:



<P>education and manners she owed to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas's thoughts as he stood,



<P>and having, in spite of all his wrongs towards her,



<P>a general prevailing desire of recommending herself to him,



<P>took an opportunity of stepping aside to say something



<P>agreeable of Fanny.&nbsp; Her praise was warm, and he received



<P>it as she could wish, joining in it as far as discretion,



<P>and politeness, and slowness of speech would allow,



<P>and certainly appearing to greater advantage on the subject



<P>than his lady did soon afterwards, when Mary, perceiving her



<P>on a sofa very near, turned round before she began to dance,



<P>to compliment her on Miss Price's looks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, she does look very well," was Lady Bertram's placid reply.



<P>"Chapman helped her to dress.&nbsp; I sent Chapman to her."



<P>Not but that she was really pleased to have Fanny admired;



<P>but she was so much more struck with her own kindness



<P>in sending Chapman to her, that she could not get it out



<P>of her head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of



<P>gratifying _her_ by commendation of Fanny; to her, it was



<P>as the occasion offered--"Ah! ma'am, how much we want dear



<P>Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to-night!" and Mrs. Norris paid



<P>her with as many smiles and courteous words as she had



<P>time for, amid so much occupation as she found for herself



<P>in making up card-tables, giving hints to Sir Thomas,



<P>and trying to move all the chaperons to a better part of the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford blundered most towards Fanny herself in her



<P>intentions to please.&nbsp; She meant to be giving her little



<P>heart a happy flutter, and filling her with sensations



<P>of delightful self-consequence; and, misinterpreting Fanny's



<P>blushes, still thought she must be doing so when she



<P>went to her after the two first dances, and said, with a



<P>significant look, "Perhaps _you_ can tell me why my brother



<P>goes to town to-morrow? He says he has business there,



<P>but will not tell me what.&nbsp; The first time he ever denied



<P>me his confidence!&nbsp; But this is what we all come to.



<P>All are supplanted sooner or later.&nbsp; Now, I must apply



<P>to you for information.&nbsp; Pray, what is Henry going for?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny protested her ignorance as steadily as her



<P>embarrassment allowed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, then," replied Miss Crawford, laughing, "I must



<P>suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of conveying



<P>your brother, and of talking of you by the way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was confused, but it was the confusion of discontent;



<P>while Miss Crawford wondered she did not smile, and thought



<P>her over-anxious, or thought her odd, or thought her anything



<P>rather than insensible of pleasure in Henry's attentions.



<P>Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in the course of the evening;



<P>but Henry's attentions had very little to do with it.



<P>She would much rather _not_ have been asked by him again



<P>so very soon, and she wished she had not been obliged



<P>to suspect that his previous inquiries of Mrs. Norris,



<P>about the supper hour, were all for the sake of securing her



<P>at that part of the evening.&nbsp; But it was not to be avoided:



<P>he made her feel that she was the object of all; though she



<P>could not say that it was unpleasantly done, that there



<P>was indelicacy or ostentation in his manner; and sometimes,



<P>when he talked of William, he was really not unagreeable,



<P>and shewed even a warmth of heart which did him credit.



<P>But still his attentions made no part of her satisfaction.



<P>She was happy whenever she looked at William, and saw how



<P>perfectly he was enjoying himself, in every five minutes



<P>that she could walk about with him and hear his account



<P>of his partners; she was happy in knowing herself admired;



<P>and she was happy in having the two dances with Edmund still



<P>to look forward to, during the greatest part of the evening,



<P>her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite



<P>engagement with _him_ was in continual perspective.



<P>She was happy even when they did take place; but not from



<P>any flow of spirits on his side, or any such expressions



<P>of tender gallantry as had blessed the morning.



<P>His mind was fagged, and her happiness sprung from



<P>being the friend with whom it could find repose.



<P>"I am worn out with civility," said he.&nbsp; "I have been



<P>talking incessantly all night, and with nothing to say.



<P>But with _you_, Fanny, there may be peace.&nbsp; You will not



<P>want to be talked to.&nbsp; Let us have the luxury of silence."



<P>Fanny would hardly even speak her agreement.&nbsp; A weariness,



<P>arising probably, in great measure, from the same feelings



<P>which he had acknowledged in the morning, was peculiarly



<P>to be respected, and they went down their two dances together



<P>with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker-on



<P>that Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his



<P>younger son.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The evening had afforded Edmund little pleasure.&nbsp; Miss Crawford



<P>had been in gay spirits when they first danced together,



<P>but it was not her gaiety that could do him good:



<P>it rather sank than raised his comfort; and afterwards,



<P>for he found himself still impelled to seek her again,



<P>she had absolutely pained him by her manner of speaking of the



<P>profession to which he was now on the point of belonging.



<P>They had talked, and they had been silent; he had reasoned,



<P>she had ridiculed; and they had parted at last with



<P>mutual vexation.&nbsp; Fanny, not able to refrain entirely from



<P>observing them, had seen enough to be tolerably satisfied.



<P>It was barbarous to be happy when Edmund was suffering.



<P>Yet some happiness must and would arise from the very



<P>conviction that he did suffer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When her two dances with him were over, her inclination



<P>and strength for more were pretty well at an end;



<P>and Sir Thomas, having seen her walk rather than dance



<P>down the shortening set, breathless, and with her hand at



<P>her side, gave his orders for her sitting down entirely.



<P>From that time Mr. Crawford sat down likewise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor Fanny!" cried William, coming for a moment to visit her,



<P>and working away his partner's fan as if for life, "how soon



<P>she is knocked up!&nbsp; Why, the sport is but just begun.



<P>I hope we shall keep it up these two hours.&nbsp; How can you



<P>be tired so soon?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So soon! my good friend," said Sir Thomas, producing his



<P>watch with all necessary caution; "it is three o'clock,



<P>and your sister is not used to these sort of hours."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, then, Fanny, you shall not get up to-morrow before



<P>I go.&nbsp; Sleep as long as you can, and never mind me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!&nbsp; William."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What!&nbsp; Did she think of being up before you set off?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes, sir," cried Fanny, rising eagerly from her seat



<P>to be nearer her uncle; "I must get up and breakfast with him.



<P>It will be the last time, you know; the last morning."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You had better not.&nbsp; He is to have breakfasted and be



<P>gone by half-past nine.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford, I think you call



<P>for him at half-past nine?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was too urgent, however, and had too many tears in her



<P>eyes for denial; and it ended in a gracious "Well, well!"



<P>which was permission.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, half-past nine," said Crawford to William as the



<P>latter was leaving them, "and I shall be punctual,



<P>for there will be no kind sister to get up for _me_."



<P>And in a lower tone to Fanny, "I shall have only a desolate



<P>house to hurry from.&nbsp; Your brother will find my ideas



<P>of time and his own very different to-morrow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a short consideration, Sir Thomas asked Crawford



<P>to join the early breakfast party in that house



<P>instead of eating alone:&nbsp; he should himself be of it;



<P>and the readiness with which his invitation was accepted



<P>convinced him that the suspicions whence, he must confess



<P>to himself, this very ball had in great measure sprung,



<P>were well founded.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford was in love with Fanny.



<P>He had a pleasing anticipation of what would be.&nbsp; His niece,



<P>meanwhile, did not thank him for what he had just done.



<P>She had hoped to have William all to herself the last morning.



<P>It would have been an unspeakable indulgence.&nbsp; But though



<P>her wishes were overthrown, there was no spirit of murmuring



<P>within her.&nbsp; On the contrary, she was so totally unused



<P>to have her pleasure consulted, or to have anything take



<P>place at all in the way she could desire, that she was more



<P>disposed to wonder and rejoice in having carried her point



<P>so far, than to repine at the counteraction which followed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Shortly afterward, Sir Thomas was again interfering



<P>a little with her inclination, by advising her to go



<P>immediately to bed.&nbsp; "Advise" was his word, but it



<P>was the advice of absolute power, and she had only



<P>to rise, and, with Mr. Crawford's very cordial adieus,



<P>pass quietly away; stopping at the entrance-door, like



<P>the Lady of Branxholm Hall, "one moment and no more,"



<P>to view the happy scene, and take a last look at the five



<P>or six determined couple who were still hard at work;



<P>and then, creeping slowly up the principal staircase,



<P>pursued by the ceaseless country-dance, feverish with hopes



<P>and fears, soup and negus, sore-footed and fatigued,



<P>restless and agitated, yet feeling, in spite of everything,



<P>that a ball was indeed delightful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In thus sending her away, Sir Thomas perhaps might not



<P>be thinking merely of her health.&nbsp; It might occur to him



<P>that Mr. Crawford had been sitting by her long enough,



<P>or he might mean to recommend her as a wife by shewing



<P>her persuadableness.

<B>CHAPTER XIV</B>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Fanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed.



<P>The business of finding a play that would suit everybody



<P>proved to be no trifle; and the carpenter had received



<P>his orders and taken his measurements, had suggested



<P>and removed at least two sets of difficulties, and having



<P>made the necessity of an enlargement of plan and expense



<P>fully evident, was already at work, while a play was



<P>still to seek.&nbsp; Other preparations were also in hand.



<P>An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from Northampton,



<P>and been cut out by Mrs. Norris (with a saving by her



<P>good management of full three-quarters of a yard), and



<P>was actually forming into a curtain by the housemaids,



<P>and still the play was wanting; and as two or three days



<P>passed away in this manner, Edmund began almost to hope



<P>that none might ever be found.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There were, in fact, so many things to be attended to,



<P>so many people to be pleased, so many best characters



<P>required, and, above all, such a need that the play



<P>should be at once both tragedy and comedy, that there



<P>did seem as little chance of a decision as anything



<P>pursued by youth and zeal could hold out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the tragic side were the Miss Bertrams, Henry Crawford,



<P>and Mr. Yates; on the comic, Tom Bertram, not _quite_ alone,



<P>because it was evident that Mary Crawford's wishes,



<P>though politely kept back, inclined the same way:&nbsp; but his



<P>determinateness and his power seemed to make allies unnecessary;



<P>and, independent of this great irreconcilable difference,



<P>they wanted a piece containing very few characters



<P>in the whole, but every character first-rate, and three



<P>principal women.&nbsp; All the best plays were run over in vain.



<P>Neither Hamlet, nor Macbeth, nor Othello, nor Douglas,



<P>nor The Gamester, presented anything that could satisfy



<P>even the tragedians; and The Rivals, The School for Scandal,



<P>Wheel of Fortune, Heir at Law, and a long et cetera,



<P>were successively dismissed with yet warmer objections.



<P>No piece could be proposed that did not supply somebody



<P>with a difficulty, and on one side or the other it was



<P>a continual repetition of, "Oh no, _that_ will never do!



<P>Let us have no ranting tragedies.&nbsp; Too many characters.



<P>Not a tolerable woman's part in the play.&nbsp; Anything but _that_,



<P>my dear Tom.&nbsp; It would be impossible to fill it up.



<P>One could not expect anybody to take such a part.



<P>Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end.



<P>_That_ might do, perhaps, but for the low parts.&nbsp; If I



<P>_must_ give my opinion, I have always thought it the most



<P>insipid play in the English language.&nbsp; _I_ do not wish



<P>to make objections; I shall be happy to be of any use, but I



<P>think we could not chuse worse."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny looked on and listened, not unamused to observe



<P>the selfishness which, more or less disguised, seemed to



<P>govern them all, and wondering how it would end.&nbsp; For her



<P>own gratification she could have wished that something



<P>might be acted, for she had never seen even half a play,



<P>but everything of higher consequence was against it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This will never do," said Tom Bertram at last.&nbsp; "We are



<P>wasting time most abominably.&nbsp; Something must be fixed on.



<P>No matter what, so that something is chosen.&nbsp; We must not be



<P>so nice.&nbsp; A few characters too many must not frighten us.



<P>We must _double_ them.&nbsp; We must descend a little.



<P>If a part is insignificant, the greater our credit in making



<P>anything of it.&nbsp; From this moment I make no difficulties.



<P>I take any part you chuse to give me, so as it be comic.



<P>Let it but be comic, I condition for nothing more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For about the fifth time he then proposed the Heir at Law,



<P>doubting only whether to prefer Lord Duberley or Dr. Pangloss



<P>for himself; and very earnestly, but very unsuccessfully,



<P>trying to persuade the others that there were some fine



<P>tragic parts in the rest of the dramatis personae.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The pause which followed this fruitless effort



<P>was ended by the same speaker, who, taking up one



<P>of the many volumes of plays that lay on the table,



<P>and turning it over, suddenly exclaimed--"Lovers' Vows!



<P>And why should not Lovers' Vows do for _us_ as well



<P>as for the Ravenshaws?&nbsp; How came it never to be thought



<P>of before?&nbsp; It strikes me as if it would do exactly.



<P>What say you all?&nbsp; Here are two capital tragic parts for



<P>Yates and Crawford, and here is the rhyming Butler for me,



<P>if nobody else wants it; a trifling part, but the sort



<P>of thing I should not dislike, and, as I said before,



<P>I am determined to take anything and do my best.



<P>And as for the rest, they may be filled up by anybody.



<P>It is only Count Cassel and Anhalt."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The suggestion was generally welcome.&nbsp; Everybody was growing



<P>weary of indecision, and the first idea with everybody was,



<P>that nothing had been proposed before so likely to suit



<P>them all.&nbsp; Mr. Yates was particularly pleased:&nbsp; he had



<P>been sighing and longing to do the Baron at Ecclesford,



<P>had grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw's, and been forced



<P>to re-rant it all in his own room.&nbsp; The storm through Baron



<P>Wildenheim was the height of his theatrical ambition;



<P>and with the advantage of knowing half the scenes by



<P>heart already, he did now, with the greatest alacrity,



<P>offer his services for the part.&nbsp; To do him justice,



<P>however, he did not resolve to appropriate it;



<P>for remembering that there was some very good ranting-ground



<P>in Frederick, he professed an equal willingness for that.



<P>Henry Crawford was ready to take either.&nbsp; Whichever Mr. Yates



<P>did not chuse would perfectly satisfy him, and a short



<P>parley of compliment ensued.&nbsp; Miss Bertram, feeling all



<P>the interest of an Agatha in the question, took on her



<P>to decide it, by observing to Mr. Yates that this was a



<P>point in which height and figure ought to be considered,



<P>and that _his_ being the tallest, seemed to fit him



<P>peculiarly for the Baron.&nbsp; She was acknowledged to be



<P>quite right, and the two parts being accepted accordingly,



<P>she was certain of the proper Frederick.&nbsp; Three of the



<P>characters were now cast, besides Mr. Rushworth, who was



<P>always answered for by Maria as willing to do anything;



<P>when Julia, meaning, like her sister, to be Agatha,



<P>began to be scrupulous on Miss Crawford's account.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is not behaving well by the absent," said she.



<P>"Here are not women enough.&nbsp; Amelia and Agatha may do



<P>for Maria and me, but here is nothing for your sister,



<P>Mr. Crawford."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Crawford desired _that_ might not be thought of:



<P>he was very sure his sister had no wish of acting



<P>but as she might be useful, and that she would not



<P>allow herself to be considered in the present case.



<P>But this was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram,



<P>who asserted the part of Amelia to be in every respect



<P>the property of Miss Crawford, if she would accept it.



<P>"It falls as naturally, as necessarily to her," said he,



<P>"as Agatha does to one or other of my sisters.&nbsp; It can be no



<P>sacrifice on their side, for it is highly comic."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A short silence followed.&nbsp; Each sister looked anxious;



<P>for each felt the best claim to Agatha, and was hoping



<P>to have it pressed on her by the rest.&nbsp; Henry Crawford,



<P>who meanwhile had taken up the play, and with seeming



<P>carelessness was turning over the first act, soon settled



<P>the business.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I must entreat Miss _Julia_ Bertram," said he, "not to



<P>engage in the part of Agatha, or it will be the ruin



<P>of all my solemnity.&nbsp; You must not, indeed you must not"



<P>(turning to her). "I could not stand your countenance



<P>dressed up in woe and paleness.&nbsp; The many laughs we have



<P>had together would infallibly come across me, and Frederick



<P>and his knapsack would be obliged to run away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Pleasantly, courteously, it was spoken; but the



<P>manner was lost in the matter to Julia's feelings.



<P>She saw a glance at Maria which confirmed the injury



<P>to herself:&nbsp; it was a scheme, a trick; she was slighted,



<P>Maria was preferred; the smile of triumph which Maria



<P>was trying to suppress shewed how well it was understood;



<P>and before Julia could command herself enough to speak,



<P>her brother gave his weight against her too, by saying,



<P>"Oh yes!&nbsp; Maria must be Agatha.&nbsp; Maria will be the



<P>best Agatha.&nbsp; Though Julia fancies she prefers tragedy,



<P>I would not trust her in it.&nbsp; There is nothing of tragedy



<P>about her.&nbsp; She has not the look of it.&nbsp; Her features



<P>are not tragic features, and she walks too quick,



<P>and speaks too quick, and would not keep her countenance.



<P>She had better do the old countrywoman:&nbsp; the Cottager's wife;



<P>you had, indeed, Julia.&nbsp; Cottager's wife is a very pretty part,



<P>I assure you.&nbsp; The old lady relieves the high-flown



<P>benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit.



<P>You shall be Cottager's wife."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Cottager's wife!" cried Mr. Yates.&nbsp; "What are you



<P>talking of?&nbsp; The most trivial, paltry, insignificant part;



<P>the merest commonplace; not a tolerable speech in the whole.



<P>Your sister do that!&nbsp; It is an insult to propose it.



<P>At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it.



<P>We all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else.



<P>A little more justice, Mr. Manager, if you please.



<P>You do not deserve the office, if you cannot appreciate



<P>the talents of your company a little better."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, as to _that_, my good friend, till I and my company



<P>have really acted there must be some guesswork; but I mean



<P>no disparagement to Julia.&nbsp; We cannot have two Agathas,



<P>and we must have one Cottager's wife; and I am sure I set



<P>her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied



<P>with the old Butler.&nbsp; If the part is trifling she will



<P>have more credit in making something of it; and if she



<P>is so desperately bent against everything humorous,



<P>let her take Cottager's speeches instead of Cottager's



<P>wife's, and so change the parts all through; _he_ is



<P>solemn and pathetic enough, I am sure.&nbsp; It could make



<P>no difference in the play, and as for Cottager himself,



<P>when he has got his wife's speeches, _I_ would undertake



<P>him with all my heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"With all your partiality for Cottager's wife,"



<P>said Henry Crawford, "it will be impossible to make



<P>anything of it fit for your sister, and we must not suffer



<P>her good-nature to be imposed on.&nbsp; We must not _allow_



<P>her to accept the part.&nbsp; She must not be left to her



<P>own complaisance.&nbsp; Her talents will be wanted in Amelia.



<P>Amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented



<P>than even Agatha.&nbsp; I consider Amelia is the most difficult



<P>character in the whole piece.&nbsp; It requires great powers,



<P>great nicety, to give her playfulness and simplicity



<P>without extravagance.&nbsp; I have seen good actresses fail



<P>in the part.&nbsp; Simplicity, indeed, is beyond the reach



<P>of almost every actress by profession.&nbsp; It requires



<P>a delicacy of feeling which they have not.&nbsp; It requires



<P>a gentlewoman--a Julia Bertram.&nbsp; You _will_ undertake it,



<P>I hope?" turning to her with a look of anxious entreaty,



<P>which softened her a little; but while she hesitated



<P>what to say, her brother again interposed with Miss



<P>Crawford's better claim.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no, Julia must not be Amelia.&nbsp; It is not at



<P>all the part for her.&nbsp; She would not like it.



<P>She would not do well.&nbsp; She is too tall and robust.



<P>Amelia should be a small, light, girlish, skipping figure.



<P>It is fit for Miss Crawford, and Miss Crawford only.



<P>She looks the part, and I am persuaded will do it admirably."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Without attending to this, Henry Crawford continued



<P>his supplication.&nbsp; "You must oblige us," said he,



<P>"indeed you must.&nbsp; When you have studied the character, I am



<P>sure you will feel it suit you.&nbsp; Tragedy may be your choice,



<P>but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses _you_.



<P>You will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions;



<P>you will not refuse to visit me in prison?&nbsp; I think I



<P>see you coming in with your basket"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The influence of his voice was felt.&nbsp; Julia wavered;



<P>but was he only trying to soothe and pacify her, and make



<P>her overlook the previous affront?&nbsp; She distrusted him.



<P>The slight had been most determined.&nbsp; He was, perhaps,



<P>but at treacherous play with her.&nbsp; She looked suspiciously



<P>at her sister; Maria's countenance was to decide it:



<P>if she were vexed and alarmed--but Maria looked all



<P>serenity and satisfaction, and Julia well knew that on



<P>this ground Maria could not be happy but at her expense.



<P>With hasty indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice,



<P>she said to him, "You do not seem afraid of not



<P>keeping your countenance when I come in with a basket



<P>of provisions--though one might have supposed--but it



<P>is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering!"



<P>She stopped--Henry Crawford looked rather foolish,



<P>and as if he did not know what to say.&nbsp; Tom Bertram



<P>began again--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Crawford must be Amelia.&nbsp; She will be an excellent Amelia."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do not be afraid of _my_ wanting the character,"



<P>cried Julia, with angry quickness:&nbsp; "I am _not_ to be Agatha,



<P>and I am sure I will do nothing else; and as to Amelia,



<P>it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me.



<P>I quite detest her.&nbsp; An odious, little, pert, unnatural,



<P>impudent girl.&nbsp; I have always protested against comedy,



<P>and this is comedy in its worst form."&nbsp; And so saying,



<P>she walked hastily out of the room, leaving awkward feelings



<P>to more than one, but exciting small compassion in any



<P>except Fanny, who had been a quiet auditor of the whole,



<P>and who could not think of her as under the agitations of



<P>_jealousy_ without great pity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A short silence succeeded her leaving them; but her brother



<P>soon returned to business and Lovers' Vows, and was



<P>eagerly looking over the play, with Mr. Yates's help,



<P>to ascertain what scenery would be necessary--while Maria



<P>and Henry Crawford conversed together in an under-voice,



<P>and the declaration with which she began of, "I am



<P>sure I would give up the part to Julia most willingly,



<P>but that though I shall probably do it very ill,



<P>I feel persuaded _she_ would do it worse," was doubtless



<P>receiving all the compliments it called for.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When this had lasted some time, the division of the party



<P>was completed by Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off



<P>together to consult farther in the room now beginning



<P>to be called _the_ _Theatre_, and Miss Bertram's resolving



<P>to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer



<P>of Amelia to Miss Crawford; and Fanny remained alone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The first use she made of her solitude was to take up



<P>the volume which had been left on the table, and begin



<P>to acquaint herself with the play of which she had heard



<P>so much.&nbsp; Her curiosity was all awake, and she ran



<P>through it with an eagerness which was suspended only



<P>by intervals of astonishment, that it could be chosen



<P>in the present instance, that it could be proposed



<P>and accepted in a private theatre!&nbsp; Agatha and Amelia



<P>appeared to her in their different ways so totally



<P>improper for home representation--the situation of one,



<P>and the language of the other, so unfit to be expressed



<P>by any woman of modesty, that she could hardly suppose



<P>her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging in;



<P>and longed to have them roused as soon as possible



<P>by the remonstrance which Edmund would certainly make.

<B>CHAPTER XXXVIII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The novelty of travelling, and the happiness of being



<P>with William, soon produced their natural effect on



<P>Fanny's spirits, when Mansfield Park was fairly left behind;



<P>and by the time their first stage was ended, and they



<P>were to quit Sir Thomas's carriage, she was able to take



<P>leave of the old coachman, and send back proper messages,



<P>with cheerful looks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of pleasant talk between the brother and sister there



<P>was no end.&nbsp; Everything supplied an amusement to the high



<P>glee of William's mind, and he was full of frolic and



<P>joke in the intervals of their higher-toned subjects,



<P>all of which ended, if they did not begin, in praise



<P>of the Thrush, conjectures how she would be employed,



<P>schemes for an action with some superior force,



<P>which (supposing the first lieutenant out of the way,



<P>and William was not very merciful to the first lieutenant)



<P>was to give himself the next step as soon as possible,



<P>or speculations upon prize-money, which was to be generously



<P>distributed at home, with only the reservation of enough



<P>to make the little cottage comfortable, in which he and Fanny



<P>were to pass all their middle and later life together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's immediate concerns, as far as they involved



<P>Mr. Crawford, made no part of their conversation.



<P>William knew what had passed, and from his heart lamented



<P>that his sister's feelings should be so cold towards a man



<P>whom he must consider as the first of human characters;



<P>but he was of an age to be all for love, and therefore



<P>unable to blame; and knowing her wish on the subject,



<P>he would not distress her by the slightest allusion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had reason to suppose herself not yet forgotten by



<P>Mr. Crawford.&nbsp; She had heard repeatedly from his sister within



<P>the three weeks which had passed since their leaving Mansfield,



<P>and in each letter there had been a few lines from himself,



<P>warm and determined like his speeches.&nbsp; It was a correspondence



<P>which Fanny found quite as unpleasant as she had feared.



<P>Miss Crawford's style of writing, lively and affectionate,



<P>was itself an evil, independent of what she was thus



<P>forced into reading from the brother's pen, for Edmund



<P>would never rest till she had read the chief of the letter



<P>to him; and then she had to listen to his admiration



<P>of her language, and the warmth of her attachments.



<P>There had, in fact, been so much of message, of allusion,



<P>of recollection, so much of Mansfield in every letter,



<P>that Fanny could not but suppose it meant for him to hear;



<P>and to find herself forced into a purpose of that kind,



<P>compelled into a correspondence which was bringing her



<P>the addresses of the man she did not love, and obliging



<P>her to administer to the adverse passion of the man she did,



<P>was cruelly mortifying.&nbsp; Here, too, her present removal



<P>promised advantage.&nbsp; When no longer under the same roof



<P>with Edmund, she trusted that Miss Crawford would have no



<P>motive for writing strong enough to overcome the trouble,



<P>and that at Portsmouth their correspondence would dwindle



<P>into nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With such thoughts as these, among ten hundred others,



<P>Fanny proceeded in her journey safely and cheerfully,



<P>and as expeditiously as could rationally be hoped



<P>in the dirty month of February.&nbsp; They entered Oxford,



<P>but she could take only a hasty glimpse of Edmund's



<P>college as they passed along, and made no stop anywhere



<P>till they reached Newbury, where a comfortable meal,



<P>uniting dinner and supper, wound up the enjoyments and



<P>fatigues of the day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The next morning saw them off again at an early hour;



<P>and with no events, and no delays, they regularly advanced,



<P>and were in the environs of Portsmouth while there was yet



<P>daylight for Fanny to look around her, and wonder at the



<P>new buildings.&nbsp; They passed the drawbridge, and entered



<P>the town; and the light was only beginning to fail as,



<P>guided by William's powerful voice, they were rattled



<P>into a narrow street, leading from the High Street,



<P>and drawn up before the door of a small house now inhabited



<P>by Mr. Price.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was all agitation and flutter; all hope and apprehension.



<P>The moment they stopped, a trollopy-looking maidservant,



<P>seemingly in waiting for them at the door, stepped forward,



<P>and more intent on telling the news than giving them any help,



<P>immediately began with, "The Thrush is gone out of harbour,



<P>please sir, and one of the officers has been here to--



<P>" She was interrupted by a fine tall boy of eleven years old,



<P>who, rushing out of the house, pushed the maid aside,



<P>and while William was opening the chaise-door himself,



<P>called out, "You are just in time.&nbsp; We have been looking



<P>for you this half-hour. The Thrush went out of harbour



<P>this morning.&nbsp; I saw her.&nbsp; It was a beautiful sight.



<P>And they think she will have her orders in a day or two.



<P>And Mr. Campbell was here at four o'clock to ask for you:



<P>he has got one of the Thrush's boats, and is going off



<P>to her at six, and hoped you would be here in time to go



<P>with him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A stare or two at Fanny, as William helped her out of



<P>the carriage, was all the voluntary notice which this



<P>brother bestowed; but he made no objection to her



<P>kissing him, though still entirely engaged in detailing



<P>farther particulars of the Thrush's going out of harbour,



<P>in which he had a strong right of interest, being to



<P>commence his career of seamanship in her at this very time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another moment and Fanny was in the narrow entrance-passage



<P>of the house, and in her mother's arms, who met her



<P>there with looks of true kindness, and with features



<P>which Fanny loved the more, because they brought her aunt



<P>Bertram's before her, and there were her two sisters:



<P>Susan, a well-grown fine girl of fourteen, and Betsey,



<P>the youngest of the family, about five--both glad to see



<P>her in their way, though with no advantage of manner



<P>in receiving her.&nbsp; But manner Fanny did not want.



<P>Would they but love her, she should be satisfied.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was then taken into a parlour, so small that her



<P>first conviction was of its being only a passage-room



<P>to something better, and she stood for a moment expecting



<P>to be invited on; but when she saw there was no other door,



<P>and that there were signs of habitation before her,



<P>she called back her thoughts, reproved herself, and grieved



<P>lest they should have been suspected.&nbsp; Her mother,



<P>however, could not stay long enough to suspect anything.



<P>She was gone again to the street-door, to welcome William.



<P>"Oh! my dear William, how glad I am to see you.



<P>But have you heard about the Thrush?&nbsp; She is gone out of



<P>harbour already; three days before we had any thought of it;



<P>and I do not know what I am to do about Sam's things,



<P>they will never be ready in time; for she may have her orders



<P>to-morrow, perhaps.&nbsp; It takes me quite unawares.&nbsp; And now



<P>you must be off for Spithead too.&nbsp; Campbell has been here,



<P>quite in a worry about you; and now what shall we do?



<P>I thought to have had such a comfortable evening with you,



<P>and here everything comes upon me at once."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her son answered cheerfully, telling her that everything



<P>was always for the best; and making light of his own



<P>inconvenience in being obliged to hurry away so soon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure, I had much rather she had stayed in harbour,



<P>that I might have sat a few hours with you in comfort;



<P>but as there is a boat ashore, I had better go off at once,



<P>and there is no help for it.&nbsp; Whereabouts does the Thrush



<P>lay at Spithead?&nbsp; Near the Canopus?&nbsp; But no matter;



<P>here's Fanny in the parlour, and why should we stay in



<P>the passage?&nbsp; Come, mother, you have hardly looked at your



<P>own dear Fanny yet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In they both came, and Mrs. Price having kindly kissed



<P>her daughter again, and commented a little on her growth,



<P>began with very natural solicitude to feel for their



<P>fatigues and wants as travellers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor dears! how tired you must both be! and now,



<P>what will you have?&nbsp; I began to think you would never come.



<P>Betsey and I have been watching for you this half-hour.



<P>And when did you get anything to eat?&nbsp; And what would you



<P>like to have now?&nbsp; I could not tell whether you would be



<P>for some meat, or only a dish of tea, after your journey,



<P>or else I would have got something ready.&nbsp; And now I



<P>am afraid Campbell will be here before there is time



<P>to dress a steak, and we have no butcher at hand.



<P>It is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street.



<P>We were better off in our last house.&nbsp; Perhaps you would



<P>like some tea as soon as it can be got."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They both declared they should prefer it to anything.



<P>"Then, Betsey, my dear, run into the kitchen and see if Rebecca



<P>has put the water on; and tell her to bring in the tea-things



<P>as soon as she can.&nbsp; I wish we could get the bell mended;



<P>but Betsey is a very handy little messenger."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Betsey went with alacrity, proud to shew her abilities



<P>before her fine new sister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear me!" continued the anxious mother, "what a sad



<P>fire we have got, and I dare say you are both starved



<P>with cold.&nbsp; Draw your chair nearer, my dear.&nbsp; I cannot



<P>think what Rebecca has been about.&nbsp; I am sure I told her



<P>to bring some coals half an hour ago.&nbsp; Susan, you should



<P>have taken care of the fire."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was upstairs, mama, moving my things," said Susan,



<P>in a fearless, self-defending tone, which startled Fanny.



<P>"You know you had but just settled that my sister Fanny



<P>and I should have the other room; and I could not get



<P>Rebecca to give me any help."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Farther discussion was prevented by various bustles:



<P>first, the driver came to be paid; then there was a squabble



<P>between Sam and Rebecca about the manner of carrying up



<P>his sister's trunk, which he would manage all his own way;



<P>and lastly, in walked Mr. Price himself, his own loud



<P>voice preceding him, as with something of the oath kind



<P>he kicked away his son's port-manteau and his daughter's



<P>bandbox in the passage, and called out for a candle;



<P>no candle was brought, however, and he walked into the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny with doubting feelings had risen to meet him,



<P>but sank down again on finding herself undistinguished



<P>in the dusk, and unthought of.&nbsp; With a friendly shake



<P>of his son's hand, and an eager voice, he instantly began--



<P>"Ha! welcome back, my boy.&nbsp; Glad to see you.&nbsp; Have you heard



<P>the news?&nbsp; The Thrush went out of harbour this morning.



<P>Sharp is the word, you see!&nbsp; By G--, you are just in time!



<P>The doctor has been here inquiring for you:&nbsp; he has got



<P>one of the boats, and is to be off for Spithead by six,



<P>so you had better go with him.&nbsp; I have been to Turner's



<P>about your mess; it is all in a way to be done.



<P>I should not wonder if you had your orders to-morrow:



<P>but you cannot sail with this wind, if you are to cruise



<P>to the westward; and Captain Walsh thinks you will certainly



<P>have a cruise to the westward, with the Elephant.



<P>By G--, I wish you may!&nbsp; But old Scholey was saying,



<P>just now, that he thought you would be sent first to



<P>the Texel.&nbsp; Well, well, we are ready, whatever happens.



<P>But by G--, you lost a fine sight by not being here



<P>in the morning to see the Thrush go out of harbour!



<P>I would not have been out of the way for a thousand pounds.



<P>Old Scholey ran in at breakfast-time, to say she had



<P>slipped her moorings and was coming out, I jumped up,



<P>and made but two steps to the platform.&nbsp; If ever there



<P>was a perfect beauty afloat, she is one; and there she lays



<P>at Spithead, and anybody in England would take her for an



<P>eight-and-twenty. I was upon the platform two hours this



<P>afternoon looking at her.&nbsp; She lays close to the Endymion,



<P>between her and the Cleopatra, just to the eastward of the



<P>sheer hulk."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ha!" cried William, "_that's_ just where I should have



<P>put her myself.&nbsp; It's the best berth at Spithead.



<P>But here is my sister, sir; here is Fanny," turning and



<P>leading her forward; "it is so dark you do not see her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With an acknowledgment that he had quite forgot her,



<P>Mr. Price now received his daughter; and having given



<P>her a cordial hug, and observed that she was grown into



<P>a woman, and he supposed would be wanting a husband soon,



<P>seemed very much inclined to forget her again.



<P>Fanny shrunk back to her seat, with feelings sadly



<P>pained by his language and his smell of spirits;



<P>and he talked on only to his son, and only of the Thrush,



<P>though William, warmly interested as he was in that subject,



<P>more than once tried to make his father think of Fanny,



<P>and her long absence and long journey.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After sitting some time longer, a candle was obtained;



<P>but as there was still no appearance of tea, nor, from



<P>Betsey's reports from the kitchen, much hope of any under



<P>a considerable period, William determined to go and change



<P>his dress, and make the necessary preparations for his removal



<P>on board directly, that he might have his tea in comfort



<P>afterwards.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he left the room, two rosy-faced boys, ragged and dirty,



<P>about eight and nine years old, rushed into it just released



<P>from school, and coming eagerly to see their sister,



<P>and tell that the Thrush was gone out of harbour;



<P>Tom and Charles.&nbsp; Charles had been born since Fanny's



<P>going away, but Tom she had often helped to nurse,



<P>and now felt a particular pleasure in seeing again.



<P>Both were kissed very tenderly, but Tom she wanted



<P>to keep by her, to try to trace the features of the baby



<P>she had loved, and talked to, of his infant preference



<P>of herself.&nbsp; Tom, however, had no mind for such treatment:



<P>he came home not to stand and be talked to, but to run about



<P>and make a noise; and both boys had soon burst from her,



<P>and slammed the parlour-door till her temples ached.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had now seen all that were at home; there remained



<P>only two brothers between herself and Susan,



<P>one of whom was a clerk in a public office in London,



<P>and the other midshipman on board an Indiaman.



<P>But though she had _seen_ all the members of the family,



<P>she had not yet _heard_ all the noise they could make.



<P>Another quarter of an hour brought her a great deal more.



<P>William was soon calling out from the landing-place



<P>of the second story for his mother and for Rebecca.



<P>He was in distress for something that he had left there,



<P>and did not find again.&nbsp; A key was mislaid, Betsey accused



<P>of having got at his new hat, and some slight, but essential



<P>alteration of his uniform waistcoat, which he had been



<P>promised to have done for him, entirely neglected.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Price, Rebecca, and Betsey all went up to defend themselves,



<P>all talking together, but Rebecca loudest, and the job



<P>was to be done as well as it could in a great hurry;



<P>William trying in vain to send Betsey down again, or keep



<P>her from being troublesome where she was; the whole of which,



<P>as almost every door in the house was open, could be plainly



<P>distinguished in the parlour, except when drowned at intervals



<P>by the superior noise of Sam, Tom, and Charles chasing



<P>each other up and down stairs, and tumbling about and hallooing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was almost stunned.&nbsp; The smallness of the house



<P>and thinness of the walls brought everything so close



<P>to her, that, added to the fatigue of her journey, and all



<P>her recent agitation, she hardly knew how to bear it.



<P>_Within_ the room all was tranquil enough, for Susan having



<P>disappeared with the others, there were soon only her father



<P>and herself remaining; and he, taking out a newspaper,



<P>the accustomary loan of a neighbour, applied himself to



<P>studying it, without seeming to recollect her existence.



<P>The solitary candle was held between himself and the paper,



<P>without any reference to her possible convenience;



<P>but she had nothing to do, and was glad to have the light



<P>screened from her aching head, as she sat in bewildered,



<P>broken, sorrowful contemplation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was at home.&nbsp; But, alas! it was not such a home,



<P>she had not such a welcome, as--she checked herself;



<P>she was unreasonable.&nbsp; What right had she to be of importance



<P>to her family?&nbsp; She could have none, so long lost sight of!



<P>William's concerns must be dearest, they always had been,



<P>and he had every right.&nbsp; Yet to have so little said



<P>or asked about herself, to have scarcely an inquiry made



<P>after Mansfield!&nbsp; It did pain her to have Mansfield forgotten;



<P>the friends who had done so much--the dear, dear friends!



<P>But here, one subject swallowed up all the rest.



<P>Perhaps it must be so.&nbsp; The destination of the Thrush



<P>must be now preeminently interesting.&nbsp; A day or two



<P>might shew the difference.&nbsp; _She_ only was to blame.



<P>Yet she thought it would not have been so at Mansfield.



<P>No, in her uncle's house there would have been a



<P>consideration of times and seasons, a regulation of subject,



<P>a propriety, an attention towards everybody which there



<P>was not here.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The only interruption which thoughts like these received



<P>for nearly half an hour was from a sudden burst of her



<P>father's, not at all calculated to compose them.&nbsp; At a more



<P>than ordinary pitch of thumping and hallooing in the passage,



<P>he exclaimed, "Devil take those young dogs!&nbsp; How they are



<P>singing out!&nbsp; Ay, Sam's voice louder than all the rest!



<P>That boy is fit for a boatswain.&nbsp; Holla, you there!



<P>Sam, stop your confounded pipe, or I shall be after you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This threat was so palpably disregarded, that though



<P>within five minutes afterwards the three boys all burst



<P>into the room together and sat down, Fanny could not



<P>consider it as a proof of anything more than their being



<P>for the time thoroughly fagged, which their hot faces



<P>and panting breaths seemed to prove, especially as they



<P>were still kicking each other's shins, and hallooing



<P>out at sudden starts immediately under their father's eye.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The next opening of the door brought something more welcome:



<P>it was for the tea-things, which she had begun almost



<P>to despair of seeing that evening.&nbsp; Susan and an



<P>attendant girl, whose inferior appearance informed Fanny,



<P>to her great surprise, that she had previously seen the



<P>upper servant, brought in everything necessary for the meal;



<P>Susan looking, as she put the kettle on the fire and glanced



<P>at her sister, as if divided between the agreeable triumph



<P>of shewing her activity and usefulness, and the dread



<P>of being thought to demean herself by such an office.



<P>"She had been into the kitchen," she said, "to hurry Sally



<P>and help make the toast, and spread the bread and butter,



<P>or she did not know when they should have got tea,



<P>and she was sure her sister must want something after



<P>her journey."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was very thankful.&nbsp; She could not but own that she



<P>should be very glad of a little tea, and Susan immediately



<P>set about making it, as if pleased to have the employment



<P>all to herself; and with only a little unnecessary bustle,



<P>and some few injudicious attempts at keeping her brothers



<P>in better order than she could, acquitted herself very well.



<P>Fanny's spirit was as much refreshed as her body; her head



<P>and heart were soon the better for such well-timed kindness.



<P>Susan had an open, sensible countenance; she was like William,



<P>and Fanny hoped to find her like him in disposition



<P>and goodwill towards herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In this more placid state of things William reentered,



<P>followed not far behind by his mother and Betsey.



<P>He, complete in his lieutenant's uniform, looking and



<P>moving all the taller, firmer, and more graceful for it,



<P>and with the happiest smile over his face, walked up directly



<P>to Fanny, who, rising from her seat, looked at him for a



<P>moment in speechless admiration, and then threw her arms



<P>round his neck to sob out her various emotions of pain and



<P>pleasure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anxious not to appear unhappy, she soon recovered herself;



<P>and wiping away her tears, was able to notice and admire



<P>all the striking parts of his dress; listening with reviving



<P>spirits to his cheerful hopes of being on shore some part



<P>of every day before they sailed, and even of getting



<P>her to Spithead to see the sloop.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The next bustle brought in Mr. Campbell, the surgeon



<P>of the Thrush, a very well-behaved young man, who came



<P>to call for his friend, and for whom there was with some



<P>contrivance found a chair, and with some hasty washing of



<P>the young tea-maker's, a cup and saucer; and after another



<P>quarter of an hour of earnest talk between the gentlemen,



<P>noise rising upon noise, and bustle upon bustle, men and



<P>boys at last all in motion together, the moment came



<P>for setting off; everything was ready, William took leave,



<P>and all of them were gone; for the three boys, in spite



<P>of their mother's entreaty, determined to see their brother



<P>and Mr. Campbell to the sally-port; and Mr. Price walked



<P>off at the same time to carry back his neighbour's newspaper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Something like tranquillity might now be hoped for;



<P>and accordingly, when Rebecca had been prevailed on



<P>to carry away the tea-things, and Mrs. Price had walked



<P>about the room some time looking for a shirt-sleeve, which



<P>Betsey at last hunted out from a drawer in the kitchen,



<P>the small party of females were pretty well composed,



<P>and the mother having lamented again over the impossibility



<P>of getting Sam ready in time, was at leisure to think



<P>of her eldest daughter and the friends she had come from.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A few inquiries began:&nbsp; but one of the earliest--"How did



<P>sister Bertram manage about her servants?&nbsp; "Was she



<P>as much plagued as herself to get tolerable servants?"--



<P>soon led her mind away from Northamptonshire, and fixed it



<P>on her own domestic grievances, and the shocking character



<P>of all the Portsmouth servants, of whom she believed her



<P>own two were the very worst, engrossed her completely.



<P>The Bertrams were all forgotten in detailing the faults



<P>of Rebecca, against whom Susan had also much to depose,



<P>and little Betsey a great deal more, and who did seem



<P>so thoroughly without a single recommendation, that Fanny



<P>could not help modestly presuming that her mother meant



<P>to part with her when her year was up.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Her year!" cried Mrs. Price; "I am sure I hope I



<P>shall be rid of her before she has staid a year,



<P>for that will not be up till November.&nbsp; Servants are come



<P>to such a pass, my dear, in Portsmouth, that it is quite



<P>a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year.



<P>I have no hope of ever being settled; and if I was to



<P>part with Rebecca, I should only get something worse.



<P>And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress



<P>to please; and I am sure the place is easy enough,



<P>for there is always a girl under her, and I often do half



<P>the work myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was silent; but not from being convinced that there



<P>might not be a remedy found for some of these evils.



<P>As she now sat looking at Betsey, she could not but think



<P>particularly of another sister, a very pretty little girl,



<P>whom she had left there not much younger when she went



<P>into Northamptonshire, who had died a few years afterwards.



<P>There had been something remarkably amiable about her.



<P>Fanny in those early days had preferred her to Susan;



<P>and when the news of her death had at last reached Mansfield,



<P>had for a short time been quite afflicted.&nbsp; The sight



<P>of Betsey brought the image of little Mary back again,



<P>but she would not have pained her mother by alluding to her



<P>for the world.&nbsp; While considering her with these ideas,



<P>Betsey, at a small distance, was holding out something to



<P>catch her eyes, meaning to screen it at the same time from



<P>Susan's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What have you got there, my love?" said Fanny;



<P>"come and shew it to me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a silver knife.&nbsp; Up jumped Susan, claiming it



<P>as her own, and trying to get it away; but the child ran



<P>to her mother's protection, and Susan could only reproach,



<P>which she did very warmly, and evidently hoping to



<P>interest Fanny on her side.&nbsp; "It was very hard that she



<P>was not to have her _own_ knife; it was her own knife;



<P>little sister Mary had left it to her upon her deathbed,



<P>and she ought to have had it to keep herself long ago.



<P>But mama kept it from her, and was always letting Betsey



<P>get hold of it; and the end of it would be that Betsey



<P>would spoil it, and get it for her own, though mama



<P>had _promised_ her that Betsey should not have it in her



<P>own hands."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was quite shocked.&nbsp; Every feeling of duty,



<P>honour, and tenderness was wounded by her sister's



<P>speech and her mother's reply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, Susan," cried Mrs. Price, in a complaining voice,



<P>"now, how can you be so cross?&nbsp; You are always quarrelling



<P>about that knife.&nbsp; I wish you would not be so quarrelsome.



<P>Poor little Betsey; how cross Susan is to you!&nbsp; But you



<P>should not have taken it out, my dear, when I sent you



<P>to the drawer.&nbsp; You know I told you not to touch it,



<P>because Susan is so cross about it.&nbsp; I must hide it



<P>another time, Betsey.&nbsp; Poor Mary little thought it would



<P>be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to keep,



<P>only two hours before she died.&nbsp; Poor little soul! she could



<P>but just speak to be heard, and she said so prettily, "Let sister



<P>Susan have my knife, mama, when I am dead and buried."



<P>Poor little dear! she was so fond of it, Fanny, that she



<P>would have it lay by her in bed, all through her illness.



<P>It was the gift of her good godmother, old Mrs. Admiral



<P>Maxwell, only six weeks before she was taken for death.



<P>Poor little sweet creature!&nbsp; Well, she was taken away



<P>from evil to come.&nbsp; My own Betsey" (fondling her),



<P>"_you_ have not the luck of such a good godmother.



<P>Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little



<P>people as you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny had indeed nothing to convey from aunt Norris,



<P>but a message to say she hoped that her god-daughter



<P>was a good girl, and learnt her book.&nbsp; There had been



<P>at one moment a slight murmur in the drawing-room



<P>at Mansfield Park about sending her a prayer-book;



<P>but no second sound had been heard of such a purpose.



<P>Mrs. Norris, however, had gone home and taken down two



<P>old prayer-books of her husband with that idea; but,



<P>upon examination, the ardour of generosity went off.



<P>One was found to have too small a print for a child's eyes,



<P>and the other to be too cumbersome for her to carry about.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, fatigued and fatigued again, was thankful to accept



<P>the first invitation of going to bed; and before Betsey



<P>had finished her cry at being allowed to sit up only one



<P>hour extraordinary in honour of sister, she was off,



<P>leaving all below in confusion and noise again; the boys



<P>begging for toasted cheese, her father calling out for his



<P>rum and water, and Rebecca never where she ought to be.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was nothing to raise her spirits in the confined



<P>and scantily furnished chamber that she was to share



<P>with Susan.&nbsp; The smallness of the rooms above and below,



<P>indeed, and the narrowness of the passage and staircase,



<P>struck her beyond her imagination.&nbsp; She soon learned to think



<P>with respect of her own little attic at Mansfield Park,



<P>in&nbsp; that&nbsp; house reckoned too small for anybody's comfort.

<B>CHAPTER IV</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Tom Bertram had of late spent so little of his time at



<P>home that he could be only nominally missed; and Lady



<P>Bertram was soon astonished to find how very well they



<P>did even without his father, how well Edmund could



<P>supply his place in carving, talking to the steward,



<P>writing to the attorney, settling with the servants,



<P>and equally saving her from all possible fatigue or exertion



<P>in every particular but that of directing her letters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The earliest intelligence of the travellers' safe arrival



<P>at Antigua, after a favourable voyage, was received;



<P>though not before Mrs. Norris had been indulging in very



<P>dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmund participate them



<P>whenever she could get him alone; and as she depended



<P>on being the first person made acquainted with any



<P>fatal catastrophe, she had already arranged the manner of



<P>breaking it to all the others, when Sir Thomas's assurances



<P>of their both being alive and well made it necessary to lay



<P>by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches for a while.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The winter came and passed without their being



<P>called for; the accounts continued perfectly good;



<P>and Mrs. Norris, in promoting gaieties for her nieces,



<P>assisting their toilets, displaying their accomplishments,



<P>and looking about for their future husbands, had so much



<P>to do as, in addition to all her own household cares,



<P>some interference in those of her sister, and Mrs. Grant's



<P>wasteful doings to overlook, left her very little occasion



<P>to be occupied in fears for the absent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Miss Bertrams were now fully established among the



<P>belles of the neighbourhood; and as they joined to beauty



<P>and brilliant acquirements a manner naturally easy,



<P>and carefully formed to general civility and obligingness,



<P>they possessed its favour as well as its admiration.



<P>Their vanity was in such good order that they seemed



<P>to be quite free from it, and gave themselves no airs;



<P>while the praises attending such behaviour, secured and



<P>brought round by their aunt, served to strengthen them in



<P>believing they had no faults.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Bertram did not go into public with her daughters.



<P>She was too indolent even to accept a mother's gratification



<P>in witnessing their success and enjoyment at the expense



<P>of any personal trouble, and the charge was made over



<P>to her sister, who desired nothing better than a post



<P>of such honourable representation, and very thoroughly



<P>relished the means it afforded her of mixing in society



<P>without having horses to hire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny had no share in the festivities of the season;



<P>but she enjoyed being avowedly useful as her aunt's companion



<P>when they called away the rest of the family; and, as Miss



<P>Lee had left Mansfield, she naturally became everything



<P>to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or a party.



<P>She talked to her, listened to her, read to her;



<P>and the tranquillity of such evenings, her perfect security



<P>in such a _tete-a-tete_ from any sound of unkindness,



<P>was unspeakably welcome to a mind which had seldom



<P>known a pause in its alarms or embarrassments.&nbsp; As to



<P>her cousins' gaieties, she loved to hear an account of them,



<P>especially of the balls, and whom Edmund had danced with;



<P>but thought too lowly of her own situation to imagine



<P>she should ever be admitted to the same, and listened,



<P>therefore, without an idea of any nearer concern in them.



<P>Upon the whole, it was a comfortable winter to her;



<P>for though it brought no William to England, the never-failing



<P>hope of his arrival was worth much.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The ensuing spring deprived her of her valued friend,



<P>the old grey pony; and for some time she was in danger of



<P>feeling the loss in her health as well as in her affections;



<P>for in spite of the acknowledged importance of her riding



<P>on horse-back, no measures were taken for mounting



<P>her again, "because," as it was observed by her aunts,



<P>"she might ride one of her cousin's horses at any time



<P>when they did not want them," and as the Miss Bertrams



<P>regularly wanted their horses every fine day, and had no



<P>idea of carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice



<P>of any real pleasure, that time, of course, never came.



<P>They took their cheerful rides in the fine mornings



<P>of April and May; and Fanny either sat at home the whole



<P>day with one aunt, or walked beyond her strength at the



<P>instigation of the other:&nbsp; Lady Bertram holding exercise



<P>to be as unnecessary for everybody as it was unpleasant



<P>to herself; and Mrs. Norris, who was walking all day,



<P>thinking everybody ought to walk as much.&nbsp; Edmund was absent



<P>at this time, or the evil would have been earlier remedied.



<P>When he returned, to understand how Fanny was situated,



<P>and perceived its ill effects, there seemed with him but



<P>one thing to be done; and that "Fanny must have a horse"



<P>was the resolute declaration with which he opposed



<P>whatever could be urged by the supineness of his mother,



<P>or the economy of his aunt, to make it appear unimportant.



<P>Mrs. Norris could not help thinking that some steady



<P>old thing might be found among the numbers belonging



<P>to the Park that would do vastly well; or that one might



<P>be borrowed of the steward; or that perhaps Dr. Grant



<P>might now and then lend them the pony he sent to the post.



<P>She could not but consider it as absolutely unnecessary,



<P>and even improper, that Fanny should have a regular



<P>lady's horse of her own, in the style of her cousins.



<P>She was sure Sir Thomas had never intended it:&nbsp; and she



<P>must say that, to be making such a purchase in his absence,



<P>and adding to the great expenses of his stable,



<P>at a time when a large part of his income was unsettled,



<P>seemed to her very unjustifiable.&nbsp; "Fanny must have



<P>a horse," was Edmund's only reply.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris could



<P>not see it in the same light.&nbsp; Lady Bertram did:



<P>she entirely agreed with her son as to the necessity of it,



<P>and as to its being considered necessary by his father;



<P>she only pleaded against there being any hurry; she only



<P>wanted him to wait till Sir Thomas's return, and then Sir



<P>Thomas might settle it all himself.&nbsp; He would be at home



<P>in September, and where would be the harm of only waiting



<P>till September?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Though Edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than



<P>with his mother, as evincing least regard for her niece,



<P>he could not help paying more attention to what she said;



<P>and at length determined on a method of proceeding



<P>which would obviate the risk of his father's thinking he



<P>had done too much, and at the same time procure for Fanny



<P>the immediate means of exercise, which he could not bear



<P>she should be without.&nbsp; He had three horses of his own,



<P>but not one that would carry a woman.&nbsp; Two of them



<P>were hunters; the third, a useful road-horse: this third he



<P>resolved to exchange for one that his cousin might ride;



<P>he knew where such a one was to be met with; and having once



<P>made up his mind, the whole business was soon completed.



<P>The new mare proved a treasure; with a very little



<P>trouble she became exactly calculated for the purpose,



<P>and Fanny was then put in almost full possession of her.



<P>She had not supposed before that anything could ever suit



<P>her like the old grey pony; but her delight in Edmund's



<P>mare was far beyond any former pleasure of the sort;



<P>and the addition it was ever receiving in the consideration



<P>of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung,



<P>was beyond all her words to express.&nbsp; She regarded



<P>her cousin as an example of everything good and great,



<P>as possessing worth which no one but herself could



<P>ever appreciate, and as entitled to such gratitude



<P>from her as no feelings could be strong enough to pay.



<P>Her sentiments towards him were compounded of all that



<P>was respectful, grateful, confiding, and tender.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the horse continued in name, as well as fact,



<P>the property of Edmund, Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being



<P>for Fanny's use; and had Lady Bertram ever thought about



<P>her own objection again, he might have been excused in her



<P>eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas's return in September,



<P>for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad,



<P>and without any near prospect of finishing his business.



<P>Unfavourable circumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment



<P>when he was beginning to turn all his thoughts towards England;



<P>and the very great uncertainty in which everything was then



<P>involved determined him on sending home his son, and waiting



<P>the final arrangement by himself Tom arrived safely,



<P>bringing an excellent account of his father's health;



<P>but to very little purpose, as far as Mrs. Norris



<P>was concerned.&nbsp; Sir Thomas's sending away his son seemed



<P>to her so like a parent's care, under the influence of a



<P>foreboding of evil to himself, that she could not help



<P>feeling dreadful presentiments; and as the long evenings



<P>of autumn came on, was so terribly haunted by these ideas,



<P>in the sad solitariness of her cottage, as to be obliged



<P>to take daily refuge in the dining-room of the Park.



<P>The return of winter engagements, however, was not



<P>without its effect; and in the course of their progress,



<P>her mind became so pleasantly occupied in superintending



<P>the fortunes of her eldest niece, as tolerably to quiet



<P>her nerves.&nbsp; "If poor Sir Thomas were fated never to return,



<P>it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria



<P>well married," she very often thought; always when they



<P>were in the company of men of fortune, and particularly on



<P>the introduction of a young man who had recently succeeded



<P>to one of the largest estates and finest places in the country.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty



<P>of Miss Bertram, and, being inclined to marry, soon fancied



<P>himself in love.&nbsp; He was a heavy young man, with not more



<P>than common sense; but as there was nothing disagreeable



<P>in his figure or address, the young lady was well pleased



<P>with her conquest.&nbsp; Being now in her twenty-first year,



<P>Maria Bertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty;



<P>and as a marriage with Mr. Rushworth would give her the



<P>enjoyment of a larger income than her father's, as well as



<P>ensure her the house in town, which was now a prime object,



<P>it became, by the same rule of moral obligation,



<P>her evident duty to marry Mr. Rushworth if she could.



<P>Mrs. Norris was most zealous in promoting the match,



<P>by every suggestion and contrivance likely to enhance



<P>its desirableness to either party; and, among other means,



<P>by seeking an intimacy with the gentleman's mother,



<P>who at present lived with him, and to whom she even forced



<P>Lady Bertram to go through ten miles of indifferent road



<P>to pay a morning visit.&nbsp; It was not long before a good



<P>understanding took place between this lady and herself.



<P>Mrs. Rushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that



<P>her son should marry, and declared that of all the young



<P>ladies she had ever seen, Miss Bertram seemed, by her



<P>amiable qualities and accomplishments, the best adapted



<P>to make him happy.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris accepted the compliment,



<P>and admired the nice discernment of character which



<P>could so well distinguish merit.&nbsp; Maria was indeed



<P>the pride and delight of them all--perfectly faultless--



<P>an angel; and, of course, so surrounded by admirers, must be



<P>difficult in her choice:&nbsp; but yet, as far as Mrs. Norris



<P>could allow herself to decide on so short an acquaintance,



<P>Mr. Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve



<P>and attach her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls,



<P>the young people justified these opinions, and an engagement,



<P>with a due reference to the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into,



<P>much to the satisfaction of their respective families,



<P>and of the general lookers-on of the neighbourhood,



<P>who had, for many weeks past, felt the expediency



<P>of Mr. Rushworth's marrying Miss Bertram.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was some months before Sir Thomas's consent could



<P>be received; but, in the meanwhile, as no one felt



<P>a doubt of his most cordial pleasure in the connexion,



<P>the intercourse of the two families was carried on



<P>without restraint, and no other attempt made at secrecy



<P>than Mrs. Norris's talking of it everywhere as a matter



<P>not to be talked of at present.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault



<P>in the business; but no representation of his aunt's could



<P>induce him to find Mr. Rushworth a desirable companion.



<P>He could allow his sister to be the best judge of her



<P>own happiness, but he was not pleased that her happiness



<P>should centre in a large income; nor could he refrain



<P>from often saying to himself, in Mr. Rushworth's company--



<P>"If this man had not twelve thousand a year, he would be



<P>a very stupid fellow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas, however, was truly happy in the prospect of an



<P>alliance so unquestionably advantageous, and of which he



<P>heard nothing but the perfectly good and agreeable.



<P>It was a connexion exactly of the right sort--



<P>in the same county, and the same interest--and his most



<P>hearty concurrence was conveyed as soon as possible.



<P>He only conditioned that the marriage should not take



<P>place before his return, which he was again looking



<P>eagerly forward to.&nbsp; He wrote in April, and had strong



<P>hopes of settling everything to his entire satisfaction,



<P>and leaving Antigua before the end of the summer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such was the state of affairs in the month of July;



<P>and Fanny had just reached her eighteenth year, when the



<P>society of the village received an addition in the brother



<P>and sister of Mrs. Grant, a Mr. and Miss Crawford,



<P>the children of her mother by a second marriage.



<P>They were young people of fortune.&nbsp; The son had a good



<P>estate in Norfolk, the daughter twenty thousand pounds.



<P>As children, their sister had been always very fond



<P>of them; but, as her own marriage had been soon followed



<P>by the death of their common parent, which left them



<P>to the care of a brother of their father, of whom



<P>Mrs. Grant knew nothing, she had scarcely seen them since.



<P>In their uncle's house they had found a kind home.



<P>Admiral and Mrs. Crawford, though agreeing in nothing else,



<P>were united in affection for these children, or, at least,



<P>were no farther adverse in their feelings than that each



<P>had their favourite, to whom they showed the greatest



<P>fondness of the two.&nbsp; The Admiral delighted in the boy,



<P>Mrs. Crawford doted on the girl; and it was the lady's



<P>death which now obliged her _protegee_, after some months'



<P>further trial at her uncle's house, to find another home.



<P>Admiral Crawford was a man of vicious conduct, who chose,



<P>instead of retaining his niece, to bring his mistress



<P>under his own roof; and to this Mrs. Grant was indebted



<P>for her sister's proposal of coming to her, a measure quite



<P>as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on the other;



<P>for Mrs. Grant, having by this time run through the usual



<P>resources of ladies residing in the country without a



<P>family of children--having more than filled her favourite



<P>sitting-room with pretty furniture, and made a choice



<P>collection of plants and poultry--was very much in want



<P>of some variety at home.&nbsp; The arrival, therefore, of a sister



<P>whom she had always loved, and now hoped to retain with



<P>her as long as she remained single, was highly agreeable;



<P>and her chief anxiety was lest Mansfield should not satisfy



<P>the habits of a young woman who had been mostly used



<P>to London.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford was not entirely free from similar



<P>apprehensions, though they arose principally from doubts



<P>of her sister's style of living and tone of society;



<P>and it was not till after she had tried in vain to persuade



<P>her brother to settle with her at his own country house,



<P>that she could resolve to hazard herself among her



<P>other relations.&nbsp; To anything like a permanence of abode,



<P>or limitation of society, Henry Crawford had, unluckily,



<P>a great dislike:&nbsp; he could not accommodate his sister



<P>in an article of such importance; but he escorted her,



<P>with the utmost kindness, into Northamptonshire,



<P>and as readily engaged to fetch her away again, at half



<P>an hour's notice, whenever she were weary of the place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The meeting was very satisfactory on each side.



<P>Miss Crawford found a sister without preciseness



<P>or rusticity, a sister's husband who looked the gentleman,



<P>and a house commodious and well fitted up; and Mrs. Grant



<P>received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever



<P>a young man and woman of very prepossessing appearance.



<P>Mary Crawford was remarkably pretty; Henry, though not handsome,



<P>had air and countenance; the manners of both were lively



<P>and pleasant, and Mrs. Grant immediately gave them credit



<P>for everything else.&nbsp; She was delighted with each,



<P>but Mary was her dearest object; and having never been



<P>able to glory in beauty of her own, she thoroughly enjoyed



<P>the power of being proud of her sister's. She had not waited



<P>her arrival to look out for a suitable match for her:



<P>she had fixed on Tom Bertram; the eldest son of a baronet



<P>was not too good for a girl of twenty thousand pounds,



<P>with all the elegance and accomplishments which Mrs. Grant



<P>foresaw in her; and being a warm-hearted, unreserved woman,



<P>Mary had not been three hours in the house before she



<P>told her what she had planned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence



<P>so very near them, and not at all displeased either at



<P>her sister's early care, or the choice it had fallen on.



<P>Matrimony was her object, provided she could marry well:



<P>and having seen Mr. Bertram in town, she knew that



<P>objection could no more be made to his person than to



<P>his situation in life.&nbsp; While she treated it as a joke,



<P>therefore, she did not forget to think of it seriously.



<P>The scheme was soon repeated to Henry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And now," added Mrs. Grant, "I have thought of something



<P>to make it complete.&nbsp; I should dearly love to settle you



<P>both in this country; and therefore, Henry, you shall



<P>marry the youngest Miss Bertram, a nice, handsome,



<P>good-humoured, accomplished girl, who will make you very happy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Henry bowed and thanked her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear sister," said Mary, "if you can persuade him



<P>into anything of the sort, it will be a fresh matter of



<P>delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever,



<P>and I shall only regret that you have not half a dozen



<P>daughters to dispose of.&nbsp; If you can persuade Henry



<P>to marry, you must have the address of a Frenchwoman.



<P>All that English abilities can do has been tried already.



<P>I have three very particular friends who have been all



<P>dying for him in their turn; and the pains which they,



<P>their mothers (very clever women), as well as my dear



<P>aunt and myself, have taken to reason, coax, or trick



<P>him into marrying, is inconceivable!&nbsp; He is the most



<P>horrible flirt that can be imagined.&nbsp; If your Miss



<P>Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke, let them



<P>avoid Henry."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear brother, I will not believe this of you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I am sure you are too good.&nbsp; You will be kinder than Mary.



<P>You will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience.



<P>I am of a cautious temper, and unwilling to risk my



<P>happiness in a hurry.&nbsp; Nobody can think more highly of



<P>the matrimonial state than myself I consider the blessing



<P>of a wife as most justly described in those discreet



<P>lines of the poet--'Heaven's _last_ best gift.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There, Mrs. Grant, you see how he dwells on one word,



<P>and only look at his smile.&nbsp; I assure you he is very detestable;



<P>the Admiral's lessons have quite spoiled him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I pay very little regard," said Mrs. Grant, "to what



<P>any young person says on the subject of marriage.



<P>If they profess a disinclination for it, I only set it



<P>down that they have not yet seen the right person."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford



<P>on feeling no disinclination to the state herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh yes!&nbsp; I am not at all ashamed of it.&nbsp; I would



<P>have everybody marry if they can do it properly:



<P>I do not like to have people throw themselves away;



<P>but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it



<P>to advantage."

<B>CHAPTER X</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, passed away,



<P>and Fanny was still thinking of Edmund, Miss Crawford,



<P>and herself, without interruption from any one.&nbsp; She began



<P>to be surprised at being left so long, and to listen



<P>with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their



<P>voices again.&nbsp; She listened, and at length she heard;



<P>she heard voices and feet approaching; but she had just



<P>satisfied herself that it was not those she wanted,



<P>when Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth, and Mr. Crawford issued



<P>from the same path which she had trod herself, and were



<P>before her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Price all alone" and "My dear Fanny, how comes this?"



<P>were the first salutations.&nbsp; She told her story.



<P>"Poor dear Fanny," cried her cousin, "how ill you have been



<P>used by them!&nbsp; You had better have staid with us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then seating herself with a gentleman on each side,



<P>she resumed the conversation which had engaged them before,



<P>and discussed the possibility of improvements with



<P>much animation.&nbsp; Nothing was fixed on; but Henry Crawford



<P>was full of ideas and projects, and, generally speaking,



<P>whatever he proposed was immediately approved, first by her,



<P>and then by Mr. Rushworth, whose principal business



<P>seemed to be to hear the others, and who scarcely risked



<P>an original thought of his own beyond a wish that they



<P>had seen his friend Smith's place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After some minutes spent in this way, Miss Bertram,



<P>observing the iron gate, expressed a wish of passing



<P>through it into the park, that their views and their



<P>plans might be more comprehensive.&nbsp; It was the very thing



<P>of all others to be wished, it was the best, it was



<P>the only way of proceeding with any advantage, in Henry



<P>Crawford's opinion; and he directly saw a knoll not half



<P>a mile off, which would give them exactly the requisite



<P>command of the house.&nbsp; Go therefore they must to that knoll,



<P>and through that gate; but the gate was locked.



<P>Mr. Rushworth wished he had brought the key; he had been



<P>very near thinking whether he should not bring the key;



<P>he was determined he would never come without the key again;



<P>but still this did not remove the present evil.&nbsp; They could



<P>not get through; and as Miss Bertram's inclination for so



<P>doing did by no means lessen, it ended in Mr. Rushworth's



<P>declaring outright that he would go and fetch the key.



<P>He set off accordingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now, as we



<P>are so far from the house already," said Mr. Crawford,



<P>when he was gone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, there is nothing else to be done.&nbsp; But now, sincerely,



<P>do not you find the place altogether worse than you expected?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, indeed, far otherwise.&nbsp; I find it better, grander, more



<P>complete in its style, though that style may not be the best.



<P>And to tell you the truth," speaking rather lower, "I do not



<P>think that _I_ shall ever see Sotherton again with so much



<P>pleasure as I do now.&nbsp; Another summer will hardly improve it to



<P>me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a moment's embarrassment the lady replied, "You are



<P>too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes



<P>of the world.&nbsp; If other people think Sotherton improved,



<P>I have no doubt that you will."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world



<P>as might be good for me in some points.&nbsp; My feelings



<P>are not quite so evanescent, nor my memory of the past



<P>under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case



<P>with men of the world."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was followed by a short silence.&nbsp; Miss Bertram



<P>began again.&nbsp; "You seemed to enjoy your drive here very much



<P>this morning.&nbsp; I was glad to see you so well entertained.



<P>You and Julia were laughing the whole way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Were we?&nbsp; Yes, I believe we were; but I have not



<P>the least recollection at what.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I believe



<P>I was relating to her some ridiculous stories



<P>of an old Irish groom of my uncle's. Your sister loves to laugh."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You think her more light-hearted than I am?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"More easily amused," he replied; "consequently, you know,"



<P>smiling, "better company.&nbsp; I could not have hoped



<P>to entertain you with Irish anecdotes during a ten miles' drive."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Naturally, I believe, I am as lively as Julia, but I



<P>have more to think of now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have, undoubtedly; and there are situations in



<P>which very high spirits would denote insensibility.



<P>Your prospects, however, are too fair to justify want



<P>of spirits.&nbsp; You have a very smiling scene before you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you mean literally or figuratively?&nbsp; Literally,



<P>I conclude.&nbsp; Yes, certainly, the sun shines, and the park



<P>looks very cheerful.&nbsp; But unluckily that iron gate,



<P>that ha-ha, give me a feeling of restraint and hardship.



<P>"I cannot get out, as the starling said."&nbsp; As she spoke,



<P>and it was with expression, she walked to the gate:



<P>he followed her.&nbsp; "Mr. Rushworth is so long fetching



<P>this key!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And for the world you would not get out without the key



<P>and without Mr. Rushworth's authority and protection,



<P>or I think you might with little difficulty pass round



<P>the edge of the gate, here, with my assistance; I think it



<P>might be done, if you really wished to be more at large,



<P>and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Prohibited! nonsense!&nbsp; I certainly can get out that way,



<P>and I will.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment,



<P>you know; we shall not be out of sight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Or if we are, Miss Price will be so good as to tell him



<P>that he will find us near that knoll:&nbsp; the grove of oak



<P>on the knoll."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, feeling all this to be wrong, could not help



<P>making an effort to prevent it.&nbsp; "You will hurt yourself,



<P>Miss Bertram," she cried; "you will certainly hurt



<P>yourself against those spikes; you will tear your gown;



<P>you will be in danger of slipping into the ha-ha. You had



<P>better not go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her cousin was safe on the other side while these words



<P>were spoken, and, smiling with all the good-humour



<P>of success, she said, "Thank you, my dear Fanny,



<P>but I and my gown are alive and well, and so good-bye."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was again left to her solitude, and with no increase



<P>of pleasant feelings, for she was sorry for almost all



<P>that she had seen and heard, astonished at Miss Bertram,



<P>and angry with Mr. Crawford.&nbsp; By taking a circuitous



<P>route, and, as it appeared to her, very unreasonable



<P>direction to the knoll, they were soon beyond her eye;



<P>and for some minutes longer she remained without sight



<P>or sound of any companion.&nbsp; She seemed to have the little



<P>wood all to herself.&nbsp; She could almost have thought



<P>that Edmund and Miss Crawford had left it, but that



<P>it was impossible for Edmund to forget her so entirely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was again roused from disagreeable musings by sudden footsteps:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>somebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal walk.



<P>She expected Mr. Rushworth, but it was Julia, who,



<P>hot and out of breath, and with a look of disappointment,



<P>cried out on seeing her, "Heyday!&nbsp; Where are the others?



<P>I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny explained.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A pretty trick, upon my word!&nbsp; I cannot see them anywhere,"



<P>looking eagerly into the park.&nbsp; "But they cannot be very



<P>far off, and I think I am equal to as much as Maria,



<P>even without help."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, Julia, Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment



<P>with the key.&nbsp; Do wait for Mr. Rushworth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not I, indeed.&nbsp; I have had enough of the family for



<P>one morning.&nbsp; Why, child, I have but this moment escaped from



<P>his horrible mother.&nbsp; Such a penance as I have been enduring,



<P>while you were sitting here so composed and so happy!



<P>It might have been as well, perhaps, if you had been in



<P>my place, but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was a most unjust reflection, but Fanny could allow



<P>for it, and let it pass:&nbsp; Julia was vexed, and her



<P>temper was hasty; but she felt that it would not last,



<P>and therefore, taking no notice, only asked her if she



<P>had not seen Mr. Rushworth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, yes, we saw him.&nbsp; He was posting away as if upon



<P>life and death, and could but just spare time to tell us



<P>his errand, and where you all were."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_That_ is Miss Maria's concern.&nbsp; I am not obliged



<P>to punish myself for _her_ sins.&nbsp; The mother I could



<P>not avoid, as long as my tiresome aunt was dancing about



<P>with the housekeeper, but the son I _can_ get away from."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And she immediately scrambled across the fence,



<P>and walked away, not attending to Fanny's last question of



<P>whether she had seen anything of Miss Crawford and Edmund.



<P>The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat of seeing



<P>Mr. Rushworth prevented her thinking so much of their



<P>continued absence, however, as she might have done.



<P>She felt that he had been very ill-used, and was quite



<P>unhappy in having to communicate what had passed.



<P>He joined her within five minutes after Julia's exit;



<P>and though she made the best of the story, he was evidently



<P>mortified and displeased in no common degree.&nbsp; At first



<P>he scarcely said anything; his looks only expressed his



<P>extreme surprise and vexation, and he walked to the gate



<P>and stood there, without seeming to know what to do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They desired me to stay--my cousin Maria charged me to say



<P>that you would find them at that knoll, or thereabouts."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not believe I shall go any farther," said he sullenly;



<P>"I see nothing of them.&nbsp; By the time I get to the knoll they



<P>may be gone somewhere else.&nbsp; I have had walking enough."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am very sorry," said she; "it is very unlucky."&nbsp; And she



<P>longed to be able to say something more to the purpose.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After an interval of silence, "I think they might as well



<P>have staid for me," said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Bertram thought you would follow her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should not have had to follow her if she had staid."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This could not be denied, and Fanny was silenced.



<P>After another pause, he went on--"Pray, Miss Price,



<P>are you such a great admirer of this Mr. Crawford as some



<P>people are?&nbsp; For my part, I can see nothing in him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not think him at all handsome."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Handsome!&nbsp; Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome.



<P>He is not five foot nine.&nbsp; I should not wonder if he is not more



<P>than five foot eight.&nbsp; I think he is an ill-looking fellow.



<P>In my opinion, these Crawfords are no addition at all.



<P>We did very well without them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A small sigh escaped Fanny here, and she did not know



<P>how to contradict him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key,



<P>there might have been some excuse, but I went the very



<P>moment she said she wanted it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing could be more obliging than your manner, I am sure,



<P>and I dare say you walked as fast as you could; but still



<P>it is some distance, you know, from this spot to the house,



<P>quite into the house; and when people are waiting,



<P>they are bad judges of time, and every half minute seems



<P>like five."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He got up and walked to the gate again, and "wished he



<P>had had the key about him at the time."&nbsp; Fanny thought she



<P>discerned in his standing there an indication of relenting,



<P>which encouraged her to another attempt, and she said,



<P>therefore, "It is a pity you should not join them.



<P>They expected to have a better view of the house from



<P>that part of the park, and will be thinking how it



<P>may be improved; and nothing of that sort, you know,



<P>can be settled without you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She found herself more successful in sending away than



<P>in retaining a companion.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth was worked on.



<P>"Well," said he, "if you really think I had better go:



<P>it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing."



<P>And letting himself out, he walked off without farther



<P>ceremony.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who



<P>had left her so long ago, and getting quite impatient,



<P>she resolved to go in search of them.&nbsp; She followed



<P>their steps along the bottom walk, and had just turned



<P>up into another, when the voice and the laugh of Miss



<P>Crawford once more caught her ear; the sound approached,



<P>and a few more windings brought them before her.



<P>They were just returned into the wilderness from the park,



<P>to which a sidegate, not fastened, had tempted them very



<P>soon after their leaving her, and they had been across



<P>a portion of the park into the very avenue which Fanny



<P>had been hoping the whole morning to reach at last,



<P>and had been sitting down under one of the trees.



<P>This was their history.&nbsp; It was evident that they had been



<P>spending their time pleasantly, and were not aware of the



<P>length of their absence.&nbsp; Fanny's best consolation was



<P>in being assured that Edmund had wished for her very much,



<P>and that he should certainly have come back for her,



<P>had she not been tired already; but this was not quite



<P>sufficient to do away with the pain of having been left



<P>a whole hour, when he had talked of only a few minutes,



<P>nor to banish the sort of curiosity she felt to know



<P>what they had been conversing about all that time;



<P>and the result of the whole was to her disappointment



<P>and depression, as they prepared by general agreement to



<P>return to the house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace,



<P>Mrs. Rushworth and Mrs. Norris presented themselves



<P>at the top, just ready for the wilderness, at the end



<P>of an hour and a half from their leaving the house.



<P>Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster.



<P>Whatever cross-accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures



<P>of her nieces, she had found a morning of complete enjoyment;



<P>for the housekeeper, after a great many courtesies on



<P>the subject of pheasants, had taken her to the dairy,



<P>told her all about their cows, and given her the receipt



<P>for a famous cream cheese; and since Julia's leaving them



<P>they had been met by the gardener, with whom she had made



<P>a most satisfactory acquaintance, for she had set him



<P>right as to his grandson's illness, convinced him that it



<P>was an ague, and promised him a charm for it; and he,



<P>in return, had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants,



<P>and actually presented her with a very curious specimen



<P>of heath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On this _ rencontre_ they all returned to the house together,



<P>there to lounge away the time as they could with sofas,



<P>and chit-chat, and Quarterly Reviews, till the return



<P>of the others, and the arrival of dinner.&nbsp; It was late



<P>before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen came in,



<P>and their ramble did not appear to have been more than



<P>partially agreeable, or at all productive of anything



<P>useful with regard to the object of the day.&nbsp; By their



<P>own accounts they had been all walking after each other,



<P>and the junction which had taken place at last seemed,



<P>to Fanny's observation, to have been as much too late



<P>for re-establishing harmony, as it confessedly had



<P>been for determining on any alteration.&nbsp; She felt,



<P>as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth, that hers



<P>was not the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them:



<P>there was gloom on the face of each.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford



<P>and Miss Bertram were much more gay, and she thought



<P>that he was taking particular pains, during dinner,



<P>to do away any little resentment of the other two,



<P>and restore general good-humour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dinner was soon followed by tea and coffee, a ten miles'



<P>drive home allowed no waste of hours; and from the time



<P>of their sitting down to table, it was a quick succession



<P>of busy nothings till the carriage came to the door,



<P>and Mrs. Norris, having fidgeted about, and obtained a



<P>few pheasants' eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper,



<P>and made abundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth,



<P>was ready to lead the way.&nbsp; At the same moment Mr. Crawford,



<P>approaching Julia, said, "I hope I am not to lose



<P>my companion, unless she is afraid of the evening air



<P>in so exposed a seat."&nbsp; The request had not been foreseen,



<P>but was very graciously received, and Julia's day was



<P>likely to end almost as well as it began.&nbsp; Miss Bertram



<P>had made up her mind to something different, and was a



<P>little disappointed; but her conviction of being really



<P>the one preferred comforted her under it, and enabled her



<P>to receive Mr. Rushworth's parting attentions as she ought.



<P>He was certainly better pleased to hand her into



<P>the barouche than to assist her in ascending the box,



<P>and his complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word,"



<P>said Mrs. Norris, as they drove through the park.



<P>"Nothing but pleasure from beginning to end!&nbsp; I am sure



<P>you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram



<P>and me for contriving to let you go.&nbsp; A pretty good day's



<P>amusement you have had!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maria was just discontented enough to say directly, "I think



<P>_you_ have done pretty well yourself, ma'am. Your lap seems



<P>full of good things, and here is a basket of something



<P>between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear, it is only a beautiful little heath,



<P>which that nice old gardener would make me take; but if



<P>it is in your way, I will have it in my lap directly.



<P>There, Fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me;



<P>take great care of it:&nbsp; do not let it fall; it is a



<P>cream cheese, just like the excellent one we had at dinner.



<P>Nothing would satisfy that good old Mrs. Whitaker,



<P>but my taking one of the cheeses.&nbsp; I stood out as long



<P>as I could, till the tears almost came into her eyes,



<P>and I knew it was just the sort that my sister would



<P>be delighted with.&nbsp; That Mrs. Whitaker is a treasure!



<P>She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed



<P>at the second table, and she has turned away two housemaids



<P>for wearing white gowns.&nbsp; Take care of the cheese, Fanny.



<P>Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What else have you been spunging?" said Maria,



<P>half-pleased that Sotherton should be so complimented.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Spunging, my dear!&nbsp; It is nothing but four of those



<P>beautiful pheasants' eggs, which Mrs. Whitaker would



<P>quite force upon me:&nbsp; she would not take a denial.



<P>She said it must be such an amusement to me, as she



<P>understood I lived quite alone, to have a few living



<P>creatures of that sort; and so to be sure it will.



<P>I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first



<P>spare hen, and if they come to good I can have them moved



<P>to my own house and borrow a coop; and it will be a great



<P>delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them.



<P>And if I have good luck, your mother shall have some."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a beautiful evening, mild and still, and the



<P>drive was as pleasant as the serenity of Nature



<P>could make it; but when Mrs. Norris ceased speaking,



<P>it was altogether a silent drive to those within.



<P>Their spirits were in general exhausted; and to determine



<P>whether the day had afforded most pleasure or pain,



<P>might occupy the meditations of almost all.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The day at Sotherton, with all its imperfections,



<P>afforded the Miss Bertrams much more agreeable feelings



<P>than were derived from the letters from Antigua,



<P>which soon afterwards reached Mansfield.&nbsp; It was much



<P>pleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father;



<P>and to think of their father in England again within



<P>a certain period, which these letters obliged them to do,



<P>was a most unwelcome exercise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>November was the black month fixed for his return.



<P>Sir Thomas wrote of it with as much decision as experience



<P>and anxiety could authorise.&nbsp; His business was so nearly



<P>concluded as to justify him in proposing to take his



<P>passage in the September packet, and he consequently



<P>looked forward with the hope of being with his beloved



<P>family again early in November.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maria was more to be pitied than Julia; for to her the



<P>father brought a husband, and the return of the friend most



<P>solicitous for her happiness would unite her to the lover,



<P>on whom she had chosen that happiness should depend.



<P>It was a gloomy prospect, and all she could do was to



<P>throw a mist over it, and hope when the mist cleared



<P>away she should see something else.&nbsp; It would hardly



<P>be _early_ in November, there were generally delays,



<P>a bad passage or _something_; that favouring _something_



<P>which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look,



<P>or their understandings while they reason, feels the



<P>comfort of.&nbsp; It would probably be the middle of November



<P>at least; the middle of November was three months off.



<P>Three months comprised thirteen weeks.&nbsp; Much might happen



<P>in thirteen weeks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion



<P>of half that his daughters felt on the subject of his return,



<P>and would hardly have found consolation in a knowledge of the



<P>interest it excited in the breast of another young lady.



<P>Miss Crawford, on walking up with her brother to spend



<P>the evening at Mansfield Park, heard the good news;



<P>and though seeming to have no concern in the affair



<P>beyond politeness, and to have vented all her feelings



<P>in a quiet congratulation, heard it with an attention



<P>not so easily satisfied.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris gave the particulars



<P>of the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea,



<P>as Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with



<P>Edmund and Fanny looking out on a twilight scene,



<P>while the Miss Bertrams, Mr. Rushworth, and Henry Crawford



<P>were all busy with candles at the pianoforte, she suddenly



<P>revived it by turning round towards the group, and saying,



<P>"How happy Mr. Rushworth looks!&nbsp; He is thinking of November."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too, but had nothing



<P>to say.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your father's return will be a very interesting event."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence



<P>not only long, but including so many dangers."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events:



<P>your sister's marriage, and your taking orders."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't be affronted," said she, laughing, "but it does



<P>put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes, who,



<P>after performing great exploits in a foreign land,



<P>offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is no sacrifice in the case," replied Edmund,



<P>with a serious smile, and glancing at the pianoforte again;



<P>"it is entirely her own doing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh yes I know it is.&nbsp; I was merely joking.&nbsp; She has



<P>done no more than what every young woman would do;



<P>and I have no doubt of her being extremely happy.



<P>My other sacrifice, of course, you do not understand."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary



<P>as Maria's marrying."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is fortunate that your inclination and your father's



<P>convenience should accord so well.&nbsp; There is a very good



<P>living kept for you, I understand, hereabouts."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Which you suppose has biassed me?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But _that_ I am sure it has not," cried Fanny.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than



<P>I would affirm myself.&nbsp; On the contrary, the knowing



<P>that there was such a provision for me probably did



<P>bias me.&nbsp; Nor can I think it wrong that it should.



<P>There was no natural disinclination to be overcome,



<P>and I see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman



<P>for knowing that he will have a competence early in life.



<P>I was in safe hands.&nbsp; I hope I should not have been



<P>influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure my father



<P>was too conscientious to have allowed it.&nbsp; I have no doubt



<P>that I was biased, but I think it was blamelessly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is the same sort of thing," said Fanny, after a



<P>short pause, "as for the son of an admiral to go into



<P>the navy, or the son of a general to be in the army,



<P>and nobody sees anything wrong in that.&nbsp; Nobody wonders



<P>that they should prefer the line where their friends can



<P>serve them best, or suspects them to be less in earnest



<P>in it than they appear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good.&nbsp; The profession,



<P>either navy or army, is its own justification.&nbsp; It has



<P>everything in its favour:&nbsp; heroism, danger, bustle, fashion.



<P>Soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society.



<P>Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty



<P>of preferment may be fairly suspected, you think?"



<P>said Edmund.&nbsp; "To be justified in your eyes, he must



<P>do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What! take orders without a living!&nbsp; No; that is



<P>madness indeed; absolute madness."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man



<P>is neither to take orders with a living nor without?



<P>No; for you certainly would not know what to say.



<P>But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from



<P>your own argument.&nbsp; As he cannot be influenced by those



<P>feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward



<P>to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession,



<P>as heroism, and noise, and fashion, are all against him,



<P>he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting



<P>sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income



<P>ready made, to the trouble of working for one; and has



<P>the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his



<P>days but eat, drink, and grow fat.&nbsp; It is indolence,



<P>Mr. Bertram, indeed.&nbsp; Indolence and love of ease; a want



<P>of all laudable ambition, of taste for good company,



<P>or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable,



<P>which make men clergymen.&nbsp; A clergyman has nothing



<P>to do but be slovenly and selfish--read the newspaper,



<P>watch the weather, and quarrel with his wife.&nbsp; His curate



<P>does all the work, and the business of his own life is



<P>to dine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they



<P>are not so common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming



<P>it their general character.&nbsp; I suspect that in this



<P>comprehensive and (may I say) commonplace censure, you are



<P>not judging from yourself, but from prejudiced persons,



<P>whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing.



<P>It is impossible that your own observation can have given



<P>you much knowledge of the clergy.&nbsp; You can have been



<P>personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you



<P>condemn so conclusively.&nbsp; You are speaking what you have



<P>been told at your uncle's table."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I speak what appears to me the general opinion;



<P>and where an opinion is general, it is usually correct.



<P>Though _I_ have not seen much of the domestic lives



<P>of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency



<P>of information."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination,



<P>are condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency



<P>of information, or (smiling) of something else.



<P>Your uncle, and his brother admirals, perhaps knew little



<P>of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or bad,



<P>they were always wishing away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor William!&nbsp; He has met with great kindness from



<P>the chaplain of the Antwerp," was a tender apostrophe



<P>of Fanny's, very much to the purpose of her own feelings



<P>if not of the conversation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from



<P>my uncle," said Miss Crawford, "that I can hardly suppose--



<P>and since you push me so hard, I must observe, that I am



<P>not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are,



<P>being at this present time the guest of my own brother,



<P>Dr. Grant.&nbsp; And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging



<P>to me, and though he is really a gentleman, and, I dare say,



<P>a good scholar and clever, and often preaches good sermons,



<P>and is very respectable, _I_ see him to be an indolent,



<P>selfish _bon_ _vivant_, who must have his palate consulted



<P>in everything; who will not stir a finger for the convenience



<P>of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook makes a blunder,



<P>is out of humour with his excellent wife.&nbsp; To own the truth,



<P>Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening



<P>by a disappointment about a green goose, which he could



<P>not get the better of.&nbsp; My poor sister was forced to stay



<P>and bear it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word.



<P>It is a great defect of temper, made worse by a very faulty



<P>habit of self-indulgence; and to see your sister suffering



<P>from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings



<P>as yours.&nbsp; Fanny, it goes against us.&nbsp; We cannot attempt



<P>to defend Dr. Grant."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," replied Fanny, "but we need not give up his profession



<P>for all that; because, whatever profession Dr. Grant



<P>had chosen, he would have taken a--not a good temper into it;



<P>and as he must, either in the navy or army, have had a



<P>great many more people under his command than he has now,



<P>I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a



<P>sailor or soldier than as a clergyman.&nbsp; Besides, I cannot



<P>but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise



<P>in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of



<P>becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession,



<P>where he would have had less time and obligation--



<P>where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself,



<P>the _frequency_, at least, of that knowledge which it



<P>is impossible he should escape as he is now.&nbsp; A man--



<P>a sensible man like Dr. Grant, cannot be in the habit



<P>of teaching others their duty every week, cannot go



<P>to church twice every Sunday, and preach such very good



<P>sermons in so good a manner as he does, without being



<P>the better for it himself.&nbsp; It must make him think;



<P>and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain



<P>himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish



<P>you a better fate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man



<P>whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons; for though



<P>he may preach himself into a good-humour every Sunday,



<P>it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green



<P>geese from Monday morning till Saturday night."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,"



<P>said Edmund affectionately, "must be beyond the reach



<P>of any sermons."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny turned farther into the window; and Miss



<P>Crawford had only time to say, in a pleasant manner,



<P>"I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve



<P>praise than to hear it"; when, being earnestly invited



<P>by the Miss Bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off



<P>to the instrument, leaving Edmund looking after her



<P>in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many virtues,



<P>from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There goes good-humour, I am sure," said he presently.



<P>"There goes a temper which would never give pain!



<P>How well she walks! and how readily she falls in with the



<P>inclination of others! joining them the moment she is asked.



<P>What a pity," he added, after an instant's reflection,



<P>"that she should have been in such hands!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny agreed to it, and had the pleasure of seeing him continue



<P>at the window with her, in spite of the expected glee;



<P>and of having his eyes soon turned, like hers, towards the



<P>scene without, where all that was solemn, and soothing,



<P>and lovely, appeared in the brilliancy of an unclouded night,



<P>and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods.&nbsp; Fanny spoke



<P>her feelings.&nbsp; "Here's harmony!" said she; "here's repose!



<P>Here's what may leave all painting and all music behind,



<P>and what poetry only can attempt to describe!&nbsp; Here's what



<P>may tranquillise every care, and lift the heart to rapture!



<P>When I look out on such a night as this, I feel as if there



<P>could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world;



<P>and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity



<P>of Nature were more attended to, and people were carried



<P>more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny.&nbsp; It is a lovely night,



<P>and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught



<P>to feel, in some degree, as you do; who have not,



<P>at least, been given a taste for Nature in early life.



<P>They lose a great deal."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_You_ taught me to think and feel on the subject, cousin."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had a very apt scholar.&nbsp; There's Arcturus looking



<P>very bright."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, and the Bear.&nbsp; I wish I could see Cassiopeia."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We must go out on the lawn for that.&nbsp; Should you be afraid?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not in the least.&nbsp; It is a great while since we have



<P>had any star-gazing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; I do not know how it has happened."&nbsp; The glee began.



<P>"We will stay till this is finished, Fanny," said he,



<P>turning his back on the window; and as it advanced,



<P>she had the mortification of seeing him advance too,



<P>moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument,



<P>and when it ceased, he was close by the singers, among the most



<P>urgent in requesting to hear the glee again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away



<P>by Mrs. Norris's threats of catching cold.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The young people were pleased with each other from



<P>the first.&nbsp; On each side there was much to attract,



<P>and their acquaintance soon promised as early an intimacy



<P>as good manners would warrant.&nbsp; Miss Crawford's



<P>beauty did her no disservice with the Miss Bertrams.



<P>They were too handsome themselves to dislike any woman



<P>for being so too, and were almost as much charmed as their



<P>brothers with her lively dark eye, clear brown complexion,



<P>and general prettiness.&nbsp; Had she been tall, full formed,



<P>and fair, it might have been more of a trial:&nbsp; but as it was,



<P>there could be no comparison; and she was most allowably



<P>a sweet, pretty girl, while they were the finest young



<P>women in the country.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her brother was not handsome:&nbsp; no, when they first saw him



<P>he was absolutely plain, black and plain; but still he



<P>was the gentleman, with a pleasing address.&nbsp; The second



<P>meeting proved him not so very plain:&nbsp; he was plain,



<P>to be sure, but then he had so much countenance, and his



<P>teeth were so good, and he was so well made, that one



<P>soon forgot he was plain; and after a third interview,



<P>after dining in company with him at the Parsonage,



<P>he was no longer allowed to be called so by anybody.



<P>He was, in fact, the most agreeable young man the sisters



<P>had ever known, and they were equally delighted with him.



<P>Miss Bertram's engagement made him in equity the property



<P>of Julia, of which Julia was fully aware; and before he had



<P>been at Mansfield a week, she was quite ready to be fallen



<P>in love with.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maria's notions on the subject were more confused



<P>and indistinct.&nbsp; She did not want to see or understand.



<P>"There could be no harm in her liking an agreeable man--



<P>everybody knew her situation--Mr. Crawford must take care



<P>of himself."&nbsp; Mr. Crawford did not mean to be in any danger!



<P>the Miss Bertrams were worth pleasing, and were ready



<P>to be pleased; and he began with no object but of making



<P>them like him.&nbsp; He did not want them to die of love;



<P>but with sense and temper which ought to have made him



<P>judge and feel better, he allowed himself great latitude



<P>on such points.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly, sister," said he,



<P>as he returned from attending them to their carriage



<P>after the said dinner visit; "they are very elegant,



<P>agreeable girls."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So they are indeed, and I am delighted to hear you say it.



<P>But you like Julia best."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh yes!&nbsp; I like Julia best."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But do you really? for Miss Bertram is in general thought



<P>the handsomest."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So I should suppose.&nbsp; She has the advantage in every feature,



<P>and I prefer her countenance; but I like Julia best;



<P>Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest, and I have found



<P>her the most agreeable, but I shall always like Julia best,



<P>because you order me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall not talk to you, Henry, but I know you _will_



<P>like her best at last."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do not I tell you that I like her best _at_ _first_?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And besides, Miss Bertram is engaged.&nbsp; Remember that,



<P>my dear brother.&nbsp; Her choice is made."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, and I like her the better for it.&nbsp; An engaged



<P>woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged.



<P>She is satisfied with herself.&nbsp; Her cares are over,



<P>and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing



<P>without suspicion.&nbsp; All is safe with a lady engaged:



<P>no harm can be done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, as to that, Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort



<P>of young man, and it is a great match for her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him;



<P>_that_ is your opinion of your intimate friend.&nbsp; _I_ do



<P>not subscribe to it.&nbsp; I am sure Miss Bertram is very much



<P>attached to Mr. Rushworth.&nbsp; I could see it in her eyes,



<P>when he was mentioned.&nbsp; I think too well of Miss Bertram



<P>to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mary, how shall we manage him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We must leave him to himself, I believe.&nbsp; Talking does



<P>no good.&nbsp; He will be taken in at last."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But I would not have him _taken_ _in_; I would not have



<P>him duped; I would have it all fair and honourable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh dear! let him stand his chance and be taken in.



<P>It will do just as well.&nbsp; Everybody is taken in at some



<P>period or other."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not always in marriage, dear Mary."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"In marriage especially.&nbsp; With all due respect to such



<P>of the present company as chance to be married, my dear



<P>Mrs. Grant, there is not one in a hundred of either sex



<P>who is not taken in when they marry.&nbsp; Look where I will,



<P>I see that it _is_ so; and I feel that it _must_ be so,



<P>when I consider that it is, of all transactions, the one



<P>in which people expect most from others, and are least



<P>honest themselves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!&nbsp; You have been in a bad school for matrimony,



<P>in Hill Street."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love



<P>the state; but, however, speaking from my own observation,



<P>it is a manoeuvring business.&nbsp; I know so many who



<P>have married in the full expectation and confidence



<P>of some one particular advantage in the connexion,



<P>or accomplishment, or good quality in the person, who have



<P>found themselves entirely deceived, and been obliged



<P>to put up with exactly the reverse.&nbsp; What is this but a take in?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear child, there must be a little imagination here.



<P>I beg your pardon, but I cannot quite believe you.



<P>Depend upon it, you see but half.&nbsp; You see the evil,



<P>but you do not see the consolation.&nbsp; There will be



<P>little rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we



<P>are all apt to expect too much; but then, if one scheme



<P>of happiness fails, human nature turns to another;



<P>if the first calculation is wrong, we make a second better:



<P>we find comfort somewhere--and those evil-minded observers,



<P>dearest Mary, who make much of a little, are more taken



<P>in and deceived than the parties themselves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well done, sister!&nbsp; I honour your _esprit_ _du_ _corps_.



<P>When I am a wife, I mean to be just as staunch myself;



<P>and I wish my friends in general would be so too.&nbsp; It would



<P>save me many a heartache."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are as bad as your brother, Mary; but we will cure



<P>you both.&nbsp; Mansfield shall cure you both, and without



<P>any taking in.&nbsp; Stay with us, and we will cure you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Crawfords, without wanting to be cured, were very



<P>willing to stay.&nbsp; Mary was satisfied with the Parsonage



<P>as a present home, and Henry equally ready to lengthen



<P>his visit.&nbsp; He had come, intending to spend only a few



<P>days with them; but Mansfield promised well, and there



<P>was nothing to call him elsewhere.&nbsp; It delighted Mrs. Grant



<P>to keep them both with her, and Dr. Grant was exceedingly



<P>well contented to have it so:&nbsp; a talking pretty young



<P>woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society



<P>to an indolent, stay-at-home man; and Mr. Crawford's



<P>being his guest was an excuse for drinking claret every day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Miss Bertrams' admiration of Mr. Crawford was more



<P>rapturous than anything which Miss Crawford's habits made



<P>her likely to feel.&nbsp; She acknowledged, however, that the



<P>Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men, that two such



<P>young men were not often seen together even in London,



<P>and that their manners, particularly those of the eldest,



<P>were very good.&nbsp; _He_ had been much in London,



<P>and had more liveliness and gallantry than Edmund,



<P>and must, therefore, be preferred; and, indeed, his being



<P>the eldest was another strong claim.&nbsp; She had felt an early



<P>presentiment that she _should_ like the eldest best.



<P>She knew it was her way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Tom Bertram must have been thought pleasant, indeed, at any rate;



<P>he was the sort of young man to be generally liked,



<P>his agreeableness was of the kind to be oftener found



<P>agreeable than some endowments of a higher stamp, for he



<P>had easy manners, excellent spirits, a large acquaintance,



<P>and a great deal to say; and the reversion of Mansfield Park,



<P>and a baronetcy, did no harm to all this.&nbsp; Miss Crawford



<P>soon felt that he and his situation might do.&nbsp; She looked



<P>about her with due consideration, and found almost everything



<P>in his favour:&nbsp; a park, a real park, five miles round,



<P>a spacious modern-built house, so well placed and well



<P>screened as to deserve to be in any collection of engravings



<P>of gentlemen's seats in the kingdom, and wanting only to be



<P>completely new furnished--pleasant sisters, a quiet mother,



<P>and an agreeable man himself--with the advantage of



<P>being tied up from much gaming at present by a promise



<P>to his father, and of being Sir Thomas hereafter.



<P>It might do very well; she believed she should accept him;



<P>and she began accordingly to interest herself a little



<P>about the horse which he had to run at the B------- races.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These races were to call him away not long after their



<P>acquaintance began; and as it appeared that the family



<P>did not, from his usual goings on, expect him back



<P>again for many weeks, it would bring his passion to an



<P>early proof.&nbsp; Much was said on his side to induce her



<P>to attend the races, and schemes were made for a large



<P>party to them, with all the eagerness of inclination,



<P>but it would only do to be talked of.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And Fanny, what was _she_ doing and thinking all this



<P>while? and what was _her_ opinion of the newcomers?



<P>Few young ladies of eighteen could be less called on



<P>to speak their opinion than Fanny.&nbsp; In a quiet way,



<P>very little attended to, she paid her tribute of admiration



<P>to Miss Crawford's beauty; but as she still continued



<P>to think Mr. Crawford very plain, in spite of her two



<P>cousins having repeatedly proved the contrary, she never



<P>mentioned _him_.&nbsp; The notice, which she excited herself,



<P>was to this effect.&nbsp; "I begin now to understand you all,



<P>except Miss Price," said Miss Crawford, as she was



<P>walking with the Mr. Bertrams.&nbsp; "Pray, is she out,



<P>or is she not?&nbsp; I am puzzled.&nbsp; She dined at the Parsonage,



<P>with the rest of you, which seemed like being _out_;



<P>and yet she says so little, that I can hardly suppose



<P>she _is_."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund, to whom this was chiefly addressed, replied, "I believe



<P>I know what you mean, but I will not undertake to answer



<P>the question.&nbsp; My cousin is grown up.&nbsp; She has the age



<P>and sense of a woman, but the outs and not outs are beyond me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And yet, in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained.



<P>The distinction is so broad.&nbsp; Manners as well as



<P>appearance are, generally speaking, so totally different.



<P>Till now, I could not have supposed it possible to be



<P>mistaken as to a girl's being out or not.&nbsp; A girl not



<P>out has always the same sort of dress:&nbsp; a close bonnet,



<P>for instance; looks very demure, and never says a word.



<P>You may smile, but it is so, I assure you; and except



<P>that it is sometimes carried a little too far, it is



<P>all very proper.&nbsp; Girls should be quiet and modest.



<P>The most objectionable part is, that the alteration



<P>of manners on being introduced into company is frequently



<P>too sudden.&nbsp; They sometimes pass in such very little



<P>time from reserve to quite the opposite--to confidence!



<P>_That_ is the faulty part of the present system.



<P>One does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen



<P>so immediately up to every thing--and perhaps when one



<P>has seen her hardly able to speak the year before.



<P>Mr. Bertram, I dare say _you_ have sometimes met with



<P>such changes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I believe I have, but this is hardly fair; I see what you



<P>are at.&nbsp; You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, indeed.&nbsp; Miss Anderson!&nbsp; I do not know who or what



<P>you mean.&nbsp; I am quite in the dark.&nbsp; But I _will_ quiz you



<P>with a great deal of pleasure, if you will tell me what about."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! you carry it off very well, but I cannot be quite



<P>so far imposed on.&nbsp; You must have had Miss Anderson



<P>in your eye, in describing an altered young lady.



<P>You paint too accurately for mistake.&nbsp; It was exactly so.



<P>The Andersons of Baker Street.&nbsp; We were speaking of them



<P>the other day, you know.&nbsp; Edmund, you have heard me mention



<P>Charles Anderson.&nbsp; The circumstance was precisely as this



<P>lady has represented it.&nbsp; When Anderson first introduced



<P>me to his family, about two years ago, his sister was



<P>not _out_, and I could not get her to speak to me.



<P>I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson,



<P>with only her and a little girl or two in the room,



<P>the governess being sick or run away, and the mother



<P>in and out every moment with letters of business, and I



<P>could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady--



<P>nothing like a civil answer--she screwed up her mouth,



<P>and turned from me with such an air!&nbsp; I did not see



<P>her again for a twelvemonth.&nbsp; She was then _out_.



<P>I met her at Mrs. Holford's, and did not recollect her.



<P>She came up to me, claimed me as an acquaintance, stared me



<P>out of countenance; and talked and laughed till I did not



<P>know which way to look.&nbsp; I felt that I must be the jest



<P>of the room at the time, and Miss Crawford, it is plain,



<P>has heard the story."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And a very pretty story it is, and with more truth



<P>in it, I dare say, than does credit to Miss Anderson.



<P>It is too common a fault.&nbsp; Mothers certainly have not yet



<P>got quite the right way of managing their daughters.



<P>I do not know where the error lies.&nbsp; I do not pretend to set



<P>people right, but I do see that they are often wrong."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Those who are showing the world what female manners



<P>_should_ be," said Mr. Bertram gallantly, "are doing



<P>a great deal to set them right."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The error is plain enough," said the less courteous Edmund;



<P>"such girls are ill brought up.&nbsp; They are given wrong notions



<P>from the beginning.&nbsp; They are always acting upon motives



<P>of vanity, and there is no more real modesty in their



<P>behaviour _before_ they appear in public than afterwards."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know," replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly.



<P>"Yes, I cannot agree with you there.&nbsp; It is certainly



<P>the modestest part of the business.&nbsp; It is much worse to



<P>have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take



<P>the same liberties as if they were, which I have seen done.



<P>That is worse than anything--quite disgusting!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, _that_ is very inconvenient indeed," said Mr. Bertram.



<P>"It leads one astray; one does not know what to do.



<P>The close bonnet and demure air you describe so well (and



<P>nothing was ever juster), tell one what is expected;



<P>but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want



<P>of them.&nbsp; I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend



<P>last September, just after my return from the West Indies.



<P>My friend Sneyd--you have heard me speak of Sneyd, Edmund--



<P>his father, and mother, and sisters, were there, all new



<P>to me.&nbsp; When we reached Albion Place they were out;



<P>we went after them, and found them on the pier:&nbsp; Mrs. and



<P>the two Miss Sneyds, with others of their acquaintance.



<P>I made my bow in form; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded



<P>by men, attached myself to one of her daughters,



<P>walked by her side all the way home, and made myself



<P>as agreeable as I could; the young lady perfectly easy



<P>in her manners, and as ready to talk as to listen.



<P>I had not a suspicion that I could be doing anything wrong.



<P>They looked just the same:&nbsp; both well-dressed, with veils



<P>and parasols like other girls; but I afterwards found



<P>that I had been giving all my attention to the youngest,



<P>who was not _out_, and had most excessively offended



<P>the eldest.&nbsp; Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed



<P>for the next six months; and Miss Sneyd, I believe, has never



<P>forgiven me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That was bad indeed.&nbsp; Poor Miss Sneyd.&nbsp; "Though I have no



<P>younger sister, I feel for her.&nbsp; To be neglected before



<P>one's time must be very vexatious; but it was entirely



<P>the mother's fault.&nbsp; Miss Augusta should have been with



<P>her governess.&nbsp; Such half-and-half doings never prosper.



<P>But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price.



<P>Does she go to balls?&nbsp; Does she dine out every where,



<P>as well as at my sister's?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," replied Edmund; "I do not think she has ever been



<P>to a ball.&nbsp; My mother seldom goes into company herself,



<P>and dines nowhere but with Mrs. Grant, and Fanny stays at



<P>home with _her_."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! then the point is clear.&nbsp; Miss Price is not out."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Could Sir Thomas have seen all his niece's feelings,



<P>when she wrote her first letter to her aunt, he would



<P>not have despaired; for though a good night's rest,



<P>a pleasant morning, the hope of soon seeing William again,



<P>and the comparatively quiet state of the house, from Tom



<P>and Charles being gone to school, Sam on some project of



<P>his own, and her father on his usual lounges, enabled her



<P>to express herself cheerfully on the subject of home,



<P>there were still, to her own perfect consciousness,



<P>many drawbacks suppressed.&nbsp; Could he have seen only half



<P>that she felt before the end of a week, he would have



<P>thought Mr. Crawford sure of her, and been delighted with



<P>his own sagacity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before the week ended, it was all disappointment.



<P>In the first place, William was gone.&nbsp; The Thrush



<P>had had her orders, the wind had changed, and he was



<P>sailed within four days from their reaching Portsmouth;



<P>and during those days she had seen him only twice,



<P>in a short and hurried way, when he had come ashore



<P>on duty.&nbsp; There had been no free conversation, no walk



<P>on the ramparts, no visit to the dockyard, no acquaintance



<P>with the Thrush, nothing of all that they had planned



<P>and depended on.&nbsp; Everything in that quarter failed her,



<P>except William's affection.&nbsp; His last thought on leaving



<P>home was for her.&nbsp; He stepped back again to the door



<P>to say, "Take care of Fanny, mother.&nbsp; She is tender,



<P>and not used to rough it like the rest of us.&nbsp; I charge you,



<P>take care of Fanny."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>William was gone:&nbsp; and the home he had left her in was,



<P>Fanny could not conceal it from herself, in almost every



<P>respect the very reverse of what she could have wished.



<P>It was the abode of noise, disorder, and impropriety.



<P>Nobody was in their right place, nothing was done as it ought



<P>to be.&nbsp; She could not respect her parents as she had hoped.



<P>On her father, her confidence had not been sanguine, but he



<P>was more negligent of his family, his habits were worse,



<P>and his manners coarser, than she had been prepared for.



<P>He did not want abilities but he had no curiosity,



<P>and no information beyond his profession; he read only



<P>the newspaper and the navy-list; he talked only of



<P>the dockyard, the harbour, Spithead, and the Motherbank;



<P>he swore and he drank, he was dirty and gross.



<P>She had never been able to recall anything approaching



<P>to tenderness in his former treatment of herself.



<P>There had remained only a general impression of roughness



<P>and loudness; and now he scarcely ever noticed her,



<P>but to make her the object of a coarse joke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her disappointment in her mother was greater:



<P>_there_ she had hoped much, and found almost nothing.



<P>Every flattering scheme of being of consequence to her



<P>soon fell to the ground.&nbsp; Mrs. Price was not unkind;



<P>but, instead of gaining on her affection and confidence,



<P>and becoming more and more dear, her daughter never met



<P>with greater kindness from her than on the first day of



<P>her arrival.&nbsp; The instinct of nature was soon satisfied,



<P>and Mrs. Price's attachment had no other source.



<P>Her heart and her time were already quite full;



<P>she had neither leisure nor affection to bestow on Fanny.



<P>Her daughters never had been much to her.&nbsp; She was fond



<P>of her sons, especially of William, but Betsey was the first



<P>of her girls whom she had ever much regarded.&nbsp; To her she



<P>was most injudiciously indulgent.&nbsp; William was her pride;



<P>Betsey her darling; and John, Richard, Sam, Tom, and Charles



<P>occupied all the rest of her maternal solicitude, alternately



<P>her worries and her comforts.&nbsp; These shared her heart:



<P>her time was given chiefly to her house and her servants.



<P>Her days were spent in a kind of slow bustle; all was busy



<P>without getting on, always behindhand and lamenting it,



<P>without altering her ways; wishing to be an economist,



<P>without contrivance or regularity; dissatisfied with



<P>her servants, without skill to make them better,



<P>and whether helping, or reprimanding, or indulging them,



<P>without any power of engaging their respect.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of her two sisters, Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady



<P>Bertram than Mrs. Norris.&nbsp; She was a manager by necessity,



<P>without any of Mrs. Norris's inclination for it, or any



<P>of her activity.&nbsp; Her disposition was naturally easy



<P>and indolent, like Lady Bertram's; and a situation of similar



<P>affluence and do-nothingness would have been much more



<P>suited to her capacity than the exertions and self-denials



<P>of the one which her imprudent marriage had placed her in.



<P>She might have made just as good a woman of consequence



<P>as Lady Bertram, but Mrs. Norris would have been a more



<P>respectable mother of nine children on a small income.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Much of all this Fanny could not but be sensible of.



<P>She might scruple to make use of the words, but she



<P>must and did feel that her mother was a partial,



<P>ill-judging parent, a dawdle, a slattern, who neither taught



<P>nor restrained her children, whose house was the scene



<P>of mismanagement and discomfort from beginning to end,



<P>and who had no talent, no conversation, no affection



<P>towards herself; no curiosity to know her better,



<P>no desire of her friendship, and no inclination for her



<P>company that could lessen her sense of such feelings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was very anxious to be useful, and not to appear above



<P>her home, or in any way disqualified or disinclined, by her



<P>foreign education, from contributing her help to its comforts,



<P>and therefore set about working for Sam immediately;



<P>and by working early and late, with perseverance and



<P>great despatch, did so much that the boy was shipped



<P>off at last, with more than half his linen ready.



<P>She had great pleasure in feeling her usefulness, but could



<P>not conceive how they would have managed without her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sam, loud and overbearing as he was, she rather regretted



<P>when he went, for he was clever and intelligent, and glad



<P>to be employed in any errand in the town; and though



<P>spurning the remonstrances of Susan, given as they were,



<P>though very reasonable in themselves, with ill-timed



<P>and powerless warmth, was beginning to be influenced



<P>by Fanny's services and gentle persuasions; and she found



<P>that the best of the three younger ones was gone in him:



<P>Tom and Charles being at least as many years as they were



<P>his juniors distant from that age of feeling and reason,



<P>which might suggest the expediency of making friends,



<P>and of endeavouring to be less disagreeable.&nbsp; Their sister



<P>soon despaired of making the smallest impression on _them_;



<P>they were quite untameable by any means of address which she



<P>had spirits or time to attempt.&nbsp; Every afternoon brought



<P>a return of their riotous games all over the house; and she



<P>very early learned to sigh at the approach of Saturday's



<P>constant half-holiday.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Betsey, too, a spoiled child, trained up to think the



<P>alphabet her greatest enemy, left to be with the servants



<P>at her pleasure, and then encouraged to report any evil



<P>of them, she was almost as ready to despair of being



<P>able to love or assist; and of Susan's temper she had



<P>many doubts.&nbsp; Her continual disagreements with her mother,



<P>her rash squabbles with Tom and Charles, and petulance



<P>with Betsey, were at least so distressing to Fanny that,



<P>though admitting they were by no means without provocation,



<P>she feared the disposition that could push them to such



<P>length must be far from amiable, and from affording



<P>any repose to herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such was the home which was to put Mansfield out of



<P>her head, and teach her to think of her cousin Edmund with



<P>moderated feelings.&nbsp; On the contrary, she could think of



<P>nothing but Mansfield, its beloved inmates, its happy ways.



<P>Everything where she now was in full contrast to it.



<P>The elegance, propriety, regularity, harmony, and perhaps,



<P>above all, the peace and tranquillity of Mansfield,



<P>were brought to her remembrance every hour of the day,



<P>by the prevalence of everything opposite to them _here_.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The living in incessant noise was, to a frame and temper



<P>delicate and nervous like Fanny's, an evil which no



<P>superadded elegance or harmony could have entirely



<P>atoned for.&nbsp; It was the greatest misery of all.



<P>At Mansfield, no sounds of contention, no raised voice,



<P>no abrupt bursts, no tread of violence, was ever heard;



<P>all proceeded in a regular course of cheerful orderliness;



<P>everybody had their due importance; everybody's feelings



<P>were consulted.&nbsp; If tenderness could be ever supposed wanting,



<P>good sense and good breeding supplied its place; and as to



<P>the little irritations sometimes introduced by aunt Norris,



<P>they were short, they were trifling, they were as a drop



<P>of water to the ocean, compared with the ceaseless



<P>tumult of her present abode.&nbsp; Here everybody was noisy,



<P>every voice was loud (excepting, perhaps, her mother's,



<P>which resembled the soft monotony of Lady Bertram's,



<P>only worn into fretfulness). Whatever was wanted was



<P>hallooed for, and the servants hallooed out their excuses



<P>from the kitchen.&nbsp; The doors were in constant banging,



<P>the stairs were never at rest, nothing was done without



<P>a clatter, nobody sat still, and nobody could command



<P>attention when they spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a review of the two houses, as they appeared to her



<P>before the end of a week, Fanny was tempted to apply



<P>to them Dr. Johnson's celebrated judgment as to matrimony



<P>and celibacy, and say, that though Mansfield Park might



<P>have some pains, Portsmouth could have no pleasures.

<B>CHAPTER XIII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The Honourable John Yates, this new friend, had not much



<P>to recommend him beyond habits of fashion and expense,



<P>and being the younger son of a lord with a tolerable



<P>independence; and Sir Thomas would probably have thought



<P>his introduction at Mansfield by no means desirable.



<P>Mr. Bertram's acquaintance with him had begun at Weymouth,



<P>where they had spent ten days together in the same society,



<P>and the friendship, if friendship it might be called,



<P>had been proved and perfected by Mr. Yates's being invited



<P>to take Mansfield in his way, whenever he could, and by his



<P>promising to come; and he did come rather earlier than had



<P>been expected, in consequence of the sudden breaking-up



<P>of a large party assembled for gaiety at the house



<P>of another friend, which he had left Weymouth to join.



<P>He came on the wings of disappointment, and with his head



<P>full of acting, for it had been a theatrical party;



<P>and the play in which he had borne a part was within



<P>two days of representation, when the sudden death



<P>of one of the nearest connexions of the family had



<P>destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers.



<P>To be so near happiness, so near fame, so near the long



<P>paragraph in praise of the private theatricals at Ecclesford,



<P>the seat of the Right Hon. Lord Ravenshaw, in Cornwall,



<P>which would of course have immortalised the whole party



<P>for at least a twelvemonth! and being so near, to lose



<P>it all, was an injury to be keenly felt, and Mr. Yates



<P>could talk of nothing else.&nbsp; Ecclesford and its theatre,



<P>with its arrangements and dresses, rehearsals and jokes,



<P>was his never-failing subject, and to boast of the past his



<P>only consolation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Happily for him, a love of the theatre is so general,



<P>an itch for acting so strong among young people, that he



<P>could hardly out-talk the interest of his hearers.



<P>From the first casting of the parts to the epilogue



<P>it was all bewitching, and there were few who did



<P>not wish to have been a party concerned, or would have



<P>hesitated to try their skill.&nbsp; The play had been Lovers'



<P>Vows, and Mr. Yates was to have been Count Cassel.



<P>"A trifling part," said he, "and not at all to my taste,



<P>and such a one as I certainly would not accept again;



<P>but I was determined to make no difficulties.



<P>Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two



<P>characters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford;



<P>and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to resign his to me,



<P>it was impossible to take it, you know.&nbsp; I was sorry



<P>for _him_ that he should have so mistaken his powers,



<P>for he was no more equal to the Baron--a little man



<P>with a weak voice, always hoarse after the first



<P>ten minutes.&nbsp; It must have injured the piece materially;



<P>but _I_ was resolved to make no difficulties.



<P>Sir Henry thought the duke not equal to Frederick,



<P>but that was because Sir Henry wanted the part himself;



<P>whereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two.



<P>I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick.



<P>Luckily the strength of the piece did not depend upon him.



<P>Our Agatha was inimitable, and the duke was thought very great



<P>by many.&nbsp; And upon the whole, it would certainly have gone



<P>off wonderfully."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was a hard case, upon my word"; and, "I do think you



<P>were very much to be pitied," were the kind responses



<P>of listening sympathy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is not worth complaining about; but to be sure the



<P>poor old dowager could not have died at a worse time;



<P>and it is impossible to help wishing that the news could



<P>have been suppressed for just the three days we wanted.



<P>It was but three days; and being only a grandmother,



<P>and all happening two hundred miles off, I think there would



<P>have been no great harm, and it was suggested, I know;



<P>but Lord Ravenshaw, who I suppose is one of the most correct



<P>men in England, would not hear of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"An afterpiece instead of a comedy," said Mr. Bertram.



<P>"Lovers' Vows were at an end, and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw



<P>left to act My Grandmother by themselves.&nbsp; Well, the jointure



<P>may comfort _him_; and perhaps, between friends, he began



<P>to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the Baron,



<P>and was not sorry to withdraw; and to make _you_ amends,



<P>Yates, I think we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield,



<P>and ask you to be our manager."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This, though the thought of the moment, did not end



<P>with the moment; for the inclination to act was awakened,



<P>and in no one more strongly than in him who was now



<P>master of the house; and who, having so much leisure



<P>as to make almost any novelty a certain good, had likewise



<P>such a degree of lively talents and comic taste,



<P>as were exactly adapted to the novelty of acting.



<P>The thought returned again and again.&nbsp; "Oh for the



<P>Ecclesford theatre and scenery to try something with."



<P>Each sister could echo the wish; and Henry Crawford,



<P>to whom, in all the riot of his gratifications it was



<P>yet an untasted pleasure, was quite alive at the idea.



<P>"I really believe," said he, "I could be fool enough



<P>at this moment to undertake any character that ever



<P>was written, from Shylock or Richard III down to the singing



<P>hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat.



<P>I feel as if I could be anything or everything;



<P>as if I could rant and storm, or sigh or cut capers,



<P>in any tragedy or comedy in the English language.&nbsp; Let us



<P>be doing something.&nbsp; Be it only half a play, an act, a scene;



<P>what should prevent us?&nbsp; Not these countenances, I am sure,"



<P>looking towards the Miss Bertrams; "and for a theatre,



<P>what signifies a theatre?&nbsp; We shall be only amusing ourselves.



<P>Any room in this house might suffice."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We must have a curtain," said Tom Bertram; "a few yards



<P>of green baize for a curtain, and perhaps that may be enough."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, quite enough," cried Mr. Yates, "with only just a side wing



<P>or two run up, doors in flat, and three or four scenes to be



<P>let down; nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this.



<P>For mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I believe we must be satisfied with _less_," said Maria.



<P>"There would not be time, and other difficulties



<P>would arise.&nbsp; We must rather adopt Mr. Crawford's views,



<P>and make the _performance_, not the_theatre_, our object.



<P>Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nay," said Edmund, who began to listen with alarm.



<P>"Let us do nothing by halves.&nbsp; If we are to act, let it be in



<P>a theatre completely fitted up with pit, boxes, and gallery,



<P>and let us have a play entire from beginning to end; so as it



<P>be a German play, no matter what, with a good tricking,



<P>shifting afterpiece, and a figure-dance, and a hornpipe,



<P>and a song between the acts.&nbsp; If we do not outdo Ecclesford,



<P>we do nothing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, Edmund, do not be disagreeable," said Julia.



<P>"Nobody loves a play better than you do, or can have gone



<P>much farther to see one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"True, to see real acting, good hardened real acting;



<P>but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to



<P>look at the raw efforts of those who have not been



<P>bred to the trade:&nbsp; a set of gentlemen and ladies,



<P>who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum



<P>to struggle through."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a short pause, however, the subject still continued,



<P>and was discussed with unabated eagerness, every one's



<P>inclination increasing by the discussion, and a knowledge



<P>of the inclination of the rest; and though nothing was settled



<P>but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy, and his sisters



<P>and Henry Crawford a tragedy, and that nothing in the world



<P>could be easier than to find a piece which would please



<P>them all, the resolution to act something or other seemed



<P>so decided as to make Edmund quite uncomfortable.&nbsp; He was



<P>determined to prevent it, if possible, though his mother,



<P>who equally heard the conversation which passed at table,



<P>did not evince the least disapprobation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The same evening afforded him an opportunity of trying



<P>his strength.&nbsp; Maria, Julia, Henry Crawford, and Mr. Yates



<P>were in the billiard-room. Tom, returning from them into



<P>the drawing-room, where Edmund was standing thoughtfully



<P>by the fire, while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at a



<P>little distance, and Fanny close beside her arranging



<P>her work, thus began as he entered--"Such a horribly vile



<P>billiard-table as ours is not to be met with, I believe,



<P>above ground.&nbsp; I can stand it no longer, and I think,



<P>I may say, that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again;



<P>but one good thing I have just ascertained:&nbsp; it is the very



<P>room for a theatre, precisely the shape and length for it;



<P>and the doors at the farther end, communicating with each other,



<P>as they may be made to do in five minutes, by merely moving



<P>the bookcase in my father's room, is the very thing we



<P>could have desired, if we had sat down to wish for it;



<P>and my father's room will be an excellent greenroom.



<P>It seems to join the billiard-room on purpose."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are not serious, Tom, in meaning to act?" said Edmund,



<P>in a low voice, as his brother approached the fire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not serious! never more so, I assure you.&nbsp; What is there



<P>to surprise you in it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think it would be very wrong.&nbsp; In a _general_ light,



<P>private theatricals are open to some objections, but as _we_



<P>are circumstanced, I must think it would be highly injudicious,



<P>and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind.



<P>It would shew great want of feeling on my father's account,



<P>absent as he is, and in some degree of constant danger;



<P>and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria,



<P>whose situation is a very delicate one, considering everything,



<P>extremely delicate."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You take up a thing so seriously! as if we were going



<P>to act three times a week till my father's return,



<P>and invite all the country.&nbsp; But it is not to be a



<P>display of that sort.&nbsp; We mean nothing but a little



<P>amusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene,



<P>and exercise our powers in something new.&nbsp; We want



<P>no audience, no publicity.&nbsp; We may be trusted, I think,



<P>in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable;



<P>and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us



<P>in conversing in the elegant written language of some



<P>respectable author than in chattering in words of our own.



<P>I have no fears and no scruples.&nbsp; And as to my father's



<P>being absent, it is so far from an objection, that I



<P>consider it rather as a motive; for the expectation



<P>of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother;



<P>and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety,



<P>and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks, I shall



<P>think our time very well spent, and so, I am sure, will he.



<P>It is a _very_ anxious period for her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he said this, each looked towards their mother.



<P>Lady Bertram, sunk back in one corner of the sofa,



<P>the picture of health, wealth, ease, and tranquillity,



<P>was just falling into a gentle doze, while Fanny was getting



<P>through the few difficulties of her work for her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund smiled and shook his head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By Jove! this won't do," cried Tom, throwing himself into



<P>a chair with a hearty laugh.&nbsp; "To be sure, my dear mother,



<P>your anxiety--I was unlucky there."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is the matter?" asked her ladyship, in the heavy



<P>tone of one half-roused; "I was not asleep."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh dear, no, ma'am, nobody suspected you!&nbsp; Well, Edmund,"



<P>he continued, returning to the former subject, posture,



<P>and voice, as soon as Lady Bertram began to nod again,



<P>"but _this_ I _will_ maintain, that we shall be doing



<P>no harm."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot agree with you; I am convinced that my father



<P>would totally disapprove it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I am convinced to the contrary.&nbsp; Nobody is fonder of



<P>the exercise of talent in young people, or promotes it more,



<P>than my father, and for anything of the acting, spouting,



<P>reciting kind, I think he has always a decided taste.



<P>I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys.&nbsp; How many a time



<P>have we mourned over the dead body of Julius Caesar,



<P>and to _be'd_ and not _to_ _be'd_, in this very room,



<P>for his amusement?&nbsp; And I am sure, _my_ _name_ _was_ _Norval_,



<P>every evening of my life through one Christmas holidays."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was a very different thing.&nbsp; You must see the



<P>difference yourself.&nbsp; My father wished us, as schoolboys,



<P>to speak well, but he would never wish his grown-up



<P>daughters to be acting plays.&nbsp; His sense of decorum is strict."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know all that," said Tom, displeased.&nbsp; "I know my father



<P>as well as you do; and I'll take care that his daughters



<P>do nothing to distress him.&nbsp; Manage your own concerns,



<P>Edmund, and I'll take care of the rest of the family."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you are resolved on acting," replied the persevering Edmund,



<P>"I must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way;



<P>and I think a theatre ought not to be attempted.



<P>It would be taking liberties with my father's house



<P>in his absence which could not be justified."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"For everything of that nature I will be answerable,"



<P>said Tom, in a decided tone.&nbsp; "His house shall not be hurt.



<P>I have quite as great an interest in being careful



<P>of his house as you can have; and as to such alterations



<P>as I was suggesting just now, such as moving a bookcase,



<P>or unlocking a door, or even as using the billiard-room



<P>for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it,



<P>you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting



<P>more in this room, and less in the breakfast-room, than



<P>we did before he went away, or to my sister's pianoforte



<P>being moved from one side of the room to the other.



<P>Absolute nonsense!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The innovation, if not wrong as an innovation, will be



<P>wrong as an expense."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious!



<P>Perhaps it might cost a whole twenty pounds.&nbsp; Something of



<P>a theatre we must have undoubtedly, but it will be on the



<P>simplest plan:&nbsp; a green curtain and a little carpenter's work,



<P>and that's all; and as the carpenter's work may be all



<P>done at home by Christopher Jackson himself, it will be



<P>too absurd to talk of expense; and as long as Jackson



<P>is employed, everything will be right with Sir Thomas.



<P>Don't imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge



<P>but yourself.&nbsp; Don't act yourself, if you do not like it,



<P>but don't expect to govern everybody else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, as to acting myself," said Edmund, "_that_ I



<P>absolutely protest against."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Tom walked out of the room as he said it, and Edmund was



<P>left to sit down and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, who had heard it all, and borne Edmund company



<P>in every feeling throughout the whole, now ventured to say,



<P>in her anxiety to suggest some comfort, "Perhaps they may



<P>not be able to find any play to suit them.&nbsp; Your brother's



<P>taste and your sisters' seem very different."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have no hope there, Fanny.&nbsp; If they persist in the scheme,



<P>they will find something.&nbsp; I shall speak to my sisters



<P>and try to dissuade _them_, and that is all I can do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dare say she would, but she has no influence with



<P>either Tom or my sisters that could be of any use;



<P>and if I cannot convince them myself, I shall let things



<P>take their course, without attempting it through her.



<P>Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all, and we had



<P>better do anything than be altogether by the ears."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His sisters, to whom he had an opportunity of speaking



<P>the next morning, were quite as impatient of his advice,



<P>quite as unyielding to his representation, quite as determined



<P>in the cause of pleasure, as Tom.&nbsp; Their mother had no



<P>objection to the plan, and they were not in the least afraid



<P>of their father's disapprobation.&nbsp; There could be no harm



<P>in what had been done in so many respectable families,



<P>and by so many women of the first consideration; and it



<P>must be scrupulousness run mad that could see anything to



<P>censure in a plan like theirs, comprehending only brothers



<P>and sisters and intimate friends, and which would never



<P>be heard of beyond themselves.&nbsp; Julia _did_ seem inclined



<P>to admit that Maria's situation might require particular



<P>caution and delicacy--but that could not extend to _her_--



<P>she was at liberty; and Maria evidently considered her



<P>engagement as only raising her so much more above restraint,



<P>and leaving her less occasion than Julia to consult



<P>either father or mother.&nbsp; Edmund had little to hope,



<P>but he was still urging the subject when Henry Crawford



<P>entered the room, fresh from the Parsonage, calling out,



<P>"No want of hands in our theatre, Miss Bertram.



<P>No want of understrappers:&nbsp; my sister desires her love,



<P>and hopes to be admitted into the company, and will be happy



<P>to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante,



<P>that you may not like to do yourselves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maria gave Edmund a glance, which meant, "What say you now?



<P>Can we be wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same?"



<P>And Edmund, silenced, was obliged to acknowledge that the



<P>charm of acting might well carry fascination to the mind



<P>of genius; and with the ingenuity of love, to dwell more



<P>on the obliging, accommodating purport of the message



<P>than on anything else.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The scheme advanced.&nbsp; Opposition was vain; and as to



<P>Mrs. Norris, he was mistaken in supposing she would wish



<P>to make any.&nbsp; She started no difficulties that were



<P>not talked down in five minutes by her eldest nephew



<P>and niece, who were all-powerful with her; and as the



<P>whole arrangement was to bring very little expense



<P>to anybody, and none at all to herself, as she foresaw



<P>in it all the comforts of hurry, bustle, and importance,



<P>and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself



<P>obliged to leave her own house, where she had been living



<P>a month at her own cost, and take up her abode in theirs,



<P>that every hour might be spent in their service, she was,



<P>in fact, exceedingly delighted with the project.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford _now_?"



<P>said Edmund the next day, after thinking some time on the



<P>subject himself.&nbsp; "How did you like her yesterday?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well--very much.&nbsp; I like to hear her talk.



<P>She entertains me; and she is so extremely pretty, that I



<P>have great pleasure in looking at her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is her countenance that is so attractive.&nbsp; She has



<P>a wonderful play of feature!&nbsp; But was there nothing in her



<P>conversation that struck you, Fanny, as not quite right?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh yes! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did.



<P>I was quite astonished.&nbsp; An uncle with whom she has been



<P>living so many years, and who, whatever his faults may be,



<P>is so very fond of her brother, treating him, they say,



<P>quite like a son.&nbsp; I could not have believed it!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought you would be struck.&nbsp; It was very wrong;



<P>very indecorous."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And very ungrateful, I think."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ungrateful is a strong word.&nbsp; I do not know that her uncle



<P>has any claim to her _gratitude_; his wife certainly had;



<P>and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt's memory



<P>which misleads her here.&nbsp; She is awkwardly circumstanced.



<P>With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be



<P>difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford,



<P>without throwing a shade on the Admiral.&nbsp; I do not pretend



<P>to know which was most to blame in their disagreements,



<P>though the Admiral's present conduct might incline one



<P>to the side of his wife; but it is natural and amiable



<P>that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely.



<P>I do not censure her _opinions_; but there certainly _is_



<P>impropriety in making them public."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do not you think," said Fanny, after a little consideration,



<P>"that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon



<P>Mrs. Crawford, as her niece has been entirely brought



<P>up by her?&nbsp; She cannot have given her right notions



<P>of what was due to the Admiral."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is a fair remark.&nbsp; Yes, we must suppose the faults



<P>of the niece to have been those of the aunt; and it makes



<P>one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under.



<P>But I think her present home must do her good.



<P>Mrs. Grant's manners are just what they ought to be.



<P>She speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, except as to his writing her such short letters.



<P>She made me almost laugh; but I cannot rate so very highly



<P>the love or good-nature of a brother who will not give



<P>himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading



<P>to his sisters, when they are separated.&nbsp; I am sure William



<P>would never have used _me_ so, under any circumstances.



<P>And what right had she to suppose that _you_ would not write



<P>long letters when you were absent?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The right of a lively mind, Fanny, seizing whatever



<P>may contribute to its own amusement or that of others;



<P>perfectly allowable, when untinctured by ill-humour



<P>or roughness; and there is not a shadow of either in the



<P>countenance or manner of Miss Crawford:&nbsp; nothing sharp,



<P>or loud, or coarse.&nbsp; She is perfectly feminine, except m



<P>the instances we have been speaking of.&nbsp; There she cannot



<P>be justified.&nbsp; I am glad you saw it all as I did."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Having formed her mind and gained her affections, he had a



<P>good chance of her thinking like him; though at this period,



<P>and on this subject, there began now to be some danger



<P>of dissimilarity, for he was in a line of admiration



<P>of Miss Crawford, which might lead him where Fanny could



<P>not follow.&nbsp; Miss Crawford's attractions did not lessen.



<P>The harp arrived, and rather added to her beauty, wit,



<P>and good-humour; for she played with the greatest obligingness,



<P>with an expression and taste which were peculiarly becoming,



<P>and there was something clever to be said at the close



<P>of every air.&nbsp; Edmund was at the Parsonage every day,



<P>to be indulged with his favourite instrument:



<P>one morning secured an invitation for the next;



<P>for the lady could not be unwilling to have a listener,



<P>and every thing was soon in a fair train.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A young woman, pretty, lively, with a harp as



<P>elegant as herself, and both placed near a window,



<P>cut down to the ground, and opening on a little lawn,



<P>surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer,



<P>was enough to catch any man's heart.&nbsp; The season, the scene,



<P>the air, were all favourable to tenderness and sentiment.



<P>Mrs. Grant and her tambour frame were not without their use:



<P>it was all in harmony; and as everything will turn to account



<P>when love is once set going, even the sandwich tray,



<P>and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it, were worth looking at.



<P>Without studying the business, however, or knowing



<P>what he was about, Edmund was beginning, at the end



<P>of a week of such intercourse, to be a good deal in love;



<P>and to the credit of the lady it may be added that,



<P>without his being a man of the world or an elder brother,



<P>without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of



<P>small talk, he began to be agreeable to her.&nbsp; She felt it



<P>to be so, though she had not foreseen, and could hardly



<P>understand it; for he was not pleasant by any common rule:



<P>he talked no nonsense; he paid no compliments; his opinions



<P>were unbending, his attentions tranquil and simple.



<P>There was a charm, perhaps, in his sincerity, his steadiness,



<P>his integrity, which Miss Crawford might be equal



<P>to feel, though not equal to discuss with herself.



<P>She did not think very much about it, however:&nbsp; he pleased



<P>her for the present; she liked to have him near her;



<P>it was enough.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage



<P>every morning; she would gladly have been there too,



<P>might she have gone in uninvited and unnoticed, to hear



<P>the harp; neither could she wonder that, when the evening



<P>stroll was over, and the two families parted again,



<P>he should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her



<P>sister to their home, while Mr. Crawford was devoted



<P>to the ladies of the Park; but she thought it a very



<P>bad exchange; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine



<P>and water for her, would rather go without it than not.



<P>She was a little surprised that he could spend so many



<P>hours with Miss Crawford, and not see more of the sort



<P>of fault which he had already observed, and of which _she_



<P>was almost always reminded by a something of the same



<P>nature whenever she was in her company; but so it was.



<P>Edmund was fond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford,



<P>but he seemed to think it enough that the Admiral had



<P>since been spared; and she scrupled to point out her own



<P>remarks to him, lest it should appear like ill-nature.



<P>The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her



<P>was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride,



<P>which the former caught, soon after her being settled



<P>at Mansfield, from the example of the young ladies at the Park,



<P>and which, when Edmund's acquaintance with her increased,



<P>led to his encouraging the wish, and the offer of his own



<P>quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts, as the best



<P>fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish.



<P>No pain, no injury, however, was designed by him to his



<P>cousin in this offer:&nbsp; _she_ was not to lose a day's exercise



<P>by it.&nbsp; The mare was only to be taken down to the Parsonage



<P>half an hour before her ride were to begin; and Fanny,



<P>on its being first proposed, so far from feeling slighted,



<P>was almost over-powered with gratitude that he should be



<P>asking her leave for it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford made her first essay with great credit



<P>to herself, and no inconvenience to Fanny.&nbsp; Edmund,



<P>who had taken down the mare and presided at the whole,



<P>returned with it in excellent time, before either Fanny



<P>or the steady old coachman, who always attended her when



<P>she rode without her cousins, were ready to set forward.



<P>The second day's trial was not so guiltless.&nbsp; Miss Crawford's



<P>enjoyment of riding was such that she did not know how to



<P>leave off.&nbsp; Active and fearless, and though rather small,



<P>strongly made, she seemed formed for a horsewoman; and to



<P>the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise, something was



<P>probably added in Edmund's attendance and instructions,



<P>and something more in the conviction of very much surpassing



<P>her sex in general by her early progress, to make her



<P>unwilling to dismount.&nbsp; Fanny was ready and waiting,



<P>and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for not being gone,



<P>and still no horse was announced, no Edmund appeared.



<P>To avoid her aunt, and look for him, she went out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The houses, though scarcely half a mile apart, were not



<P>within sight of each other; but, by walking fifty yards



<P>from the hall door, she could look down the park,



<P>and command a view of the Parsonage and all its demesnes,



<P>gently rising beyond the village road; and in Dr. Grant's



<P>meadow she immediately saw the group--Edmund and Miss



<P>Crawford both on horse-back, riding side by side, Dr. and



<P>Mrs. Grant, and Mr. Crawford, with two or three grooms,



<P>standing about and looking on.&nbsp; A happy party it appeared



<P>to her, all interested in one object:&nbsp; cheerful beyond



<P>a doubt, for the sound of merriment ascended even to her.



<P>It was a sound which did not make _her_ cheerful;



<P>she wondered that Edmund should forget her, and felt



<P>a pang.&nbsp; She could not turn her eyes from the meadow;



<P>she could not help watching all that passed.&nbsp; At first Miss



<P>Crawford and her companion made the circuit of the field,



<P>which was not small, at a foot's pace; then, at _her_



<P>apparent suggestion, they rose into a canter; and to Fanny's



<P>timid nature it was most astonishing to see how well



<P>she sat.&nbsp; After a few minutes they stopped entirely.



<P>Edmund was close to her; he was speaking to her;



<P>he was evidently directing her management of the bridle;



<P>he had hold of her hand; she saw it, or the imagination



<P>supplied what the eye could not reach.&nbsp; She

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>must not wonder at all this; what could be more natural



<P>than that Edmund should be making himself useful,



<P>and proving his good-nature by any one?&nbsp; She could not



<P>but think, indeed, that Mr. Crawford might as well have



<P>saved him the trouble; that it would have been particularly



<P>proper and becoming in a brother to have done it himself;



<P>but Mr. Crawford, with all his boasted good-nature, and all



<P>his coachmanship, probably knew nothing of the matter,



<P>and had no active kindness in comparison of Edmund.



<P>She began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have



<P>such double duty; if she were forgotten, the poor mare



<P>should be remembered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little



<P>tranquillised by seeing the party in the meadow disperse,



<P>and Miss Crawford still on horseback, but attended by Edmund



<P>on foot, pass through a gate into the lane, and so into



<P>the park, and make towards the spot where she stood.



<P>She began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient;



<P>and walked to meet them with a great anxiety to avoid



<P>the suspicion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Miss Price," said Miss Crawford, as soon as she



<P>was at all within hearing, "I am come to make my own



<P>apologies for keeping you waiting; but I have nothing



<P>in the world to say for myself--I knew it was very late,



<P>and that I was behaving extremely ill; and therefore,



<P>if you please, you must forgive me.&nbsp; Selfishness must



<P>always be forgiven, you know, because there is no hope



<P>of a cure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's answer was extremely civil, and Edmund added



<P>his conviction that she could be in no hurry.&nbsp; "For there



<P>is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice



<P>as far as she ever goes," said he, "and you have been



<P>promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off



<P>half an hour sooner:&nbsp; clouds are now coming up, and she



<P>will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then.



<P>I wish _you_ may not be fatigued by so much exercise.



<P>I wish you had saved yourself this walk home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse,



<P>I assure you," said she, as she sprang down with his help;



<P>"I am very strong.&nbsp; Nothing ever fatigues me but doing



<P>what I do not like.&nbsp; Miss Price, I give way to you with



<P>a very bad grace; but I sincerely hope you will have



<P>a pleasant ride, and that I may have nothing but good



<P>to hear of this dear, delightful, beautiful animal."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The old coachman, who had been waiting about with his



<P>own horse, now joining them, Fanny was lifted on hers,



<P>and they set off across another part of the park;



<P>her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing,



<P>as she looked back, that the others were walking down



<P>the hill together to the village; nor did her attendant



<P>do her much good by his comments on Miss Crawford's great



<P>cleverness as a horse-woman, which he had been watching



<P>with an interest almost equal to her own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart



<P>for riding!" said he.&nbsp; "I never see one sit a horse better.



<P>She did not seem to have a thought of fear.&nbsp; Very different



<P>from you, miss, when you first began, six years ago come



<P>next Easter.&nbsp; Lord bless you! how you did tremble when Sir



<P>Thomas first had you put on!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the drawing-room Miss Crawford was also celebrated.



<P>Her merit in being gifted by Nature with strength



<P>and courage was fully appreciated by the Miss Bertrams;



<P>her delight in riding was like their own; her early



<P>excellence in it was like their own, and they had great



<P>pleasure in praising it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was sure she would ride well," said Julia; "she has



<P>the make for it.&nbsp; Her figure is as neat as her brother's."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," added Maria, "and her spirits are as good, and she



<P>has the same energy of character.&nbsp; I cannot but think



<P>that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she



<P>meant to ride the next day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I do not know--not if you want the mare," was her answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not want her at all for myself," said he;



<P>"'but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home,



<P>I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her a longer time--



<P>for a whole morning, in short.&nbsp; She has a great desire to get



<P>as far as Mansfield Common:&nbsp; Mrs. Grant has been telling



<P>her of its fine views, and I have no doubt of her being



<P>perfectly equal to it.&nbsp; But any morning will do for this.



<P>She would be extremely sorry to interfere with you.



<P>It would be very wrong if she did.&nbsp; _She_ rides only



<P>for pleasure; _you_ for health."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall not ride to-morrow, certainly," said Fanny;



<P>"I have been out very often lately, and would rather



<P>stay at home.&nbsp; You know I am strong enough now to walk



<P>very well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund looked pleased, which must be Fanny's comfort,



<P>and the ride to Mansfield Common took place the next morning:



<P>the party included all the young people but herself,



<P>and was much enjoyed at the time, and doubly enjoyed



<P>again in the evening discussion.&nbsp; A successful scheme



<P>of this sort generally brings on another; and the having



<P>been to Mansfield Common disposed them all for going



<P>somewhere else the day after.&nbsp; There were many other



<P>views to be shewn; and though the weather was hot,



<P>there were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go.



<P>A young party is always provided with a shady lane.



<P>Four fine mornings successively were spent in this manner,



<P>in shewing the Crawfords the country, and doing the



<P>honours of its finest spots.&nbsp; Everything answered;



<P>it was all gaiety and good-humour, the heat only supplying



<P>inconvenience enough to be talked of with pleasure--



<P>till the fourth day, when the happiness of one of the party



<P>was exceedingly clouded.&nbsp; Miss Bertram was the one.



<P>Edmund and Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage,



<P>and _she_ was excluded.&nbsp; It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant,



<P>with perfect good-humour, on Mr. Rushworth's account,



<P>who was partly expected at the Park that day; but it was felt



<P>as a very grievous injury, and her good manners were severely



<P>taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home.



<P>As Mr. Rushworth did _not_ come, the injury was increased,



<P>and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over him;



<P>she could only be sullen to her mother, aunt, and cousin,



<P>and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner



<P>and dessert.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the



<P>drawing-room, fresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful,



<P>the very reverse of what they found in the three ladies



<P>sitting there, for Maria would scarcely raise her eyes



<P>from her book, and Lady Bertram was half-asleep; and even



<P>Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece's ill-humour,



<P>and having asked one or two questions about the dinner,



<P>which were not immediately attended to, seemed almost



<P>determined to say no more.&nbsp; For a few minutes the brother



<P>and sister were too eager in their praise of the night



<P>and their remarks on the stars, to think beyond themselves;



<P>but when the first pause came, Edmund, looking around,



<P>said, "But where is Fanny?&nbsp; Is she gone to bed?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, not that I know of," replied Mrs. Norris; "she was



<P>here a moment ago."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her own gentle voice speaking from the other end



<P>of the room, which was a very long one, told them



<P>that she was on the sofa.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris began scolding.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is a very foolish trick, Fanny, to be idling away all



<P>the evening upon a sofa.&nbsp; Why cannot you come and sit here,



<P>and employ yourself as _we_ do?&nbsp; If you have no work



<P>of your own, I can supply you from the poor basket.



<P>There is all the new calico, that was bought last week,



<P>not touched yet.&nbsp; I am sure I almost broke my back



<P>by cutting it out.&nbsp; You should learn to think of



<P>other people; and, take my word for it, it is a shocking



<P>trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before half this was said, Fanny was returned to her



<P>seat at the table, and had taken up her work again;



<P>and Julia, who was in high good-humour, from the pleasures



<P>of the day, did her the justice of exclaiming, "I must say,



<P>ma'am, that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody



<P>in the house."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Fanny," said Edmund, after looking at her attentively,



<P>"I am sure you have the headache."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could not deny it, but said it was not very bad.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can hardly believe you," he replied; "I know your looks



<P>too well.&nbsp; How long have you had it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Since a little before dinner.&nbsp; It is nothing but the heat."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did you go out in the heat?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go out! to be sure she did," said Mrs. Norris:



<P>"would you have her stay within such a fine day as this?



<P>Were not we _all_ out?&nbsp; Even your mother was out to-day



<P>for above an hour."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, indeed, Edmund," added her ladyship, who had been



<P>thoroughly awakened by Mrs. Norris's sharp reprimand



<P>to Fanny; "I was out above an hour.&nbsp; I sat three-quarters



<P>of an hour in the flower-garden, while Fanny cut the roses;



<P>and very pleasant it was, I assure you, but very hot.



<P>It was shady enough in the alcove, but I declare I quite



<P>dreaded the coming home again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Fanny has been cutting roses, has she?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, and I am afraid they will be the last this year.



<P>Poor thing!&nbsp; _She_ found it hot enough; but they were so



<P>full-blown that one could not wait."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There was no help for it, certainly," rejoined Mrs. Norris,



<P>in a rather softened voice; "but I question whether her



<P>headache might not be caught _then_, sister.&nbsp; There is



<P>nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping



<P>in a hot sun; but I dare say it will be well to-morrow.



<P>Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar; I always



<P>forget to have mine filled."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She has got it," said Lady Bertram; "she has had it ever



<P>since she came back from your house the second time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What!" cried Edmund; "has she been walking as well as



<P>cutting roses; walking across the hot park to your house,



<P>and doing it twice, ma'am?&nbsp; No wonder her head aches."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris was talking to Julia, and did not hear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was afraid it would be too much for her," said Lady Bertram;



<P>"but when the roses were gathered, your aunt wished



<P>to have them, and then you know they must be taken home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry;



<P>and, unluckily, Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room



<P>and bring away the key, so she was obliged to go again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund got up and walked about the room, saying, "And could



<P>nobody be employed on such an errand but Fanny?&nbsp; Upon my word,



<P>ma'am, it has been a very ill-managed business."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better,"



<P>cried Mrs. Norris, unable to be longer deaf; "unless I had



<P>gone myself, indeed; but I cannot be in two places at once;



<P>and I was talking to Mr. Green at that very time about



<P>your mother's dairymaid, by _her_ desire, and had promised



<P>John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son,



<P>and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour.



<P>I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon



<P>any occasion, but really I cannot do everything at once.



<P>And as for Fanny's just stepping down to my house for me--



<P>it is not much above a quarter of a mile--I cannot think I



<P>was unreasonable to ask it.&nbsp; How often do I pace it three



<P>times a day, early and late, ay, and in all weathers too,



<P>and say nothing about it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish Fanny had half your strength, ma'am."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise, she would



<P>not be knocked up so soon.&nbsp; She has not been out on



<P>horseback now this long while, and I am persuaded that,



<P>when she does not ride, she ought to walk.&nbsp; If she had



<P>been riding before, I should not have asked it of her.



<P>But I thought it would rather do her good after being



<P>stooping among the roses; for there is nothing so



<P>refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind;



<P>and though the sun was strong, it was not so very hot.



<P>Between ourselves, Edmund," nodding significantly at



<P>his mother, "it was cutting the roses, and dawdling



<P>about in the flower-garden, that did the mischief."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am afraid it was, indeed," said the more candid



<P>Lady Bertram, who had overheard her; "I am very much afraid



<P>she caught the headache there, for the heat was enough



<P>to kill anybody.&nbsp; It was as much as I could bear myself.



<P>Sitting and calling to Pug, and trying to keep him from



<P>the flower-beds, was almost too much for me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund said no more to either lady; but going quietly



<P>to another table, on which the supper-tray yet remained,



<P>brought a glass of Madeira to Fanny, and obliged her to drink



<P>the greater part.&nbsp; She wished to be able to decline it;



<P>but the tears, which a variety of feelings created,



<P>made it easier to swallow than to speak.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Vexed as Edmund was with his mother and aunt, he was still



<P>more angry with himself.&nbsp; His own forgetfulness of her was



<P>worse than anything which they had done.&nbsp; Nothing of this



<P>would have happened had she been properly considered;



<P>but she had been left four days together without any choice



<P>of companions or exercise, and without any excuse for



<P>avoiding whatever her unreasonable aunts might require.



<P>He was ashamed to think that for four days together she had



<P>not had the power of riding, and very seriously resolved,



<P>however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of Miss



<P>Crawford's, that it should never happen again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny went to bed with her heart as full as on the first



<P>evening of her arrival at the Park.&nbsp; The state of her



<P>spirits had probably had its share in her indisposition;



<P>for she had been feeling neglected, and been struggling



<P>against discontent and envy for some days past.



<P>As she leant on the sofa, to which she had retreated



<P>that she might not be seen, the pain of her mind



<P>had been much beyond that in her head; and the sudden



<P>change which Edmund's kindness had then occasioned,



<P>made her hardly know how to support herself.

<B>CHAPTER VI</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Mr. Bertram set off for--------, and Miss Crawford



<P>was prepared to find a great chasm in their society,



<P>and to miss him decidedly in the meetings which were now



<P>becoming almost daily between the families; and on their



<P>all dining together at the Park soon after his going,



<P>she retook her chosen place near the bottom of the table,



<P>fully expecting to feel a most melancholy difference in



<P>the change of masters.&nbsp; It would be a very flat business,



<P>she was sure.&nbsp; In comparison with his brother, Edmund would



<P>have nothing to say.&nbsp; The soup would be sent round in a



<P>most spiritless manner, wine drank without any smiles



<P>or agreeable trifling, and the venison cut up without



<P>supplying one pleasant anecdote of any former haunch,



<P>or a single entertaining story, about "my friend such a one."



<P>She must try to find amusement in what was passing at the



<P>upper end of the table, and in observing Mr. Rushworth,



<P>who was now making his appearance at Mansfield for the first



<P>time since the Crawfords' arrival.&nbsp; He had been visiting



<P>a friend in the neighbouring county, and that friend



<P>having recently had his grounds laid out by an improver,



<P>Mr. Rushworth was returned with his head full of the subject,



<P>and very eager to be improving his own place in the same way;



<P>and though not saying much to the purpose, could talk



<P>of nothing else.&nbsp; The subject had been already handled



<P>in the drawing-room; it was revived in the dining-parlour.



<P>Miss Bertram's attention and opinion was evidently



<P>his chief aim; and though her deportment showed rather



<P>conscious superiority than any solicitude to oblige him,



<P>the mention of Sotherton Court, and the ideas attached



<P>to it, gave her a feeling of complacency, which prevented



<P>her from being very ungracious.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish you could see Compton," said he; "it is the most



<P>complete thing!&nbsp; I never saw a place so altered in my life.



<P>I told Smith I did not know where I was.&nbsp; The approach _now_,



<P>is one of the finest things in the country:&nbsp; you see the



<P>house in the most surprising manner.&nbsp; I declare, when I



<P>got back to Sotherton yesterday, it looked like a prison--



<P>quite a dismal old prison."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, for shame!" cried Mrs. Norris.&nbsp; "A prison indeed?



<P>Sotherton Court is the noblest old place in the world."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It wants improvement, ma'am, beyond anything.&nbsp; I never



<P>saw a place that wanted so much improvement in my life;



<P>and it is so forlorn that I do not know what can be done



<P>with it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present,"



<P>said Mrs. Grant to Mrs. Norris, with a smile; "but depend



<P>upon it, Sotherton will have _every_ improvement in time



<P>which his heart can desire."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I must try to do something with it," said Mr. Rushworth,



<P>"but I do not know what.&nbsp; I hope I shall have some good



<P>friend to help me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your best friend upon such an occasion," said Miss



<P>Bertram calmly, "would be Mr. Repton, I imagine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is what I was thinking of.&nbsp; As he has done so



<P>well by Smith, I think I had better have him at once.



<P>His terms are five guineas a day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, and if they were _ten_," cried Mrs. Norris,



<P>"I am sure _you_ need not regard it.&nbsp; The expense need



<P>not be any impediment.&nbsp; If I were you, I should not



<P>think of the expense.&nbsp; I would have everything done



<P>in the best style, and made as nice as possible.



<P>Such a place as Sotherton Court deserves everything that



<P>taste and money can do.&nbsp; You have space to work upon there,



<P>and grounds that will well reward you.&nbsp; For my own part,



<P>if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size



<P>of Sotherton, I should be always planting and improving,



<P>for naturally I am excessively fond of it.&nbsp; It would be



<P>too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where I am now,



<P>with my little half acre.&nbsp; It would be quite a burlesque.



<P>But if I had more room, I should take a prodigious delight



<P>in improving and planting.&nbsp; We did a vast deal in that way



<P>at the Parsonage:&nbsp; we made it quite a different place



<P>from what it was when we first had it.&nbsp; You young ones



<P>do not remember much about it, perhaps; but if dear Sir



<P>Thomas were here, he could tell you what improvements



<P>we made:&nbsp; and a great deal more would have been done,



<P>but for poor Mr. Norris's sad state of health.&nbsp; He could



<P>hardly ever get out, poor man, to enjoy anything, and _that_



<P>disheartened me from doing several things that Sir Thomas



<P>and I used to talk of.&nbsp; If it had not been for _that_,



<P>we should have carried on the garden wall, and made the



<P>plantation to shut out the churchyard, just as Dr. Grant



<P>has done.&nbsp; We were always doing something as it was.



<P>It was only the spring twelvemonth before Mr. Norris's



<P>death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall,



<P>which is now grown such a noble tree, and getting



<P>to such perfection, sir," addressing herself then to



<P>Dr. Grant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The tree thrives well, beyond a doubt, madam," replied Dr. Grant.



<P>"The soil is good; and I never pass it without regretting



<P>that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sir, it is a Moor Park, we bought it as a Moor Park,



<P>and it cost us--that is, it was a present from Sir Thomas,



<P>but I saw the bill--and I know it cost seven shillings,



<P>and was charged as a Moor Park."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You were imposed on, ma'am," replied Dr. Grant:



<P>"these potatoes have as much the flavour of a Moor Park



<P>apricot as the fruit from that tree.&nbsp; It is an insipid



<P>fruit at the best; but a good apricot is eatable,



<P>which none from my garden are."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The truth is, ma'am," said Mrs. Grant, pretending to



<P>whisper across the table to Mrs. Norris, "that Dr. Grant



<P>hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is:



<P>he is scarcely ever indulged with one, for it is so



<P>valuable a fruit; with a little assistance, and ours is



<P>such a remarkably large, fair sort, that what with early



<P>tarts and preserves, my cook contrives to get them all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris, who had begun to redden, was appeased;



<P>and, for a little while, other subjects took place of the



<P>improvements of Sotherton.&nbsp; Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris



<P>were seldom good friends; their acquaintance had begun



<P>in dilapidations, and their habits were totally dissimilar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a short interruption Mr. Rushworth began again.



<P>"Smith's place is the admiration of all the country;



<P>and it was a mere nothing before Repton took it in hand.



<P>I think I shall have Repton."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Rushworth," said Lady Bertram, "if I were you,



<P>I would have a very pretty shrubbery.&nbsp; One likes to get



<P>out into a shrubbery in fine weather."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his



<P>acquiescence, and tried to make out something complimentary;



<P>but, between his submission to _her_ taste, and his having



<P>always intended the same himself, with the superadded



<P>objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies



<P>in general, and of insinuating that there was one only whom



<P>he was anxious to please, he grew puzzled, and Edmund was



<P>glad to put an end to his speech by a proposal of wine.



<P>Mr. Rushworth, however, though not usually a great talker,



<P>had still more to say on the subject next his heart.



<P>"Smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether



<P>in his grounds, which is little enough, and makes it more



<P>surprising that the place can have been so improved.



<P>Now, at Sotherton we have a good seven hundred,



<P>without reckoning the water meadows; so that I think,



<P>if so much could be done at Compton, we need not despair.



<P>There have been two or three fine old trees cut down, that grew



<P>too near the house, and it opens the prospect amazingly,



<P>which makes me think that Repton, or anybody of that sort,



<P>would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton down:&nbsp; the avenue



<P>that leads from the west front to the top of the hill,



<P>you know," turning to Miss Bertram particularly as he spoke.



<P>But Miss Bertram thought it most becoming to reply--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The avenue!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I do not recollect it.&nbsp; I really know



<P>very little of Sotherton."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, who was sitting on the other side of Edmund,



<P>exactly opposite Miss Crawford, and who had been attentively



<P>listening, now looked at him, and said in a low voice--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Cut down an avenue!&nbsp; What a pity!&nbsp; Does it not make you



<P>think of Cowper?&nbsp; 'Ye fallen avenues, once more I mourn



<P>your fate unmerited.'&nbsp; "

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He smiled as he answered, "I am afraid the avenue stands



<P>a bad chance, Fanny."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down,



<P>to see the place as it is now, in its old state; but I do



<P>not suppose I shall."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you never been there?&nbsp; No, you never can;



<P>and, unluckily, it is out of distance for a ride.



<P>I wish we could contrive it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! it does not signify.&nbsp; Whenever I do see it,



<P>you will tell me how it has been altered."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I collect," said Miss Crawford, "that Sotherton



<P>is an old place, and a place of some grandeur.



<P>In any particular style of building?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The house was built in Elizabeth's time, and is a large,



<P>regular, brick building; heavy, but respectable looking,



<P>and has many good rooms.&nbsp; It is ill placed.&nbsp; It stands



<P>in one of the lowest spots of the park; in that respect,



<P>unfavourable for improvement.&nbsp; But the woods are fine,



<P>and there is a stream, which, I dare say, might be made



<P>a good deal of.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth is quite right, I think,



<P>in meaning to give it a modern dress, and I have no doubt



<P>that it will be all done extremely well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford listened with submission, and said to herself,



<P>"He is a well-bred man; he makes the best of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth," he continued;



<P>"but, had I a place to new fashion, I should not put



<P>myself into the hands of an improver.&nbsp; I would rather



<P>have an inferior degree of beauty, of my own choice,



<P>and acquired progressively.&nbsp; I would rather abide by my own



<P>blunders than by his."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_You_ would know what you were about, of course;



<P>but that would not suit _me_.&nbsp; I have no eye or



<P>ingenuity for such matters, but as they are before me;



<P>and had I a place of my own in the country, I should be



<P>most thankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it,



<P>and give me as much beauty as he could for my money;



<P>and I should never look at it till it was complete."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It would be delightful to _me_ to see the progress



<P>of it all," said Fanny.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ay, you have been brought up to it.&nbsp; It was no part of



<P>my education; and the only dose I ever had, being administered



<P>by not the first favourite in the world, has made me consider



<P>improvements _in_ _hand_ as the greatest of nuisances.



<P>Three years ago the Admiral, my honoured uncle, bought a



<P>cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in;



<P>and my aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures;



<P>but it being excessively pretty, it was soon found



<P>necessary to be improved, and for three months we were



<P>all dirt and confusion, without a gravel walk to step on,



<P>or a bench fit for use.&nbsp; I would have everything as complete



<P>as possible in the country, shrubberies and flower-gardens,



<P>and rustic seats innumerable:&nbsp; but it must all be done



<P>without my care.&nbsp; Henry is different; he loves to be doing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund was sorry to hear Miss Crawford, whom he was much



<P>disposed to admire, speak so freely of her uncle.



<P>It did not suit his sense of propriety, and he was silenced,



<P>till induced by further smiles and liveliness to put



<P>the matter by for the present.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Bertram," said she, "I have tidings of my harp at last.



<P>I am assured that it is safe at Northampton; and there it



<P>has probably been these ten days, in spite of the solemn



<P>assurances we have so often received to the contrary."



<P>Edmund expressed his pleasure and surprise.&nbsp; "The truth is,



<P>that our inquiries were too direct; we sent a servant,



<P>we went ourselves:&nbsp; this will not do seventy miles from London;



<P>but this morning we heard of it in the right way.



<P>It was seen by some farmer, and he told the miller,



<P>and the miller told the butcher, and the butcher's



<P>son-in-law left word at the shop."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am very glad that you have heard of it, by whatever means,



<P>and hope there will be no further delay."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am to have it to-morrow; but how do you think it



<P>is to be conveyed?&nbsp; Not by a wagon or cart:&nbsp; oh no!



<P>nothing of that kind could be hired in the village.



<P>I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You would find it difficult, I dare say, just now,



<P>in the middle of a very late hay harvest, to hire a horse



<P>and cart?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it!



<P>To want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible,



<P>so I told my maid to speak for one directly; and as I cannot



<P>look out of my dressing-closet without seeing one farmyard,



<P>nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another,



<P>I thought it would be only ask and have, and was rather



<P>grieved that I could not give the advantage to all.



<P>Guess my surprise, when I found that I had been asking



<P>the most unreasonable, most impossible thing in the world;



<P>had offended all the farmers, all the labourers,



<P>all the hay in the parish!&nbsp; As for Dr. Grant's bailiff,



<P>I believe I had better keep out of _his_ way; and my



<P>brother-in-law himself, who is all kindness in general,



<P>looked rather black upon me when he found what I had



<P>been at."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You could not be expected to have thought on the subject before;



<P>but when you _do_ think of it, you must see the importance



<P>of getting in the grass.&nbsp; The hire of a cart at any time



<P>might not be so easy as you suppose:&nbsp; our farmers are



<P>not in the habit of letting them out; but, in harvest,



<P>it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall understand all your ways in time; but, coming down



<P>with the true London maxim, that everything is to be



<P>got with money, I was a little embarrassed at first



<P>by the sturdy independence of your country customs.



<P>However, I am to have my harp fetched to-morrow. Henry,



<P>who is good-nature itself, has offered to fetch



<P>it in his barouche.&nbsp; Will it not be honourably conveyed?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund spoke of the harp as his favourite instrument,



<P>and hoped to be soon allowed to hear her.&nbsp; Fanny had never



<P>heard the harp at all, and wished for it very much.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall be most happy to play to you both," said Miss



<P>Crawford; "at least as long as you can like to listen:



<P>probably much longer, for I dearly love music myself,



<P>and where the natural taste is equal the player must



<P>always be best off, for she is gratified in more ways



<P>than one.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Bertram, if you write to your brother,



<P>I entreat you to tell him that my harp is come:



<P>he heard so much of my misery about it.&nbsp; And you may say,



<P>if you please, that I shall prepare my most plaintive



<P>airs against his return, in compassion to his feelings,



<P>as I know his horse will lose."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I write, I will say whatever you wish me; but I do not,



<P>at present, foresee any occasion for writing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I dare say, nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth,



<P>would you ever write to him, nor he to you, if it could



<P>be helped.&nbsp; The occasion would never be foreseen.



<P>What strange creatures brothers are!&nbsp; You would not write



<P>to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world;



<P>and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse



<P>is ill, or such a relation dead, it is done in the fewest



<P>possible words.&nbsp; You have but one style among you.



<P>I know it perfectly.&nbsp; Henry, who is in every other respect



<P>exactly what a brother should be, who loves me, consults me,



<P>confides in me, and will talk to me by the hour together,



<P>has never yet turned the page in a letter; and very often



<P>it is nothing more than--'Dear Mary, I am just arrived.



<P>Bath seems full, and everything as usual.&nbsp; Yours sincerely.'



<P>That is the true manly style; that is a complete



<P>brother's letter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When they are at a distance from all their family,"



<P>said Fanny, colouring for William's sake, "they can write



<P>long letters."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Price has a brother at sea," said Edmund,



<P>"whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think



<P>you too severe upon us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"At sea, has she?&nbsp; In the king's service, of course?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story,



<P>but his determined silence obliged her to relate her



<P>brother's situation:&nbsp; her voice was animated in speaking



<P>of his profession, and the foreign stations he had been on;



<P>but she could not mention the number of years that he



<P>had been absent without tears in her eyes.&nbsp; Miss Crawford



<P>civilly wished him an early promotion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you know anything of my cousin's captain?" said Edmund;



<P>"Captain Marshall?&nbsp; You have a large acquaintance in the navy,



<P>I conclude?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Among admirals, large enough; but," with an air of grandeur,



<P>"we know very little of the inferior ranks.&nbsp; Post-captains may



<P>be very good sort of men, but they do not belong to _us_.



<P>Of various admirals I could tell you a great deal:



<P>of them and their flags, and the gradation of their pay,



<P>and their bickerings and jealousies.&nbsp; But, in general,



<P>I can assure you that they are all passed over, and all



<P>very ill used.&nbsp; Certainly, my home at my uncle's brought



<P>me acquainted with a circle of admirals.&nbsp; Of _Rears_ and



<P>_Vices_ I saw enough.&nbsp; Now do not be suspecting me of a pun,



<P>I entreat."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund again felt grave, and only replied, "It is



<P>a noble profession."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, the profession is well enough under two circumstances:



<P>if it make the fortune, and there be discretion in spending it;



<P>but, in short, it is not a favourite profession of mine.



<P>It has never worn an amiable form to _me_."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund reverted to the harp, and was again very happy



<P>in the prospect of hearing her play.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The subject of improving grounds, meanwhile, was still



<P>under consideration among the others; and Mrs. Grant could



<P>not help addressing her brother, though it was calling



<P>his attention from Miss Julia Bertram.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Henry, have _you_ nothing to say?&nbsp; You have been



<P>an improver yourself, and from what I hear of Everingham,



<P>it may vie with any place in England.&nbsp; Its natural beauties,



<P>I am sure, are great.&nbsp; Everingham, as it _used_ to be,



<P>was perfect in my estimation:&nbsp; such a happy fall of ground,



<P>and such timber!&nbsp; What would I not give to see it again?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your



<P>opinion of it," was his answer; "but I fear there would



<P>be some disappointment:&nbsp; you would not find it equal



<P>to your present ideas.&nbsp; In extent, it is a mere nothing;



<P>you would be surprised at its insignificance; and,



<P>as for improvement, there was very little for me to do--



<P>too little:&nbsp; I should like to have been busy much longer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are fond of the sort of thing?" said Julia.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Excessively; but what with the natural advantages of



<P>the ground, which pointed out, even to a very young eye,



<P>what little remained to be done, and my own consequent



<P>resolutions, I had not been of age three months before



<P>Everingham was all that it is now.&nbsp; My plan was laid



<P>at Westminster, a little altered, perhaps, at Cambridge,



<P>and at one-and-twenty executed.&nbsp; I am inclined to envy



<P>Mr. Rushworth for having so much happiness yet before him.



<P>I have been a devourer of my own."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Those who see quickly, will resolve quickly, and act quickly,"



<P>said Julia.&nbsp; "_You_ can never want employment.



<P>Instead of envying Mr. Rushworth, you should assist



<P>him with your opinion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Grant, hearing the latter part of this speech,



<P>enforced it warmly, persuaded that no judgment could



<P>be equal to her brother's; and as Miss Bertram caught



<P>at the idea likewise, and gave it her full support,



<P>declaring that, in her opinion, it was infinitely better



<P>to consult with friends and disinterested advisers,



<P>than immediately to throw the business into the hands of a



<P>professional man, Mr. Rushworth was very ready to request



<P>the favour of Mr. Crawford's assistance; and Mr. Crawford,



<P>after properly depreciating his own abilities, was quite at



<P>his service in any way that could be useful.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth



<P>then began to propose Mr. Crawford's doing him the honour



<P>of coming over to Sotherton, and taking a bed there;



<P>when Mrs. Norris, as if reading in her two nieces'



<P>minds their little approbation of a plan which was to take



<P>Mr. Crawford away, interposed with an amendment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford's willingness;



<P>but why should not more of us go?&nbsp; Why should not we



<P>make a little party?&nbsp; Here are many that would be



<P>interested in your improvements, my dear Mr. Rushworth,



<P>and that would like to hear Mr. Crawford's opinion on



<P>the spot, and that might be of some small use to you with



<P>_their_ opinions; and, for my own part, I have been long



<P>wishing to wait upon your good mother again; nothing but



<P>having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss;



<P>but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth,



<P>while the rest of you walked about and settled things,



<P>and then we could all return to a late dinner here,



<P>or dine at Sotherton, just as might be most agreeable to



<P>your mother, and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight.



<P>I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me



<P>in his barouche, and Edmund can go on horseback, you know,



<P>sister, and Fanny will stay at home with you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Bertram made no objection; and every one concerned in



<P>the going was forward in expressing their ready concurrence,



<P>excepting Edmund, who heard it all and said nothing.

<P><B>CHAPTER XII</B>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas was to return in November, and his eldest



<P>son had duties to call him earlier home.&nbsp; The approach



<P>of September brought tidings of Mr. Bertram, first in a



<P>letter to the gamekeeper and then in a letter to Edmund;



<P>and by the end of August he arrived himself, to be gay,



<P>agreeable, and gallant again as occasion served,



<P>or Miss Crawford demanded; to tell of races and Weymouth,



<P>and parties and friends, to which she might have listened



<P>six weeks before with some interest, and altogether



<P>to give her the fullest conviction, by the power



<P>of actual comparison, of her preferring his younger brother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was very vexatious, and she was heartily sorry for it;



<P>but so it was; and so far from now meaning to marry



<P>the elder, she did not even want to attract him beyond



<P>what the simplest claims of conscious beauty required:



<P>his lengthened absence from Mansfield, without anything



<P>but pleasure in view, and his own will to consult, made it



<P>perfectly clear that he did not care about her; and his



<P>indifference was so much more than equalled by her own,



<P>that were he now to step forth the owner of Mansfield Park,



<P>the Sir Thomas complete, which he was to be in time, she did



<P>not believe she could accept him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The season and duties which brought Mr. Bertram back to



<P>Mansfield took Mr. Crawford into Norfolk.&nbsp; Everingham could



<P>not do without him in the beginning of September.&nbsp; He went



<P>for a fortnight--a fortnight of such dullness to the Miss



<P>Bertrams as ought to have put them both on their guard,



<P>and made even Julia admit, in her jealousy of her sister,



<P>the absolute necessity of distrusting his attentions,



<P>and wishing him not to return; and a fortnight of sufficient



<P>leisure, in the intervals of shooting and sleeping, to have



<P>convinced the gentleman that he ought to keep longer away,



<P>had he been more in the habit of examining his own motives,



<P>and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity



<P>was tending; but, thoughtless and selfish from prosperity



<P>and bad example, he would not look beyond the present moment.



<P>The sisters, handsome, clever, and encouraging, were an



<P>amusement to his sated mind; and finding nothing in Norfolk



<P>to equal the social pleasures of Mansfield, he gladly



<P>returned to it at the time appointed, and was welcomed



<P>thither quite as gladly by those whom he came to trifle with



<P>further.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Maria, with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her, and doomed



<P>to the repeated details of his day's sport, good or bad,



<P>his boast of his dogs, his jealousy of his neighbours,



<P>his doubts of their qualifications, and his zeal after poachers,



<P>subjects which will not find their way to female feelings



<P>without some talent on one side or some attachment on



<P>the other, had missed Mr. Crawford grievously; and Julia,



<P>unengaged and unemployed, felt all the right of missing him



<P>much more.&nbsp; Each sister believed herself the favourite.



<P>Julia might be justified in so doing by the hints



<P>of Mrs. Grant, inclined to credit what she wished,



<P>and Maria by the hints of Mr. Crawford himself.



<P>Everything returned into the same channel as before his absence;



<P>his manners being to each so animated and agreeable



<P>as to lose no ground with either, and just stopping short



<P>of the consistence, the steadiness, the solicitude,



<P>and the warmth which might excite general notice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was the only one of the party who found anything



<P>to dislike; but since the day at Sotherton, she could never



<P>see Mr. Crawford with either sister without observation,



<P>and seldom without wonder or censure; and had her



<P>confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise



<P>of it in every other respect, had she been sure that she



<P>was seeing clearly, and judging candidly, she would



<P>probably have made some important communications to her



<P>usual confidant.&nbsp; As it was, however, she only hazarded



<P>a hint, and the hint was lost.&nbsp; "I am rather surprised,"



<P>said she, "that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon,



<P>after being here so long before, full seven weeks;



<P>for I had understood he was so very fond of change and



<P>moving about, that I thought something would certainly



<P>occur, when he was once gone, to take him elsewhere.



<P>He is used to much gayer places than Mansfield."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is to his credit," was Edmund's answer; "and I dare



<P>say it gives his sister pleasure.&nbsp; She does not like his



<P>unsettled habits."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What a favourite he is with my cousins!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, his manners to women are such as must please.



<P>Mrs. Grant, I believe, suspects him of a preference for Julia;



<P>I have never seen much symptom of it, but I wish it may



<P>be so.&nbsp; He has no faults but what a serious attachment



<P>would remove."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If Miss Bertram were not engaged," said Fanny cautiously,



<P>"I could sometimes almost think that he admired her more



<P>than Julia."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Which is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking



<P>Julia best, than you, Fanny, may be aware; for I believe



<P>it often happens that a man, before he has quite made up



<P>his own mind, will distinguish the sister or intimate



<P>friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than



<P>the woman herself Crawford has too much sense to stay



<P>here if he found himself in any danger from Maria;



<P>and I am not at all afraid for her, after such a proof



<P>as she has given that her feelings are not strong."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to



<P>think differently in future; but with all that submission



<P>to Edmund could do, and all the help of the coinciding



<P>looks and hints which she occasionally noticed in some



<P>of the others, and which seemed to say that Julia was



<P>Mr. Crawford's choice, she knew not always what to think.



<P>She was privy, one evening, to the hopes of her aunt



<P>Norris on the subject, as well as to her feelings,



<P>and the feelings of Mrs. Rushworth, on a point of some



<P>similarity, and could not help wondering as she listened;



<P>and glad would she have been not to be obliged to listen,



<P>for it was while all the other young people were dancing,



<P>and she sitting, most unwillingly, among the chaperons at



<P>the fire, longing for the re-entrance of her elder cousin,



<P>on whom all her own hopes of a partner then depended.



<P>It was Fanny's first ball, though without the preparation



<P>or splendour of many a young lady's first ball, being the



<P>thought only of the afternoon, built on the late acquisition



<P>of a violin player in the servants' hall, and the possibility



<P>of raising five couple with the help of Mrs. Grant and a new



<P>intimate friend of Mr. Bertram's just arrived on a visit.



<P>It had, however, been a very happy one to Fanny through



<P>four dances, and she was quite grieved to be losing



<P>even a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; While waiting and wishing,



<P>looking now at the dancers and now at the door, this dialogue



<P>between the two above-mentioned ladies was forced on her--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think, ma'am," said Mrs. Norris, her eyes directed



<P>towards Mr. Rushworth and Maria, who were partners for



<P>the second time, "we shall see some happy faces again now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, ma'am, indeed," replied the other, with a stately simper,



<P>"there will be some satisfaction in looking on _now_,



<P>and I think it was rather a pity they should have been



<P>obliged to part.&nbsp; Young folks in their situation



<P>should be excused complying with the common forms.



<P>I wonder my son did not propose it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dare say he did, ma'am. Mr. Rushworth is never remiss.



<P>But dear Maria has such a strict sense of propriety, so much



<P>of that true delicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays,



<P>Mrs. Rushworth--that wish of avoiding particularity!



<P>Dear ma'am, only look at her face at this moment;



<P>how different from what it was the two last dances!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Bertram did indeed look happy, her eyes were



<P>sparkling with pleasure, and she was speaking with



<P>great animation, for Julia and her partner, Mr. Crawford,



<P>were close to her; they were all in a cluster together.



<P>How she had looked before, Fanny could not recollect,



<P>for she had been dancing with Edmund herself, and had



<P>not thought about her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris continued, "It is quite delightful, ma'am, to



<P>see young people so properly happy, so well suited,



<P>and so much the thing!&nbsp; I cannot but think of dear Sir



<P>Thomas's delight.&nbsp; And what do you say, ma'am, to the chance



<P>of another match?&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth has set a good example,



<P>and such things are very catching."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Rushworth, who saw nothing but her son, was quite



<P>at a loss.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The couple above, ma'am. Do you see no symptoms there?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh dear!&nbsp; Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford.&nbsp; Yes, indeed,



<P>a very pretty match.&nbsp; What is his property?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Four thousand a year."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well.&nbsp; Those who have not more must be satisfied with



<P>what they have.&nbsp; Four thousand a year is a pretty estate,



<P>and he seems a very genteel, steady young man, so I hope



<P>Miss Julia will be very happy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is not a settled thing, ma'am, yet.&nbsp; We only speak of it



<P>among friends.&nbsp; But I have very little doubt it _will_ be.



<P>He is growing extremely particular in his attentions."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny could listen no farther.&nbsp; Listening and wondering were all



<P>suspended for a time, for Mr. Bertram was in the room again;



<P>and though feeling it would be a great honour to be asked



<P>by him, she thought it must happen.&nbsp; He came towards



<P>their little circle; but instead of asking her to dance,



<P>drew a chair near her, and gave her an account of the present



<P>state of a sick horse, and the opinion of the groom,



<P>from whom he had just parted.&nbsp; Fanny found that it was



<P>not to be, and in the modesty of her nature immediately



<P>felt that she had been unreasonable in expecting it.



<P>When he had told of his horse, he took a newspaper from



<P>the table, and looking over it, said in a languid way,



<P>"If you want to dance, Fanny, I will stand up with you."



<P>With more than equal civility the offer was declined;



<P>she did not wish to dance.&nbsp; "I am glad of it," said he,



<P>in a much brisker tone, and throwing down the newspaper



<P>again, "for I am tired to death.&nbsp; I only wonder how



<P>the good people can keep it up so long.&nbsp; They had need



<P>be _all_ in love, to find any amusement in such folly;



<P>and so they are, I fancy.&nbsp; If you look at them you may



<P>see they are so many couple of lovers--all but Yates



<P>and Mrs. Grant--and, between ourselves, she, poor woman,



<P>must want a lover as much as any one of them.&nbsp; A desperate



<P>dull life hers must be with the doctor," making a sly face



<P>as he spoke towards the chair of the latter, who proving,



<P>however, to be close at his elbow, made so instantaneous



<P>a change of expression and subject necessary, as Fanny,



<P>in spite of everything, could hardly help laughing at.



<P>"A strange business this in America, Dr. Grant!&nbsp; What is



<P>your opinion?&nbsp; I always come to you to know what I am to



<P>think of public matters."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Tom," cried his aunt soon afterwards, "as you



<P>are not dancing, I dare say you will have no objection



<P>to join us in a rubber; shall you?"&nbsp; Then leaving her seat,



<P>and coming to him to enforce the proposal, added in



<P>a whisper, "We want to make a table for Mrs. Rushworth,



<P>you know.&nbsp; Your mother is quite anxious about it,



<P>but cannot very well spare time to sit down herself,



<P>because of her fringe.&nbsp; Now, you and I and Dr. Grant will



<P>just do; and though _we_ play but half-crowns, you know,



<P>you may bet half-guineas with _him_."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should be most happy," replied he aloud, and jumping up



<P>with alacrity, "it would give me the greatest pleasure;



<P>but that I am this moment going to dance."&nbsp; Come, Fanny,



<P>taking her hand, "do not be dawdling any longer,



<P>or the dance will be over."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was led off very willingly, though it was impossible



<P>for her to feel much gratitude towards her cousin,



<P>or distinguish, as he certainly did, between the selfishness



<P>of another person and his own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A pretty modest request upon my word," he indignantly



<P>exclaimed as they walked away.&nbsp; "To want to nail me



<P>to a card-table for the next two hours with herself and



<P>Dr. Grant, who are always quarrelling, and that poking



<P>old woman, who knows no more of whist than of algebra.



<P>I wish my good aunt would be a little less busy!&nbsp; And to ask



<P>me in such a way too! without ceremony, before them all,



<P>so as to leave me no possibility of refusing.&nbsp; _That_ is



<P>what I dislike most particularly.&nbsp; It raises my spleen



<P>more than anything, to have the pretence of being asked,



<P>of being given a choice, and at the same time addressed



<P>in such a way as to oblige one to do the very thing,



<P>whatever it be!&nbsp; If I had not luckily thought of standing



<P>up with you I could not have got out of it.&nbsp; It is a great



<P>deal too bad.&nbsp; But when my aunt has got a fancy in her head,



<P>nothing can stop her."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Let other pens dwell on guilt and misery.&nbsp; I quit such odious



<P>subjects as soon as I can, impatient to restore everybody,



<P>not greatly in fault themselves, to tolerable comfort,



<P>and to have done with all the rest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My Fanny, indeed, at this very time, I have the satisfaction



<P>of knowing, must have been happy in spite of everything.



<P>She must have been a happy creature in spite of all that she felt,



<P>or thought she felt, for the distress of those around her.



<P>She had sources of delight that must force their way.



<P>She was returned to Mansfield Park, she was useful,



<P>she was beloved; she was safe from Mr. Crawford;



<P>and when Sir Thomas came back she had every proof that



<P>could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits,



<P>of his perfect approbation and increased regard;



<P>and happy as all this must make her, she would still have



<P>been happy without any of it, for Edmund was no longer



<P>the dupe of Miss Crawford.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It is true that Edmund was very far from happy himself.



<P>He was suffering from disappointment and regret,



<P>grieving over what was, and wishing for what could never be.



<P>She knew it was so, and was sorry; but it was with a



<P>sorrow so founded on satisfaction, so tending to ease,



<P>and so much in harmony with every dearest sensation,



<P>that there are few who might not have been glad to exchange



<P>their greatest gaiety for it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas, poor Sir Thomas, a parent, and conscious of errors



<P>in his own conduct as a parent, was the longest to suffer.



<P>He felt that he ought not to have allowed the marriage;



<P>that his daughter's sentiments had been sufficiently known



<P>to him to render him culpable in authorising it; that in so



<P>doing he had sacrificed the right to the expedient, and been



<P>governed by motives of selfishness and worldly wisdom.



<P>These were reflections that required some time to soften;



<P>but time will do almost everything; and though little



<P>comfort arose on Mrs. Rushworth's side for the misery she



<P>had occasioned, comfort was to be found greater than he had



<P>supposed in his other children.&nbsp; Julia's match became a less



<P>desperate business than he had considered it at first.



<P>She was humble, and wishing to be forgiven; and Mr. Yates,



<P>desirous of being really received into the family, was disposed



<P>to look up to him and be guided.&nbsp; He was not very solid;



<P>but there was a hope of his becoming less trifling,



<P>of his being at least tolerably domestic and quiet;



<P>and at any rate, there was comfort in finding his estate



<P>rather more, and his debts much less, than he had feared,



<P>and in being consulted and treated as the friend best



<P>worth attending to.&nbsp; There was comfort also in Tom,



<P>who gradually regained his health, without regaining the



<P>thoughtlessness and selfishness of his previous habits.



<P>He was the better for ever for his illness.&nbsp; He had suffered,



<P>and he had learned to think:&nbsp; two advantages that he had



<P>never known before; and the self-reproach arising from



<P>the deplorable event in Wimpole Street, to which he felt



<P>himself accessory by all the dangerous intimacy of his



<P>unjustifiable theatre, made an impression on his mind which,



<P>at the age of six-and-twenty, with no want of sense



<P>or good companions, was durable in its happy effects.



<P>He became what he ought to be:&nbsp; useful to his father,



<P>steady and quiet, and not living merely for himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here was comfort indeed! and quite as soon as Sir



<P>Thomas could place dependence on such sources of good,



<P>Edmund was contributing to his father's ease by improvement



<P>in the only point in which he had given him pain before--



<P>improvement in his spirits.&nbsp; After wandering about and



<P>sitting under trees with Fanny all the summer evenings,



<P>he had so well talked his mind into submission as to be



<P>very tolerably cheerful again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These were the circumstances and the hopes which gradually



<P>brought their alleviation to Sir Thomas, deadening his sense



<P>of what was lost, and in part reconciling him to himself;



<P>though the anguish arising from the conviction of his



<P>own errors in the education of his daughters was never



<P>to be entirely done away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Too late he became aware how unfavourable to the character



<P>of any young people must be the totally opposite treatment



<P>which Maria and Julia had been always experiencing at home,



<P>where the excessive indulgence and flattery of their aunt



<P>had been continually contrasted with his own severity.



<P>He saw how ill he had judged, in expecting to counteract



<P>what was wrong in Mrs. Norris by its reverse in himself;



<P>clearly saw that he had but increased the evil by teaching



<P>them to repress their spirits in his presence so as to make



<P>their real disposition unknown to him, and sending them



<P>for all their indulgences to a person who had been able



<P>to attach them only by the blindness of her affection,



<P>and the excess of her praise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here had been grievous mismanagement; but, bad as it was,



<P>he gradually grew to feel that it had not been the most



<P>direful mistake in his plan of education.&nbsp; Something must



<P>have been wanting _within_, or time would have worn



<P>away much of its ill effect.&nbsp; He feared that principle,



<P>active principle, had been wanting; that they had never



<P>been properly taught to govern their inclinations and



<P>tempers by that sense of duty which can alone suffice.



<P>They had been instructed theoretically in their religion,



<P>but never required to bring it into daily practice.



<P>To be distinguished for elegance and accomplishments,



<P>the authorised object of their youth, could have had no



<P>useful influence that way, no moral effect on the mind.



<P>He had meant them to be good, but his cares had been directed



<P>to the understanding and manners, not the disposition;



<P>and of the necessity of self-denial and humility,



<P>he feared they had never heard from any lips that could



<P>profit them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Bitterly did he deplore a deficiency which now he



<P>could scarcely comprehend to have been possible.



<P>Wretchedly did he feel, that with all the cost and care



<P>of an anxious and expensive education, he had brought up



<P>his daughters without their understanding their first duties,



<P>or his being acquainted with their character and temper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The high spirit and strong passions of Mrs. Rushworth,



<P>especially, were made known to him only in their sad result.



<P>She was not to be prevailed on to leave Mr. Crawford.



<P>She hoped to marry him, and they continued together



<P>till she was obliged to be convinced that such hope



<P>was vain, and till the disappointment and wretchedness



<P>arising from the conviction rendered her temper so bad,



<P>and her feelings for him so like hatred, as to make them



<P>for a while each other's punishment, and then induce



<P>a voluntary separation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had lived with him to be reproached as the ruin



<P>of all his happiness in Fanny, and carried away no better



<P>consolation in leaving him than that she _had_ divided them.



<P>What can exceed the misery of such a mind in such a situation?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Rushworth had no difficulty in procuring a divorce;



<P>and so ended a marriage contracted under such circumstances



<P>as to make any better end the effect of good luck not to



<P>be reckoned on.&nbsp; She had despised him, and loved another;



<P>and he had been very much aware that it was so.



<P>The indignities of stupidity, and the disappointments



<P>of selfish passion, can excite little pity.&nbsp; His punishment



<P>followed his conduct, as did a deeper punishment the



<P>deeper guilt of his wife.&nbsp; _He_ was released from the



<P>engagement to be mortified and unhappy, till some other



<P>pretty girl could attract him into matrimony again,



<P>and he might set forward on a second, and, it is to



<P>be hoped, more prosperous trial of the state:&nbsp; if duped,



<P>to be duped at least with good humour and good luck;



<P>while she must withdraw with infinitely stronger feelings



<P>to a retirement and reproach which could allow no second



<P>spring of hope or character.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Where she could be placed became a subject of most



<P>melancholy and momentous consultation.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris,



<P>whose attachment seemed to augment with the demerits



<P>of her niece, would have had her received at home and



<P>countenanced by them all.&nbsp; Sir Thomas would not hear of it;



<P>and Mrs. Norris's anger against Fanny was so much the greater,



<P>from considering _her_ residence there as the motive.



<P>She persisted in placing his scruples to _her_ account,



<P>though Sir Thomas very solemnly assured her that,



<P>had there been no young woman in question, had there



<P>been no young person of either sex belonging to him,



<P>to be endangered by the society or hurt by the character



<P>of Mrs. Rushworth, he would never have offered so great an



<P>insult to the neighbourhood as to expect it to notice her.



<P>As a daughter, he hoped a penitent one, she should be



<P>protected by him, and secured in every comfort, and supported



<P>by every encouragement to do right, which their relative



<P>situations admitted; but farther than _that_ he could not go.



<P>Maria had destroyed her own character, and he would not,



<P>by a vain attempt to restore what never could be restored,



<P>by affording his sanction to vice, or in seeking to lessen



<P>its disgrace, be anywise accessory to introducing such



<P>misery in another man's family as he had known himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It ended in Mrs. Norris's resolving to quit Mansfield



<P>and devote herself to her unfortunate Maria, and in an



<P>establishment being formed for them in another country,



<P>remote and private, where, shut up together with little society,



<P>on one side no affection, on the other no judgment,



<P>it may be reasonably supposed that their tempers became



<P>their mutual punishment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris's removal from Mansfield was the great supplementary



<P>comfort of Sir Thomas's life.&nbsp; His opinion of her had



<P>been sinking from the day of his return from Antigua:



<P>in every transaction together from that period, in their



<P>daily intercourse, in business, or in chat, she had been



<P>regularly losing ground in his esteem, and convincing



<P>him that either time had done her much disservice,



<P>or that he had considerably over-rated her sense,



<P>and wonderfully borne with her manners before.&nbsp; He had



<P>felt her as an hourly evil, which was so much the worse,



<P>as there seemed no chance of its ceasing but with life;



<P>she seemed a part of himself that must be borne for ever.



<P>To be relieved from her, therefore, was so great a



<P>felicity that, had she not left bitter remembrances



<P>behind her, there might have been danger of his learning



<P>almost to approve the evil which produced such a good.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was regretted by no one at Mansfield.&nbsp; She had never



<P>been able to attach even those she loved best; and since



<P>Mrs. Rushworth's elopement, her temper had been in a state



<P>of such irritation as to make her everywhere tormenting.



<P>Not even Fanny had tears for aunt Norris, not even when



<P>she was gone for ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That Julia escaped better than Maria was owing, in some measure,



<P>to a favourable difference of disposition and circumstance,



<P>but in a greater to her having been less the darling



<P>of that very aunt, less flattered and less spoilt.



<P>Her beauty and acquirements had held but a second place.



<P>She had been always used to think herself a little inferior



<P>to Maria.&nbsp; Her temper was naturally the easiest of the two;



<P>her feelings, though quick, were more controllable,



<P>and education had not given her so very hurtful a degree



<P>of self-consequence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had submitted the best to the disappointment



<P>in Henry Crawford.&nbsp; After the first bitterness of the



<P>conviction of being slighted was over, she had been



<P>tolerably soon in a fair way of not thinking of him again;



<P>and when the acquaintance was renewed in town,



<P>and Mr. Rushworth's house became Crawford's object,



<P>she had had the merit of withdrawing herself from it,



<P>and of chusing that time to pay a visit to her other friends,



<P>in order to secure herself from being again too much attracted.



<P>This had been her motive in going to her cousin's.



<P>Mr. Yates's convenience had had nothing to do with it.



<P>She had been allowing his attentions some time,



<P>but with very little idea of ever accepting him;



<P>and had not her sister's conduct burst forth as it did,



<P>and her increased dread of her father and of home,



<P>on that event, imagining its certain consequence to herself



<P>would be greater severity and restraint, made her hastily



<P>resolve on avoiding such immediate horrors at all risks,



<P>it is probable that Mr. Yates would never have succeeded.



<P>She had not eloped with any worse feelings than those



<P>of selfish alarm.&nbsp; It had appeared to her the only



<P>thing to be done.&nbsp; Maria's guilt had induced Julia's folly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Henry Crawford, ruined by early independence and bad



<P>domestic example, indulged in the freaks of a cold-blooded



<P>vanity a little too long.&nbsp; Once it had, by an opening



<P>undesigned and unmerited, led him into the way of happiness.



<P>Could he have been satisfied with the conquest of one



<P>amiable woman's affections, could he have found sufficient



<P>exultation in overcoming the reluctance, in working himself



<P>into the esteem and tenderness of Fanny Price, there would



<P>have been every probability of success and felicity for him.



<P>His affection had already done something.&nbsp; Her influence



<P>over him had already given him some influence over her.



<P>Would he have deserved more, there can be no doubt



<P>that more would have been obtained, especially when



<P>that marriage had taken place, which would have given



<P>him the assistance of her conscience in subduing her



<P>first inclination, and brought them very often together.



<P>Would he have persevered, and uprightly, Fanny must have



<P>been his reward, and a reward very voluntarily bestowed,



<P>within a reasonable period from Edmund's marrying Mary.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Had he done as he intended, and as he knew he ought,



<P>by going down to Everingham after his return from Portsmouth,



<P>he might have been deciding his own happy destiny.



<P>But he was pressed to stay for Mrs. Fraser's party;



<P>his staying was made of flattering consequence, and he



<P>was to meet Mrs. Rushworth there.&nbsp; Curiosity and vanity



<P>were both engaged, and the temptation of immediate pleasure



<P>was too strong for a mind unused to make any sacrifice



<P>to right:&nbsp; he resolved to defer his Norfolk journey,



<P>resolved that writing should answer the purpose of it,



<P>or that its purpose was unimportant, and staid.&nbsp; He saw



<P>Mrs. Rushworth, was received by her with a coldness which



<P>ought to have been repulsive, and have established apparent



<P>indifference between them for ever; but he was mortified,



<P>he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose



<P>smiles had been so wholly at his command:&nbsp; he must exert



<P>himself to subdue so proud a display of resentment; it was



<P>anger on Fanny's account; he must get the better of it,



<P>and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram again in her treatment



<P>of himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In this spirit he began the attack, and by animated



<P>perseverance had soon re-established the sort of familiar



<P>intercourse, of gallantry, of flirtation, which bounded



<P>his views; but in triumphing over the discretion which,



<P>though beginning in anger, might have saved them both,



<P>he had put himself in the power of feelings on her side



<P>more strong than he had supposed.&nbsp; She loved him;



<P>there was no withdrawing attentions avowedly dear to her.



<P>He was entangled by his own vanity, with as little



<P>excuse of love as possible, and without the smallest



<P>inconstancy of mind towards her cousin.&nbsp; To keep Fanny



<P>and the Bertrams from a knowledge of what was passing



<P>became his first object.&nbsp; Secrecy could not have been



<P>more desirable for Mrs. Rushworth's credit than he



<P>felt it for his own.&nbsp; When he returned from Richmond,



<P>he would have been glad to see Mrs. Rushworth no more.



<P>All that followed was the result of her imprudence;



<P>and he went off with her at last, because he could



<P>not help it, regretting Fanny even at the moment,



<P>but regretting her infinitely more when all the bustle of



<P>the intrigue was over, and a very few months had taught him,



<P>by the force of contrast, to place a yet higher value



<P>on the sweetness of her temper, the purity of her mind,



<P>and the excellence of her principles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That punishment, the public punishment of disgrace,



<P>should in a just measure attend _his_ share of the offence is,



<P>we know, not one of the barriers which society gives



<P>to virtue.&nbsp; In this world the penalty is less equal than



<P>could be wished; but without presuming to look forward



<P>to a juster appointment hereafter, we may fairly consider



<P>a man of sense, like Henry Crawford, to be providing



<P>for himself no small portion of vexation and regret:



<P>vexation that must rise sometimes to self-reproach, and



<P>regret to wretchedness, in having so requited hospitality,



<P>so injured family peace, so forfeited his best, most estimable,



<P>and endeared acquaintance, and so lost the woman whom



<P>he had rationally as well as passionately loved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After what had passed to wound and alienate the two families,



<P>the continuance of the Bertrams and Grants in such



<P>close neighbourhood would have been most distressing;



<P>but the absence of the latter, for some months purposely



<P>lengthened, ended very fortunately in the necessity,



<P>or at least the practicability, of a permanent removal.



<P>Dr. Grant, through an interest on which he had almost



<P>ceased to form hopes, succeeded to a stall in Westminster,



<P>which, as affording an occasion for leaving Mansfield,



<P>an excuse for residence in London, and an increase of



<P>income to answer the expenses of the change, was highly



<P>acceptable to those who went and those who staid.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Grant, with a temper to love and be loved, must have



<P>gone with some regret from the scenes and people she



<P>had been used to; but the same happiness of disposition



<P>must in any place, and any society, secure her a great



<P>deal to enjoy, and she had again a home to offer Mary;



<P>and Mary had had enough of her own friends, enough of vanity,



<P>ambition, love, and disappointment in the course of the



<P>last half-year, to be in need of the true kindness of her



<P>sister's heart, and the rational tranquillity of her ways.



<P>They lived together; and when Dr. Grant had brought



<P>on apoplexy and death, by three great institutionary



<P>dinners in one week, they still lived together; for Mary,



<P>though perfectly resolved against ever attaching herself



<P>to a younger brother again, was long in finding among



<P>the dashing representatives, or idle heir-apparents,



<P>who were at the command of her beauty, and her 20,000,



<P>any one who could satisfy the better taste she had acquired



<P>at Mansfield, whose character and manners could authorise



<P>a hope of the domestic happiness she had there learned



<P>to estimate, or put Edmund Bertram sufficiently out of her head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund had greatly the advantage of her in this respect.



<P>He had not to wait and wish with vacant affections for an



<P>object worthy to succeed her in them.&nbsp; Scarcely had he



<P>done regretting Mary Crawford, and observing to Fanny



<P>how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such



<P>another woman, before it began to strike him whether



<P>a very different kind of woman might not do just as well,



<P>or a great deal better:&nbsp; whether Fanny herself were not



<P>growing as dear, as important to him in all her smiles



<P>and all her ways, as Mary Crawford had ever been;



<P>and whether it might not be a possible, an hopeful



<P>undertaking to persuade her that her warm and sisterly



<P>regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion,



<P>that every one may be at liberty to fix their own,



<P>aware that the cure of unconquerable passions, and the



<P>transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as



<P>to time in different people.&nbsp; I only entreat everybody



<P>to believe that exactly at the time when it was quite



<P>natural that it should be so, and not a week earlier,



<P>Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford, and became



<P>as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With such a regard for her, indeed, as his had long been,



<P>a regard founded on the most endearing claims of innocence



<P>and helplessness, and completed by every recommendation



<P>of growing worth, what could be more natural than



<P>the change?&nbsp; Loving, guiding, protecting her, as he



<P>had been doing ever since her being ten years old,



<P>her mind in so great a degree formed by his care,



<P>and her comfort depending on his kindness, an object to him



<P>of such close and peculiar interest, dearer by all his



<P>own importance with her than any one else at Mansfield,



<P>what was there now to add, but that he should learn



<P>to prefer soft light eyes to sparkling dark ones.



<P>And being always with her, and always talking confidentially,



<P>and his feelings exactly in that favourable state



<P>which a recent disappointment gives, those soft light



<P>eyes could not be very long in obtaining the pre-eminence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Having once set out, and felt that he had done so on



<P>this road to happiness, there was nothing on the side



<P>of prudence to stop him or make his progress slow;



<P>no doubts of her deserving, no fears of opposition of taste,



<P>no need of drawing new hopes of happiness from dissimilarity



<P>of temper.&nbsp; Her mind, disposition, opinions, and habits



<P>wanted no half-concealment, no self-deception on the present,



<P>no reliance on future improvement.&nbsp; Even in the midst



<P>of his late infatuation, he had acknowledged Fanny's



<P>mental superiority.&nbsp; What must be his sense of it now,



<P>therefore?&nbsp; She was of course only too good for him;



<P>but as nobody minds having what is too good for them,



<P>he was very steadily earnest in the pursuit of the blessing,



<P>and it was not possible that encouragement from her should



<P>be long wanting.&nbsp; Timid, anxious, doubting as she was,



<P>it was still impossible that such tenderness as hers



<P>should not, at times, hold out the strongest hope of success,



<P>though it remained for a later period to tell him the whole



<P>delightful and astonishing truth.&nbsp; His happiness in knowing



<P>himself to have been so long the beloved of such a heart,



<P>must have been great enough to warrant any strength of



<P>language in which he could clothe it to her or to himself;



<P>it must have been a delightful happiness.&nbsp; But there



<P>was happiness elsewhere which no description can reach.



<P>Let no one presume to give the feelings of a young woman



<P>on receiving the assurance of that affection of which



<P>she has scarcely allowed herself to entertain a hope.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their own inclinations ascertained, there were no



<P>difficulties behind, no drawback of poverty or parent.



<P>It was a match which Sir Thomas's wishes had even forestalled.



<P>Sick of ambitious and mercenary connexions, prizing more



<P>and more the sterling good of principle and temper,



<P>and chiefly anxious to bind by the strongest securities



<P>all that remained to him of domestic felicity, he had



<P>pondered with genuine satisfaction on the more than



<P>possibility of the two young friends finding their natural



<P>consolation in each other for all that had occurred



<P>of disappointment to either; and the joyful consent



<P>which met Edmund's application, the high sense of having



<P>realised a great acquisition in the promise of Fanny



<P>for a daughter, formed just such a contrast with his



<P>early opinion on the subject when the poor little girl's



<P>coming had been first agitated, as time is for ever



<P>producing between the plans and decisions of mortals,



<P>for their own instruction, and their neighbours' entertainment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was indeed the daughter that he wanted.&nbsp; His charitable



<P>kindness had been rearing a prime comfort for himself.



<P>His liberality had a rich repayment, and the general



<P>goodness of his intentions by her deserved it.&nbsp; He might



<P>have made her childhood happier; but it had been an error



<P>of judgment only which had given him the appearance



<P>of harshness, and deprived him of her early love;



<P>and now, on really knowing each other, their mutual



<P>attachment became very strong.&nbsp; After settling her at



<P>Thornton Lacey with every kind attention to her comfort,



<P>the object of almost every day was to see her there,



<P>or to get her away from it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Selfishly dear as she had long been to Lady Bertram,



<P>she could not be parted with willingly by _her_.



<P>No happiness of son or niece could make her wish



<P>the marriage.&nbsp; But it was possible to part with her,



<P>because Susan remained to supply her place.



<P>Susan became the stationary niece, delighted to be so;



<P>and equally well adapted for it by a readiness of mind,



<P>and an inclination for usefulness, as Fanny had been



<P>by sweetness of temper, and strong feelings of gratitude.



<P>Susan could never be spared.&nbsp; First as a comfort to Fanny,



<P>then as an auxiliary, and last as her substitute,



<P>she was established at Mansfield, with every appearance



<P>of equal permanency.&nbsp; Her more fearless disposition



<P>and happier nerves made everything easy to her there.



<P>With quickness in understanding the tempers of those she



<P>had to deal with, and no natural timidity to restrain



<P>any consequent wishes, she was soon welcome and useful



<P>to all; and after Fanny's removal succeeded so naturally



<P>to her influence over the hourly comfort of her aunt,



<P>as gradually to become, perhaps, the most beloved of the two.



<P>In _her_ usefulness, in Fanny's excellence, in William's



<P>continued good conduct and rising fame, and in the general



<P>well-doing and success of the other members of the family,



<P>all assisting to advance each other, and doing credit



<P>to his countenance and aid, Sir Thomas saw repeated,



<P>and for ever repeated, reason to rejoice in what he had



<P>done for them all, and acknowledge the advantages of early



<P>hardship and discipline, and the consciousness of being born



<P>to struggle and endure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With so much true merit and true love, and no want of



<P>fortune and friends, the happiness of the married cousins



<P>must appear as secure as earthly happiness can be.



<P>Equally formed for domestic life, and attached to



<P>country pleasures, their home was the home of affection



<P>and comfort; and to complete the picture of good,



<P>the acquisition of Mansfield living, by the death of



<P>Dr. Grant, occurred just after they had been married long



<P>enough to begin to want an increase of income, and feel



<P>their distance from the paternal abode an inconvenience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On that event they removed to Mansfield; and the Parsonage



<P>there, which, under each of its two former owners, Fanny had



<P>never been able to approach but with some painful sensation



<P>of restraint or alarm, soon grew as dear to her heart,



<P>and as thoroughly perfect in her eyes, as everything else



<P>within the view and patronage of Mansfield Park had long been.

<BR>&nbsp;

<B>CHAPTER XL</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Fanny was right enough in not expecting to hear from Miss



<P>Crawford now at the rapid rate in which their correspondence



<P>had begun; Mary's next letter was after a decidedly longer



<P>interval than the last, but she was not right in supposing



<P>that such an interval would be felt a great relief



<P>to herself.&nbsp; Here was another strange revolution of mind!



<P>She was really glad to receive the letter when it did come.



<P>In her present exile from good society, and distance from



<P>everything that had been wont to interest her, a letter



<P>from one belonging to the set where her heart lived,



<P>written with affection, and some degree of elegance,



<P>was thoroughly acceptable.&nbsp; The usual plea of increasing



<P>engagements was made in excuse for not having



<P>written to her earlier; "And now that I have begun,"



<P>she continued, "my letter will not be worth your reading,



<P>for there will be no little offering of love at the end,



<P>no three or four lines _passionnees_ from the most



<P>devoted H. C. in the world, for Henry is in Norfolk;



<P>business called him to Everingham ten days ago,



<P>or perhaps he only pretended to call, for the sake of being



<P>travelling at the same time that you were.&nbsp; But there



<P>he is, and, by the bye, his absence may sufficiently account



<P>for any remissness of his sister's in writing, for there



<P>has been no 'Well, Mary, when do you write to Fanny?



<P>Is not it time for you to write to Fanny?' to spur me on.



<P>At last, after various attempts at meeting, I have seen



<P>your cousins, 'dear Julia and dearest Mrs. Rushworth';



<P>they found me at home yesterday, and we were glad to



<P>see each other again.&nbsp; We _seemed_ _very_ glad to see



<P>each other, and I do really think we were a little.



<P>We had a vast deal to say.&nbsp; Shall I tell you how



<P>Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was mentioned?



<P>I did not use to think her wanting in self-possession,



<P>but she had not quite enough for the demands of yesterday.



<P>Upon the whole, Julia was in the best looks of the two,



<P>at least after you were spoken of.&nbsp; There was no



<P>recovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke



<P>of 'Fanny,' and spoke of her as a sister should.



<P>But Mrs. Rushworth's day of good looks will come;



<P>we have cards for her first party on the 28th.&nbsp; Then she



<P>will be in beauty, for she will open one of the best



<P>houses in Wimpole Street.&nbsp; I was in it two years ago,



<P>when it was Lady Lascelle's, and prefer it to almost



<P>any I know in London, and certainly she will then feel,



<P>to use a vulgar phrase, that she has got her pennyworth



<P>for her penny.&nbsp; Henry could not have afforded her such



<P>a house.&nbsp; I hope she will recollect it, and be satisfied,



<P>as well as she may, with moving the queen of a palace,



<P>though the king may appear best in the background;



<P>and as I have no desire to tease her, I shall never _force_



<P>your name upon her again.&nbsp; She will grow sober by degrees.



<P>From all that I hear and guess, Baron Wildenheim's



<P>attentions to Julia continue, but I do not know that he



<P>has any serious encouragement.&nbsp; She ought to do better.



<P>A poor honourable is no catch, and I cannot imagine any



<P>liking in the case, for take away his rants, and the poor



<P>baron has nothing.&nbsp; What a difference a vowel makes!



<P>If his rents were but equal to his rants!&nbsp; Your cousin



<P>Edmund moves slowly; detained, perchance, by parish duties.



<P>There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted.



<P>I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a _young_ one.



<P>Adieu! my dear sweet Fanny, this is a long letter from London:



<P>write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry's eyes,



<P>when he comes back, and send me an account of all the dashing



<P>young captains whom you disdain for his sake."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was great food for meditation in this letter,



<P>and chiefly for unpleasant meditation; and yet, with all



<P>the uneasiness it supplied, it connected her with the absent,



<P>it told her of people and things about whom she had never



<P>felt so much curiosity as now, and she would have been



<P>glad to have been sure of such a letter every week.



<P>Her correspondence with her aunt Bertram was her only



<P>concern of higher interest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As for any society in Portsmouth, that could at all make



<P>amends for deficiencies at home, there were none within



<P>the circle of her father's and mother's acquaintance



<P>to afford her the smallest satisfaction:&nbsp; she saw nobody



<P>in whose favour she could wish to overcome her own



<P>shyness and reserve.&nbsp; The men appeared to her all coarse,



<P>the women all pert, everybody underbred; and she gave



<P>as little contentment as she received from introductions



<P>either to old or new acquaintance.&nbsp; The young ladies who



<P>approached her at first with some respect, in consideration



<P>of her coming from a baronet's family, were soon offended



<P>by what they termed "airs"; for, as she neither played



<P>on the pianoforte nor wore fine pelisses, they could,



<P>on farther observation, admit no right of superiority.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The first solid consolation which Fanny received for



<P>the evils of home, the first which her judgment could



<P>entirely approve, and which gave any promise of durability,



<P>was in a better knowledge of Susan, and a hope of being



<P>of service to her.&nbsp; Susan had always behaved pleasantly



<P>to herself, but the determined character of her general



<P>manners had astonished and alarmed her, and it was at least



<P>a fortnight before she began to understand a disposition



<P>so totally different from her own.&nbsp; Susan saw that much



<P>was wrong at home, and wanted to set it right.&nbsp; That a girl



<P>of fourteen, acting only on her own unassisted reason,



<P>should err in the method of reform, was not wonderful;



<P>and Fanny soon became more disposed to admire the natural



<P>light of the mind which could so early distinguish justly,



<P>than to censure severely the faults of conduct to which it led.



<P>Susan was only acting on the same truths, and pursuing



<P>the same system, which her own judgment acknowledged,



<P>but which her more supine and yielding temper would



<P>have shrunk from asserting.&nbsp; Susan tried to be useful,



<P>where _she_ could only have gone away and cried; and that



<P>Susan was useful she could perceive; that things, bad as



<P>they were, would have been worse but for such interposition,



<P>and that both her mother and Betsey were restrained from



<P>some excesses of very offensive indulgence and vulgarity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In every argument with her mother, Susan had in point



<P>of reason the advantage, and never was there any maternal



<P>tenderness to buy her off.&nbsp; The blind fondness which was



<P>for ever producing evil around her she had never known.



<P>There was no gratitude for affection past or present



<P>to make her better bear with its excesses to the others.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All this became gradually evident, and gradually placed



<P>Susan before her sister as an object of mingled compassion



<P>and respect.&nbsp; That her manner was wrong, however, at times



<P>very wrong, her measures often ill-chosen and ill-timed,



<P>and her looks and language very often indefensible,



<P>Fanny could not cease to feel; but she began to hope they



<P>might be rectified.&nbsp; Susan, she found, looked up to her



<P>and wished for her good opinion; and new as anything like an



<P>office of authority was to Fanny, new as it was to imagine



<P>herself capable of guiding or informing any one, she did



<P>resolve to give occasional hints to Susan, and endeavour



<P>to exercise for her advantage the juster notions of what was



<P>due to everybody, and what would be wisest for herself,



<P>which her own more favoured education had fixed in her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her influence, or at least the consciousness and use of it,



<P>originated in an act of kindness by Susan, which, after many



<P>hesitations of delicacy, she at last worked herself up to.



<P>It had very early occurred to her that a small sum



<P>of money might, perhaps, restore peace for ever on the



<P>sore subject of the silver knife, canvassed as it now



<P>was continually, and the riches which she was in possession



<P>of herself, her uncle having given her 10 at parting,



<P>made her as able as she was willing to be generous.



<P>But she was so wholly unused to confer favours,



<P>except on the very poor, so unpractised in removing evils,



<P>or bestowing kindnesses among her equals, and so fearful



<P>of appearing to elevate herself as a great lady at home,



<P>that it took some time to determine that it would not be



<P>unbecoming in her to make such a present.&nbsp; It was made,



<P>however, at last:&nbsp; a silver knife was bought for Betsey,



<P>and accepted with great delight, its newness giving it



<P>every advantage over the other that could be desired;



<P>Susan was established in the full possession of her own,



<P>Betsey handsomely declaring that now she had got one so much



<P>prettier herself, she should never want _that_ again; and no



<P>reproach seemed conveyed to the equally satisfied mother,



<P>which Fanny had almost feared to be impossible.&nbsp; The deed



<P>thoroughly answered:&nbsp; a source of domestic altercation



<P>was entirely done away, and it was the means of opening



<P>Susan's heart to her, and giving her something more to love



<P>and be interested in.&nbsp; Susan shewed that she had delicacy:



<P>pleased as she was to be mistress of property which she



<P>had been struggling for at least two years, she yet



<P>feared that her sister's judgment had been against her,



<P>and that a reproof was designed her for having so struggled



<P>as to make the purchase necessary for the tranquillity of



<P>the house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her temper was open.&nbsp; She acknowledged her fears,



<P>blamed herself for having contended so warmly;



<P>and from that hour Fanny, understanding the worth of her



<P>disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined



<P>to seek her good opinion and refer to her judgment,



<P>began to feel again the blessing of affection, and to



<P>entertain the hope of being useful to a mind so much in



<P>need of help, and so much deserving it.&nbsp; She gave advice,



<P>advice too sound to be resisted by a good understanding,



<P>and given so mildly and considerately as not to irritate



<P>an imperfect temper, and she had the happiness of observing



<P>its good effects not unfrequently.&nbsp; More was not expected



<P>by one who, while seeing all the obligation and expediency



<P>of submission and forbearance, saw also with sympathetic



<P>acuteness of feeling all that must be hourly grating



<P>to a girl like Susan.&nbsp; Her greatest wonder on the subject



<P>soon became--not that Susan should have been provoked into



<P>disrespect and impatience against her better knowledge--



<P>but that so much better knowledge, so many good notions



<P>should have been hers at all; and that, brought up in the



<P>midst of negligence and error, she should have formed



<P>such proper opinions of what ought to be; she, who had



<P>had no cousin Edmund to direct her thoughts or fix her principles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The intimacy thus begun between them was a material



<P>advantage to each.&nbsp; By sitting together upstairs,



<P>they avoided a great deal of the disturbance of the house;



<P>Fanny had peace, and Susan learned to think it no



<P>misfortune to be quietly employed.&nbsp; They sat without



<P>a fire; but that was a privation familiar even to Fanny,



<P>and she suffered the less because reminded by it of



<P>the East room.&nbsp; It was the only point of resemblance.



<P>In space, light, furniture, and prospect, there was nothing



<P>alike in the two apartments; and she often heaved a sigh



<P>at the remembrance of all her books and boxes, and various



<P>comforts there.&nbsp; By degrees the girls came to spend the



<P>chief of the morning upstairs, at first only in working



<P>and talking, but after a few days, the remembrance of the



<P>said books grew so potent and stimulative that Fanny found



<P>it impossible not to try for books again.&nbsp; There were none



<P>in her father's house; but wealth is luxurious and daring,



<P>and some of hers found its way to a circulating library.



<P>She became a subscriber; amazed at being anything _in_



<P>_propria_ _persona_, amazed at her own doings in every way,



<P>to be a renter, a chuser of books!&nbsp; And to be having any



<P>one's improvement in view in her choice!&nbsp; But so it was.



<P>Susan had read nothing, and Fanny longed to give her



<P>a share in her own first pleasures, and inspire a taste



<P>for the biography and poetry which she delighted in herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In this occupation she hoped, moreover, to bury some



<P>of the recollections of Mansfield, which were too apt



<P>to seize her mind if her fingers only were busy;



<P>and, especially at this time, hoped it might be useful



<P>in diverting her thoughts from pursuing Edmund to London,



<P>whither, on the authority of her aunt's last letter,



<P>she knew he was gone.&nbsp; She had no doubt of what would ensue.



<P>The promised notification was hanging over her head.



<P>The postman's knock within the neighbourhood was beginning



<P>to bring its daily terrors, and if reading could banish



<P>the idea for even half an hour, it was something gained.

<B>CHAPTER XLI</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>A week was gone since Edmund might be supposed



<P>in town, and Fanny had heard nothing of him.



<P>There were three different conclusions to be drawn from



<P>his silence, between which her mind was in fluctuation;



<P>each of them at times being held the most probable.



<P>Either his going had been again delayed, or he had yet



<P>procured no opportunity of seeing Miss Crawford alone,



<P>or he was too happy for letter-writing!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One morning, about this time, Fanny having now been nearly



<P>four weeks from Mansfield, a point which she never failed



<P>to think over and calculate every day, as she and Susan



<P>were preparing to remove, as usual, upstairs, they were



<P>stopped by the knock of a visitor, whom they felt they could



<P>not avoid, from Rebecca's alertness in going to the door,



<P>a duty which always interested her beyond any other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a gentleman's voice; it was a voice that Fanny



<P>was just turning pale about, when Mr. Crawford walked



<P>into the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Good sense, like hers, will always act when really



<P>called upon; and she found that she had been able to name



<P>him to her mother, and recall her remembrance of the name,



<P>as that of "William's friend," though she could not



<P>previously have believed herself capable of uttering a



<P>syllable at such a moment.&nbsp; The consciousness of his being



<P>known there only as William's friend was some support.



<P>Having introduced him, however, and being all reseated,



<P>the terrors that occurred of what this visit might lead



<P>to were overpowering, and she fancied herself on the point



<P>of fainting away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While trying to keep herself alive, their visitor, who had



<P>at first approached her with as animated a countenance



<P>as ever, was wisely and kindly keeping his eyes away,



<P>and giving her time to recover, while he devoted himself



<P>entirely to her mother, addressing her, and attending to



<P>her with the utmost politeness and propriety, at the same



<P>time with a degree of friendliness, of interest at least,



<P>which was making his manner perfect.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Price's manners were also at their best.&nbsp; Warmed by



<P>the sight of such a friend to her son, and regulated



<P>by the wish of appearing to advantage before him, she was



<P>overflowing with gratitude--artless, maternal gratitude--



<P>which could not be unpleasing.&nbsp; Mr. Price was out,



<P>which she regretted very much.&nbsp; Fanny was just recovered



<P>enough to feel that _she_ could not regret it; for to her



<P>many other sources of uneasiness was added the severe



<P>one of shame for the home in which he found her.



<P>She might scold herself for the weakness, but there was



<P>no scolding it away.&nbsp; She was ashamed, and she would have



<P>been yet more ashamed of her father than of all the rest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They talked of William, a subject on which Mrs. Price



<P>could never tire; and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his



<P>commendation as even her heart could wish.&nbsp; She felt



<P>that she had never seen so agreeable a man in her life;



<P>and was only astonished to find that, so great and so



<P>agreeable as he was, he should be come down to Portsmouth



<P>neither on a visit to the port-admiral, nor the commissioner,



<P>nor yet with the intention of going over to the island,



<P>nor of seeing the dockyard.&nbsp; Nothing of all that she



<P>had been used to think of as the proof of importance,



<P>or the employment of wealth, had brought him to Portsmouth.



<P>He had reached it late the night before, was come for a



<P>day or two, was staying at the Crown, had accidentally



<P>met with a navy officer or two of his acquaintance since



<P>his arrival, but had no object of that kind in coming.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By the time he had given all this information, it was not



<P>unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at



<P>and spoken to; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye,



<P>and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister



<P>the evening before his leaving London; that she had sent



<P>her best and kindest love, but had had no time for writing;



<P>that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half



<P>an hour, having spent scarcely twenty-four hours in London,



<P>after his return from Norfolk, before he set off again;



<P>that her cousin Edmund was in town, had been in town,



<P>he understood, a few days; that he had not seen him himself,



<P>but that he was well, had left them all well at Mansfield,



<P>and was to dine, as yesterday, with the Frasers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny listened collectedly, even to the last-mentioned



<P>circumstance; nay, it seemed a relief to her worn



<P>mind to be at any certainty; and the words, "then by



<P>this time it is all settled," passed internally,



<P>without more evidence of emotion than a faint blush

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After talking a little more about Mansfield, a subject



<P>in which her interest was most apparent, Crawford began



<P>to hint at the expediency of an early walk.&nbsp; "It was a



<P>lovely morning, and at that season of the year a fine morning



<P>so often turned off, that it was wisest for everybody not



<P>to delay their exercise"; and such hints producing nothing,



<P>he soon proceeded to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price



<P>and her daughters to take their walk without loss of time.



<P>Now they came to an understanding.&nbsp; Mrs. Price, it appeared,



<P>scarcely ever stirred out of doors, except of a Sunday;



<P>she owned she could seldom, with her large family,



<P>find time for a walk.&nbsp; "Would she not, then, persuade her



<P>daughters to take advantage of such weather, and allow



<P>him the pleasure of attending them?"&nbsp; Mrs. Price was



<P>greatly obliged and very complying.&nbsp; "Her daughters



<P>were very much confined; Portsmouth was a sad place;



<P>they did not often get out; and she knew they had some



<P>errands in the town, which they would be very glad to do."



<P>And the consequence was, that Fanny, strange as it was--



<P>strange, awkward, and distressing--found herself and Susan,



<P>within ten minutes, walking towards the High Street



<P>with Mr. Crawford.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was soon pain upon pain, confusion upon confusion;



<P>for they were hardly in the High Street before they met



<P>her father, whose appearance was not the better from its



<P>being Saturday.&nbsp; He stopt; and, ungentlemanlike as he looked,



<P>Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr. Crawford.



<P>She could not have a doubt of the manner in which



<P>Mr. Crawford must be struck.&nbsp; He must be ashamed



<P>and disgusted altogether.&nbsp; He must soon give her up,



<P>and cease to have the smallest inclination for the match;



<P>and yet, though she had been so much wanting his affection



<P>to be cured, this was a sort of cure that would be almost



<P>as bad as the complaint; and I believe there is scarcely



<P>a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather



<P>put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever,



<P>agreeable man, than have him driven away by the vulgarity



<P>of her nearest relations.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his future



<P>father-in-law with any idea of taking him for a model



<P>in dress; but (as Fanny instantly, and to her great



<P>relief, discerned) her father was a very different man,



<P>a very different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most



<P>highly respected stranger, from what he was in his own



<P>family at home.&nbsp; His manners now, though not polished,



<P>were more than passable:&nbsp; they were grateful, animated, manly;



<P>his expressions were those of an attached father,



<P>and a sensible man; his loud tones did very well in the



<P>open air, and there was not a single oath to be heard.



<P>Such was his instinctive compliment to the good manners



<P>of Mr. Crawford; and, be the consequence what it might,



<P>Fanny's immediate feelings were infinitely soothed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The conclusion of the two gentlemen's civilities was an offer



<P>of Mr. Price's to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard,



<P>which Mr. Crawford, desirous of accepting as a favour



<P>what was intended as such, though he had seen the dockyard



<P>again and again, and hoping to be so much the longer



<P>with Fanny, was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of,



<P>if the Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue;



<P>and as it was somehow or other ascertained, or inferred,



<P>or at least acted upon, that they were not at all afraid,



<P>to the dockyard they were all to go; and but for



<P>Mr. Crawford, Mr. Price would have turned thither directly,



<P>without the smallest consideration for his daughters'



<P>errands in the High Street.&nbsp; He took care, however, that they



<P>should be allowed to go to the shops they came out expressly



<P>to visit; and it did not delay them long, for Fanny could



<P>so little bear to excite impatience, or be waited for,



<P>that before the gentlemen, as they stood at the door,



<P>could do more than begin upon the last naval regulations,



<P>or settle the number of three-deckers now in commission,



<P>their companions were ready to proceed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were then to set forward for the dockyard at once,



<P>and the walk would have been conducted--according to



<P>Mr. Crawford's opinion--in a singular manner,



<P>had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of it,



<P>as the two girls, he found, would have been left



<P>to follow, and keep up with them or not, as they could,



<P>while they walked on together at their own hasty pace.



<P>He was able to introduce some improvement occasionally,



<P>though by no means to the extent he wished; he absolutely



<P>would not walk away from them; and at any crossing



<P>or any crowd, when Mr. Price was only calling out,



<P>"Come, girls; come, Fan; come, Sue, take care of yourselves;



<P>keep a sharp lookout!" he would give them his particular



<P>attendance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Once fairly in the dockyard, he began to reckon upon



<P>some happy intercourse with Fanny, as they were very soon



<P>joined by a brother lounger of Mr. Price's, who was come



<P>to take his daily survey of how things went on, and who



<P>must prove a far more worthy companion than himself;



<P>and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied



<P>going about together, and discussing matters of equal



<P>and never-failing interest, while the young people sat down



<P>upon some timbers in the yard, or found a seat on board



<P>a vessel in the stocks which they all went to look at.



<P>Fanny was most conveniently in want of rest.&nbsp; Crawford could



<P>not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down;



<P>but he could have wished her sister away.&nbsp; A quick-looking



<P>girl of Susan's age was the very worst third in the world:



<P>totally different from Lady Bertram, all eyes and ears;



<P>and there was no introducing the main point before her.



<P>He must content himself with being only generally agreeable,



<P>and letting Susan have her share of entertainment,



<P>with the indulgence, now and then, of a look or hint



<P>for the better-informed and conscious Fanny.&nbsp; Norfolk was



<P>what he had mostly to talk of:&nbsp; there he had been some time,



<P>and everything there was rising in importance from his



<P>present schemes.&nbsp; Such a man could come from no place,



<P>no society, without importing something to amuse;



<P>his journeys and his acquaintance were all of use,



<P>and Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her.



<P>For Fanny, somewhat more was related than the accidental



<P>agreeableness of the parties he had been in.



<P>For her approbation, the particular reason of his going into



<P>Norfolk at all, at this unusual time of year, was given.



<P>It had been real business, relative to the renewal of a



<P>lease in which the welfare of a large and--he believed--



<P>industrious family was at stake.&nbsp; He had suspected his



<P>agent of some underhand dealing; of meaning to bias him



<P>against the deserving; and he had determined to go himself,



<P>and thoroughly investigate the merits of the case.



<P>He had gone, had done even more good than he had foreseen,



<P>had been useful to more than his first plan had comprehended,



<P>and was now able to congratulate himself upon it, and to



<P>feel that in performing a duty, he had secured agreeable



<P>recollections for his own mind.&nbsp; He had introduced himself



<P>to some tenants whom he had never seen before; he had begun



<P>making acquaintance with cottages whose very existence,



<P>though on his own estate, had been hitherto unknown to him.



<P>This was aimed, and well aimed, at Fanny.&nbsp; It was pleasing



<P>to hear him speak so properly; here he had been acting



<P>as he ought to do.&nbsp; To be the friend of the poor and



<P>the oppressed!&nbsp; Nothing could be more grateful to her;



<P>and she was on the point of giving him an approving look,



<P>when it was all frightened off by his adding a something



<P>too pointed of his hoping soon to have an assistant,



<P>a friend, a guide in every plan of utility or charity



<P>for Everingham:&nbsp; a somebody that would make Everingham



<P>and all about it a dearer object than it had ever been



<P>yet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She turned away, and wished he would not say such things.



<P>She was willing to allow he might have more good



<P>qualities than she had been wont to suppose.&nbsp; She began



<P>to feel the possibility of his turning out well at last;



<P>but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her,



<P>and ought not to think of her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He perceived that enough had been said of Everingham,



<P>and that it would be as well to talk of something else,



<P>and turned to Mansfield.&nbsp; He could not have chosen better;



<P>that was a topic to bring back her attention and her looks



<P>almost instantly.&nbsp; It was a real indulgence to her to hear



<P>or to speak of Mansfield.&nbsp; Now so long divided from



<P>everybody who knew the place, she felt it quite the voice



<P>of a friend when he mentioned it, and led the way to her



<P>fond exclamations in praise of its beauties and comforts,



<P>and by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed



<P>her to gratify her own heart in the warmest eulogium,



<P>in speaking of her uncle as all that was clever and good,



<P>and her aunt as having the sweetest of all sweet tempers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had a great attachment to Mansfield himself; he said so;



<P>he looked forward with the hope of spending much, very much,



<P>of his time there; always there, or in the neighbourhood.



<P>He particularly built upon a very happy summer and



<P>autumn there this year; he felt that it would be so:



<P>he depended upon it; a summer and autumn infinitely superior



<P>to the last.&nbsp; As animated, as diversified, as social,



<P>but with circumstances of superiority undescribable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mansfield, Sotherton, Thornton Lacey," he continued;



<P>"what a society will be comprised in those houses!



<P>And at Michaelmas, perhaps, a fourth may be added:



<P>some small hunting-box in the vicinity of everything so dear;



<P>for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey, as Edmund



<P>Bertram once good-humouredly proposed, I hope I foresee



<P>two objections:&nbsp; two fair, excellent, irresistible objections



<P>to that plan."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was doubly silenced here; though when the moment



<P>was passed, could regret that she had not forced herself into



<P>the acknowledged comprehension of one half of his meaning,



<P>and encouraged him to say something more of his sister



<P>and Edmund.&nbsp; It was a subject which she must learn to speak of,



<P>and the weakness that shrunk from it would soon be quite



<P>unpardonable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Mr. Price and his friend had seen all that they wished,



<P>or had time for, the others were ready to return;



<P>and in the course of their walk back, Mr. Crawford contrived



<P>a minute's privacy for telling Fanny that his only



<P>business in Portsmouth was to see her; that he was come



<P>down for a couple of days on her account, and hers only,



<P>and because he could not endure a longer total separation.



<P>She was sorry, really sorry; and yet in spite of this and the



<P>two or three other things which she wished he had not said,



<P>she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him;



<P>he was much more gentle, obliging, and attentive to other



<P>people's feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield;



<P>she had never seen him so agreeable--so _near_ being agreeable;



<P>his behaviour to her father could not offend, and there



<P>was something particularly kind and proper in the notice



<P>he took of Susan.&nbsp; He was decidedly improved.&nbsp; She wished



<P>the next day over, she wished he had come only for one day;



<P>but it was not so very bad as she would have expected:



<P>the pleasure of talking of Mansfield was so very great!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before they parted, she had to thank him for another pleasure,



<P>and one of no trivial kind.&nbsp; Her father asked him to do



<P>them the honour of taking his mutton with them, and Fanny



<P>had time for only one thrill of horror, before he declared



<P>himself prevented by a prior engagement.&nbsp; He was engaged



<P>to dinner already both for that day and the next; he had met



<P>with some acquaintance at the Crown who would not be denied;



<P>he should have the honour, however, of waiting on them



<P>again on the morrow, etc., and so they parted--Fanny in



<P>a state of actual felicity from escaping so horrible an evil!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To have had him join their family dinner-party, and see



<P>all their deficiencies, would have been dreadful!



<P>Rebecca's cookery and Rebecca's waiting, and Betsey's



<P>eating at table without restraint, and pulling everything



<P>about as she chose, were what Fanny herself was not yet



<P>enough inured to for her often to make a tolerable meal.



<P>_She_ was nice only from natural delicacy, but _he_ had been



<P>brought up in a school of luxury and epicurism.

<B>CHAPTER XLIII</B>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>It was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back,



<P>to London, on the morrow, for nothing more was seen



<P>of him at Mr. Price's; and two days afterwards, it was



<P>a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following letter from



<P>his sister, opened and read by her, on another account,



<P>with the most anxious curiosity:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have to inform you, my dearest Fanny, that Henry



<P>has been down to Portsmouth to see you; that he had a



<P>delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday,



<P>and one still more to be dwelt on the next day,



<P>on the ramparts; when the balmy air, the sparkling sea,



<P>and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether



<P>in the most delicious harmony, and afforded sensations



<P>which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect.&nbsp; This, as well



<P>as I understand, is to be the substance of my information.



<P>He makes me write, but I do not know what else is to



<P>be communicated, except this said visit to Portsmouth,



<P>and these two said walks, and his introduction to



<P>your family, especially to a fair sister of yours, a fine



<P>girl of fifteen, who was of the party on the ramparts,



<P>taking her first lesson, I presume, in love.&nbsp; I have



<P>not time for writing much, but it would be out of place



<P>if I had, for this is to be a mere letter of business,



<P>penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information,



<P>which could not be delayed without risk of evil.&nbsp; My dear,



<P>dear Fanny, if I had you here, how I would talk to you!



<P>You should listen to me till you were tired, and advise



<P>me till you were still tired more; but it is impossible



<P>to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper,



<P>so I will abstain altogether, and leave you to guess what



<P>you like.&nbsp; I have no news for you.&nbsp; You have politics,



<P>of course; and it would be too bad to plague you with



<P>the names of people and parties that fill up my time.



<P>I ought to have sent you an account of your cousin's



<P>first party, but I was lazy, and now it is too long ago;



<P>suffice it, that everything was just as it ought to be,



<P>in a style that any of her connexions must have been



<P>gratified to witness, and that her own dress and manners did



<P>her the greatest credit.&nbsp; My friend, Mrs. Fraser, is mad



<P>for such a house, and it would not make _me_ miserable.



<P>I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter; she seems in high spirits,



<P>and very happy.&nbsp; I fancy Lord S. is very good-humoured



<P>and pleasant in his own family, and I do not think him so



<P>very ill-looking as I did--at least, one sees many worse.



<P>He will not do by the side of your cousin Edmund.



<P>Of the last-mentioned hero, what shall I say?&nbsp; If I



<P>avoided his name entirely, it would look suspicious.



<P>I will say, then, that we have seen him two or three times,



<P>and that my friends here are very much struck with his



<P>gentlemanlike appearance.&nbsp; Mrs. Fraser (no bad judge)



<P>declares she knows but three men in town who have so good



<P>a person, height, and air; and I must confess, when he dined



<P>here the other day, there were none to compare with him,



<P>and we were a party of sixteen.&nbsp; Luckily there is no



<P>distinction of dress nowadays to tell tales, but--but--



<P>but Yours affectionately."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I had almost forgot (it was Edmund's fault:&nbsp; he gets into



<P>my head more than does me good) one very material thing I



<P>had to say from Henry and myself--I mean about our taking



<P>you back into Northamptonshire.&nbsp; My dear little creature,



<P>do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks.



<P>Those vile sea-breezes are the ruin of beauty and health.



<P>My poor aunt always felt affected if within ten miles



<P>of the sea, which the Admiral of course never believed,



<P>but I know it was so.&nbsp; I am at your service and Henry's,



<P>at an hour's notice.&nbsp; I should like the scheme, and we would



<P>make a little circuit, and shew you Everingham in our way,



<P>and perhaps you would not mind passing through London,



<P>and seeing the inside of St. George's, Hanover Square.



<P>Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such a time:



<P>I should not like to be tempted.&nbsp; What a long letter!



<P>one word more.&nbsp; Henry, I find, has some idea of going



<P>into Norfolk again upon some business that _you_ approve;



<P>but this cannot possibly be permitted before the middle



<P>of next week; that is, he cannot anyhow be spared till



<P>after the l4th, for _we_ have a party that evening.



<P>The value of a man like Henry, on such an occasion,



<P>is what you can have no conception of; so you must take it



<P>upon my word to be inestimable.&nbsp; He will see the Rushworths,



<P>which own I am not sorry for--having a little curiosity,



<P>and so I think has he--though he will not acknowledge



<P>it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was a letter to be run through eagerly, to be



<P>read deliberately, to supply matter for much reflection,



<P>and to leave everything in greater suspense than ever.



<P>The only certainty to be drawn from it was, that nothing



<P>decisive had yet taken place.&nbsp; Edmund had not yet spoken.



<P>How Miss Crawford really felt, how she meant to act,



<P>or might act without or against her meaning; whether his



<P>importance to her were quite what it had been before



<P>the last separation; whether, if lessened, it were likely



<P>to lessen more, or to recover itself, were subjects



<P>for endless conjecture, and to be thought of on that day



<P>and many days to come, without producing any conclusion.



<P>The idea that returned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford,



<P>after proving herself cooled and staggered by a return



<P>to London habits, would yet prove herself in the end



<P>too much attached to him to give him up.&nbsp; She would



<P>try to be more ambitious than her heart would allow.



<P>She would hesitate, she would tease, she would condition,



<P>she would require a great deal, but she would finally



<P>accept.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was Fanny's most frequent expectation.&nbsp; A house



<P>in town--that, she thought, must be impossible.



<P>Yet there was no saying what Miss Crawford might not ask.



<P>The prospect for her cousin grew worse and worse.



<P>The woman who could speak of him, and speak only of



<P>his appearance!&nbsp; What an unworthy attachment!&nbsp; To be



<P>deriving support from the commendations of Mrs. Fraser!



<P>_She_ who had known him intimately half a year!



<P>Fanny was ashamed of her.&nbsp; Those parts of the letter which



<P>related only to Mr. Crawford and herself, touched her,



<P>in comparison, slightly.&nbsp; Whether Mr. Crawford went



<P>into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly



<P>no concern of hers, though, everything considered,



<P>she thought he _would_ go without delay.&nbsp; That Miss



<P>Crawford should endeavour to secure a meeting between him



<P>and Mrs. Rushworth, was all in her worst line of conduct,



<P>and grossly unkind and ill-judged; but she hoped _he_



<P>would not be actuated by any such degrading curiosity.



<P>He acknowledged no such inducement, and his sister



<P>ought to have given him credit for better feelings than



<P>her own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was yet more impatient for another letter from



<P>town after receiving this than she had been before;



<P>and for a few days was so unsettled by it altogether,



<P>by what had come, and what might come, that her usual



<P>readings and conversation with Susan were much suspended.



<P>She could not command her attention as she wished.



<P>If Mr. Crawford remembered her message to her cousin,



<P>she thought it very likely, most likely, that he would write



<P>to her at all events; it would be most consistent with his



<P>usual kindness; and till she got rid of this idea, till it



<P>gradually wore off, by no letters appearing in the course



<P>of three or four days more, she was in a most restless,



<P>anxious state

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At length, a something like composure succeeded.



<P>Suspense must be submitted to, and must not be allowed



<P>to wear her out, and make her useless.&nbsp; Time did something,



<P>her own exertions something more, and she resumed her



<P>attentions to Susan, and again awakened the same interest



<P>in them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Susan was growing very fond of her, and though without



<P>any of the early delight in books which had been



<P>so strong in Fanny, with a disposition much less



<P>inclined to sedentary pursuits, or to information for



<P>information's sake, she had so strong a desire of not



<P>_appearing_ ignorant, as, with a good clear understanding,



<P>made her a most attentive, profitable, thankful pupil.



<P>Fanny was her oracle.&nbsp; Fanny's explanations and remarks



<P>were a most important addition to every essay, or every



<P>chapter of history.&nbsp; What Fanny told her of former times



<P>dwelt more on her mind than the pages of Goldsmith; and she



<P>paid her sister the compliment of preferring her style



<P>to that of any printed author.&nbsp; The early habit of reading was



<P>wanting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their conversations, however, were not always on subjects



<P>so high as history or morals.&nbsp; Others had their hour;



<P>and of lesser matters, none returned so often,



<P>or remained so long between them, as Mansfield Park,



<P>a description of the people, the manners, the amusements,



<P>the ways of Mansfield Park.&nbsp; Susan, who had an innate taste



<P>for the genteel and well-appointed, was eager to hear,



<P>and Fanny could not but indulge herself in dwelling on



<P>so beloved a theme.&nbsp; She hoped it was not wrong; though,



<P>after a time, Susan's very great admiration of everything



<P>said or done in her uncle's house, and earnest longing



<P>to go into Northamptonshire, seemed almost to blame



<P>her for exciting feelings which could not be gratified.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home



<P>than her elder sister; and as Fanny grew thoroughly



<P>to understand this, she began to feel that when her



<P>own release from Portsmouth came, her happiness would



<P>have a material drawback in leaving Susan behind.



<P>That a girl so capable of being made everything good should



<P>be left in such hands, distressed her more and more.



<P>Were _she_ likely to have a home to invite her to,



<P>what a blessing it would be!&nbsp; And had it been possible



<P>for her to return Mr. Crawford's regard, the probability



<P>of his being very far from objecting to such a measure would



<P>have been the greatest increase of all her own comforts.



<P>She thought he was really good-tempered, and could fancy



<P>his entering into a plan of that sort most pleasantly.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The Prices were just setting off for church the next day



<P>when Mr. Crawford appeared again.&nbsp; He came, not to stop,



<P>but to join them; he was asked to go with them to the



<P>Garrison chapel, which was exactly what he had intended,



<P>and they all walked thither together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The family were now seen to advantage.&nbsp; Nature had given



<P>them no inconsiderable share of beauty, and every Sunday



<P>dressed them in their cleanest skins and best attire.



<P>Sunday always brought this comfort to Fanny, and on this



<P>Sunday she felt it more than ever.&nbsp; Her poor mother now



<P>did not look so very unworthy of being Lady Bertram's



<P>sister as she was but too apt to look.&nbsp; It often grieved



<P>her to the heart to think of the contrast between them;



<P>to think that where nature had made so little difference,



<P>circumstances should have made so much, and that her mother,



<P>as handsome as Lady Bertram, and some years her junior,



<P>should have an appearance so much more worn and faded,



<P>so comfortless, so slatternly, so shabby.&nbsp; But Sunday



<P>made her a very creditable and tolerably cheerful-looking



<P>Mrs. Price, coming abroad with a fine family of children,



<P>feeling a little respite of her weekly cares, and only



<P>discomposed if she saw her boys run into danger, or Rebecca



<P>pass by with a flower in her hat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In chapel they were obliged to divide, but Mr. Crawford



<P>took care not to be divided from the female branch;



<P>and after chapel he still continued with them, and made



<P>one in the family party on the ramparts.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Price took her weekly walk on the ramparts every



<P>fine Sunday throughout the year, always going directly



<P>after morning service and staying till dinner-time. It



<P>was her public place:&nbsp; there she met her acquaintance,



<P>heard a little news, talked over the badness of the



<P>Portsmouth servants, and wound up her spirits for the six



<P>days ensuing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thither they now went; Mr. Crawford most happy to consider



<P>the Miss Prices as his peculiar charge; and before they



<P>had been there long, somehow or other, there was no



<P>saying how, Fanny could not have believed it, but he



<P>was walking between them with an arm of each under his,



<P>and she did not know how to prevent or put an end to it.



<P>It made her uncomfortable for a time, but yet there



<P>were enjoyments in the day and in the view which would



<P>be felt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The day was uncommonly lovely.&nbsp; It was really March;



<P>but it was April in its mild air, brisk soft wind,



<P>and bright sun, occasionally clouded for a minute;



<P>and everything looked so beautiful under the influence



<P>of such a sky, the effects of the shadows pursuing each



<P>other on the ships at Spithead and the island beyond,



<P>with the ever-varying hues of the sea, now at high water,



<P>dancing in its glee and dashing against the ramparts with



<P>so fine a sound, produced altogether such a combination



<P>of charms for Fanny, as made her gradually almost careless



<P>of the circumstances under which she felt them.&nbsp; Nay, had she



<P>been without his arm, she would soon have known that she



<P>needed it, for she wanted strength for a two hours'



<P>saunter of this kind, coming, as it generally did,



<P>upon a week's previous inactivity.&nbsp; Fanny was beginning



<P>to feel the effect of being debarred from her usual



<P>regular exercise; she had lost ground as to health



<P>since her being in Portsmouth; and but for Mr. Crawford



<P>and the beauty of the weather would soon have been knocked



<P>up now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The loveliness of the day, and of the view, he felt



<P>like herself.&nbsp; They often stopt with the same sentiment



<P>and taste, leaning against the wall, some minutes,



<P>to look and admire; and considering he was not Edmund,



<P>Fanny could not but allow that he was sufficiently open



<P>to the charms of nature, and very well able to express



<P>his admiration.&nbsp; She had a few tender reveries now and then,



<P>which he could sometimes take advantage of to look in her



<P>face without detection; and the result of these looks was,



<P>that though as bewitching as ever, her face was less



<P>blooming than it ought to be.&nbsp; She _said_ she was



<P>very well, and did not like to be supposed otherwise;



<P>but take it all in all, he was convinced that her present



<P>residence could not be comfortable, and therefore could



<P>not be salutary for her, and he was growing anxious for



<P>her being again at Mansfield, where her own happiness,



<P>and his in seeing her, must be so much greater.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have been here a month, I think?" said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No; not quite a month.&nbsp; It is only four weeks to-morrow



<P>since I left Mansfield."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are a most accurate and honest reckoner.&nbsp; I should



<P>call that a month."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I did not arrive here till Tuesday evening."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And it is to be a two months' visit, is not?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes.&nbsp; My uncle talked of two months.&nbsp; I suppose it



<P>will not be less."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And how are you to be conveyed back again?&nbsp; Who comes



<P>for you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know.&nbsp; I have heard nothing about it yet



<P>from my aunt.&nbsp; Perhaps I may be to stay longer.



<P>It may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly



<P>at the two months' end."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a moment's reflection, Mr. Crawford replied,



<P>"I know Mansfield, I know its way, I know its faults



<P>towards _you_.&nbsp; I know the danger of your being so



<P>far forgotten, as to have your comforts give way to the



<P>imaginary convenience of any single being in the family.



<P>I am aware that you may be left here week after week,



<P>if Sir Thomas cannot settle everything for coming himself,



<P>or sending your aunt's maid for you, without involving



<P>the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he



<P>may have laid down for the next quarter of a year.



<P>This will not do.&nbsp; Two months is an ample allowance;



<P>I should think six weeks quite enough.&nbsp; I am considering



<P>your sister's health," said he, addressing himself to Susan,



<P>"which I think the confinement of Portsmouth unfavourable to.



<P>She requires constant air and exercise.&nbsp; When you know her



<P>as well as I do, I am sure you will agree that she does,



<P>and that she ought never to be long banished from the free air



<P>and liberty of the country.&nbsp; If, therefore" (turning again



<P>to Fanny), "you find yourself growing unwell, and any



<P>difficulties arise about your returning to Mansfield,



<P>without waiting for the two months to be ended,



<P>_that_ must not be regarded as of any consequence,



<P>if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable



<P>than usual, and will only let my sister know it, give her



<P>only the slightest hint, she and I will immediately



<P>come down, and take you back to Mansfield.&nbsp; You know



<P>the ease and the pleasure with which this would be done.



<P>You know all that would be felt on the occasion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny thanked him, but tried to laugh it off.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am perfectly serious," he replied, "as you perfectly know.



<P>And I hope you will not be cruelly concealing any



<P>tendency to indisposition.&nbsp; Indeed, you shall _not_;



<P>it shall not be in your power; for so long only as you



<P>positively say, in every letter to Mary, 'I am well,'



<P>and I know you cannot speak or write a falsehood, so long



<P>only shall you be considered as well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny thanked him again, but was affected and distressed



<P>to a degree that made it impossible for her to say much,



<P>or even to be certain of what she ought to say.



<P>This was towards the close of their walk.&nbsp; He attended



<P>them to the last, and left them only at the door of their



<P>own house, when he knew them to be going to dinner,



<P>and therefore pretended to be waited for elsewhere.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish you were not so tired," said he, still detaining



<P>Fanny after all the others were in the house--"I wish I



<P>left you in stronger health.&nbsp; Is there anything I can



<P>do for you in town?&nbsp; I have half an idea of going into



<P>Norfolk again soon.&nbsp; I am not satisfied about Maddison.



<P>I am sure he still means to impose on me if possible,



<P>and get a cousin of his own into a certain mill, which I



<P>design for somebody else.&nbsp; I must come to an understanding



<P>with him.&nbsp; I must make him know that I will not be



<P>tricked on the south side of Everingham, any more than on



<P>the north:&nbsp; that I will be master of my own property.



<P>I was not explicit enough with him before.&nbsp; The mischief



<P>such a man does on an estate, both as to the credit of his



<P>employer and the welfare of the poor, is inconceivable.



<P>I have a great mind to go back into Norfolk directly,



<P>and put everything at once on such a footing as cannot



<P>be afterwards swerved from.&nbsp; Maddison is a clever fellow;



<P>I do not wish to displace him, provided he does not try



<P>to displace _me_; but it would be simple to be duped



<P>by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me,



<P>and worse than simple to let him give me a hard-hearted,



<P>griping fellow for a tenant, instead of an honest man,



<P>to whom I have given half a promise already.&nbsp; Would it not



<P>be worse than simple?&nbsp; Shall I go?&nbsp; Do you advise it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I advise!&nbsp; You know very well what is right."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes.&nbsp; When you give me your opinion, I always know



<P>what is right.&nbsp; Your judgment is my rule of right."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, no! do not say so.&nbsp; We have all a better guide



<P>in ourselves, if we would attend to it, than any other person



<P>can be.&nbsp; Good-bye; I wish you a pleasant journey to-morrow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is there nothing I can do for you in town?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing; I am much obliged to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you no message for anybody?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My love to your sister, if you please; and when you see



<P>my cousin, my cousin Edmund, I wish you would be so good



<P>as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly; and if he is lazy or negligent, I will write



<P>his excuses myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He could say no more, for Fanny would be no longer detained.



<P>He pressed her hand, looked at her, and was gone.



<P>_He_ went to while away the next three hours as he could,



<P>with his other acquaintance, till the best dinner that



<P>a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment,



<P>and _she_ turned in to her more simple one immediately.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their general fare bore a very different character;



<P>and could he have suspected how many privations, besides that



<P>of exercise, she endured in her father's house, he would



<P>have wondered that her looks were not much more affected



<P>than he found them.&nbsp; She was so little equal to Rebecca's



<P>puddings and Rebecca's hashes, brought to table, as they



<P>all were, with such accompaniments of half-cleaned plates,



<P>and not half-cleaned knives and forks, that she was very



<P>often constrained to defer her heartiest meal till she could



<P>send her brothers in the evening for biscuits and buns.



<P>After being nursed up at Mansfield, it was too late in the



<P>day to be hardened at Portsmouth; and though Sir Thomas,



<P>had he known all, might have thought his niece in the



<P>most promising way of being starved, both mind and body,



<P>into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford's good company



<P>and good fortune, he would probably have feared to push



<P>his experiment farther, lest she might die under the cure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day.



<P>Though tolerably secure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again,



<P>she could not help being low.&nbsp; It was parting with somebody



<P>of the nature of a friend; and though, in one light,



<P>glad to have him gone, it seemed as if she was now



<P>deserted by everybody; it was a sort of renewed separation



<P>from Mansfield; and she could not think of his returning



<P>to town, and being frequently with Mary and Edmund,



<P>without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate



<P>herself for having them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her dejection had no abatement from anything passing



<P>around her; a friend or two of her father's, as always



<P>happened if he was not with them, spent the long,



<P>long evening there; and from six o'clock till half-past nine,



<P>there was little intermission of noise or grog.&nbsp; She was



<P>very low.&nbsp; The wonderful improvement which she still



<P>fancied in Mr. Crawford was the nearest to administering



<P>comfort of anything within the current of her thoughts.



<P>Not considering in how different a circle she had been



<P>just seeing him, nor how much might be owing to contrast,



<P>she was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly



<P>more gentle and regardful of others than formerly.



<P>And, if in little things, must it not be so in great?



<P>So anxious for her health and comfort, so very feeling



<P>as he now expressed himself, and really seemed, might not



<P>it be fairly supposed that he would not much longer



<P>persevere in a suit so distressing to her?

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>As Fanny could not doubt that her answer was conveying



<P>a real disappointment, she was rather in expectation,



<P>from her knowledge of Miss Crawford's temper, of being



<P>urged again; and though no second letter arrived for the



<P>space of a week, she had still the same feeling when it



<P>did come.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On receiving it, she could instantly decide on its



<P>containing little writing, and was persuaded of its



<P>having the air of a letter of haste and business.



<P>Its object was unquestionable; and two moments were



<P>enough to start the probability of its being merely



<P>to give her notice that they should be in Portsmouth



<P>that very day, and to throw her into all the agitation



<P>of doubting what she ought to do in such a case.



<P>If two moments, however, can surround with difficulties,



<P>a third can disperse them; and before she had opened



<P>the letter, the possibility of Mr. and Miss Crawford's



<P>having applied to her uncle and obtained his permission



<P>was giving her ease.&nbsp; This was the letter--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A most scandalous, ill-natured rumour has just reached me,



<P>and I write, dear Fanny, to warn you against giving the



<P>least credit to it, should it spread into the country.



<P>Depend upon it, there is some mistake, and that a day or two



<P>will clear it up; at any rate, that Henry is blameless,



<P>and in spite of a moment's _etourderie_, thinks of



<P>nobody but you.&nbsp; Say not a word of it; hear nothing,



<P>surmise nothing, whisper nothing till I write again.



<P>I am sure it will be all hushed up, and nothing proved



<P>but Rushworth's folly.&nbsp; If they are gone, I would lay



<P>my life they are only gone to Mansfield Park, and Julia



<P>with them.&nbsp; But why would not you let us come for you?



<P>I wish you may not repent it.--Yours, etc."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny stood aghast.&nbsp; As no scandalous, ill-natured rumour



<P>had reached her, it was impossible for her to understand



<P>much of this strange letter.&nbsp; She could only perceive



<P>that it must relate to Wimpole Street and Mr. Crawford,



<P>and only conjecture that something very imprudent had just



<P>occurred in that quarter to draw the notice of the world,



<P>and to excite her jealousy, in Miss Crawford's apprehension,



<P>if she heard it.&nbsp; Miss Crawford need not be alarmed



<P>for her.&nbsp; She was only sorry for the parties concerned



<P>and for Mansfield, if the report should spread so far;



<P>but she hoped it might not.&nbsp; If the Rushworths were gone



<P>themselves to Mansfield, as was to be inferred from



<P>what Miss Crawford said, it was not likely that anything



<P>unpleasant should have preceded them, or at least should



<P>make any impression.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As to Mr. Crawford, she hoped it might give him a knowledge



<P>of his own disposition, convince him that he was not capable



<P>of being steadily attached to any one woman in the world,



<P>and shame him from persisting any longer in addressing herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was very strange!&nbsp; She had begun to think he really



<P>loved her, and to fancy his affection for her something



<P>more than common; and his sister still said that he cared



<P>for nobody else.&nbsp; Yet there must have been some marked



<P>display of attentions to her cousin, there must have



<P>been some strong indiscretion, since her correspondent



<P>was not of a sort to regard a slight one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Very uncomfortable she was, and must continue, till she



<P>heard from Miss Crawford again.&nbsp; It was impossible to



<P>banish the letter from her thoughts, and she could not



<P>relieve herself by speaking of it to any human being.



<P>Miss Crawford need not have urged secrecy with so much warmth;



<P>she might have trusted to her sense of what was due



<P>to her cousin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The next day came and brought no second letter.



<P>Fanny was disappointed.&nbsp; She could still think of little



<P>else all the morning; but, when her father came back



<P>in the afternoon with the daily newspaper as usual,



<P>she was so far from expecting any elucidation through such



<P>a channel that the subject was for a moment out of her head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was deep in other musing.&nbsp; The remembrance of her first



<P>evening in that room, of her father and his newspaper,



<P>came across her.&nbsp; No candle was now wanted.



<P>The sun was yet an hour and half above the horizon.



<P>She felt that she had, indeed, been three months there;



<P>and the sun's rays falling strongly into the parlour,



<P>instead of cheering, made her still more melancholy,



<P>for sunshine appeared to her a totally different thing



<P>in a town and in the country.&nbsp; Here, its power was only



<P>a glare:&nbsp; a stifling, sickly glare, serving but to bring



<P>forward stains and dirt that might otherwise have slept.



<P>There was neither health nor gaiety in sunshine in a town.



<P>She sat in a blaze of oppressive heat, in a cloud of



<P>moving dust, and her eyes could only wander from the walls,



<P>marked by her father's head, to the table cut and notched



<P>by her brothers, where stood the tea-board never



<P>thoroughly cleaned, the cups and saucers wiped in streaks,



<P>the milk a mixture of motes floating in thin blue,



<P>and the bread and butter growing every minute more



<P>greasy than even Rebecca's hands had first produced it.



<P>Her father read his newspaper, and her mother lamented



<P>over the ragged carpet as usual, while the tea was



<P>in preparation, and wished Rebecca would mend it;



<P>and Fanny was first roused by his calling out to her,



<P>after humphing and considering over a particular paragraph:



<P>"What's the name of your great cousins in town, Fan?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A moment's recollection enabled her to say, "Rushworth, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And don't they live in Wimpole Street?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then, there's the devil to pay among them, that's all!



<P>There" (holding out the paper to her); "much good may such



<P>fine relations do you.&nbsp; I don't know what Sir Thomas may



<P>think of such matters; he may be too much of the courtier



<P>and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less.&nbsp; But, by G--



<P>! if she belonged to _me_, I'd give her the rope's end



<P>as long as I could stand over her.&nbsp; A little flogging for



<P>man and woman too would be the best way of preventing such things."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny read to herself that "it was with infinite concern



<P>the newspaper had to announce to the world a matrimonial



<P>_fracas_ in the family of Mr. R. of Wimpole Street;



<P>the beautiful Mrs. R., whose name had not long been



<P>enrolled in the lists of Hymen, and who had promised



<P>to become so brilliant a leader in the fashionable world,



<P>having quitted her husband's roof in company with the



<P>well-known and captivating Mr. C., the intimate friend



<P>and associate of Mr. R., and it was not known even



<P>to the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is a mistake, sir," said Fanny instantly; "it must be



<P>a mistake, it cannot be true; it must mean some other people."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She spoke from the instinctive wish of delaying shame;



<P>she spoke with a resolution which sprung from despair,



<P>for she spoke what she did not, could not believe herself.



<P>It had been the shock of conviction as she read.&nbsp; The truth



<P>rushed on her; and how she could have spoken at all, how she



<P>could even have breathed, was afterwards matter of wonder



<P>to herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Price cared too little about the report to make her



<P>much answer.&nbsp; "It might be all a lie," he acknowledged;



<P>"but so many fine ladies were going to the devil nowadays



<P>that way, that there was no answering for anybody."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed, I hope it is not true," said Mrs. Price plaintively;



<P>"it would be so very shocking!&nbsp; If I have spoken once



<P>to Rebecca about that carpet, I am sure I have spoke at



<P>least a dozen times; have not I, Betsey?&nbsp; And it would



<P>not be ten minutes' work."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The horror of a mind like Fanny's, as it received the



<P>conviction of such guilt, and began to take in some part



<P>of the misery that must ensue, can hardly be described.



<P>At first, it was a sort of stupefaction; but every moment



<P>was quickening her perception of the horrible evil.



<P>She could not doubt, she dared not indulge a hope,



<P>of the paragraph being false.&nbsp; Miss Crawford's letter,



<P>which she had read so often as to make every line her own,



<P>was in frightful conformity with it.&nbsp; Her eager defence



<P>of her brother, her hope of its being _hushed_ _up_,



<P>her evident agitation, were all of a piece with something



<P>very bad; and if there was a woman of character in existence,



<P>who could treat as a trifle this sin of the first magnitude,



<P>who would try to gloss it over, and desire to have it



<P>unpunished, she could believe Miss Crawford to be the woman!



<P>Now she could see her own mistake as to _who_ were gone,



<P>or _said_ to be gone.&nbsp; It was not Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth;



<P>it was Mrs. Rushworth and Mr. Crawford.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny seemed to herself never to have been shocked before.



<P>There was no possibility of rest.&nbsp; The evening passed



<P>without a pause of misery, the night was totally sleepless.



<P>She passed only from feelings of sickness to shudderings



<P>of horror; and from hot fits of fever to cold.&nbsp; The event



<P>was so shocking, that there were moments even when her



<P>heart revolted from it as impossible:&nbsp; when she thought



<P>it could not be.&nbsp; A woman married only six months ago;



<P>a man professing himself devoted, even _engaged_ to another;



<P>that other her near relation; the whole family,



<P>both families connected as they were by tie upon tie;



<P>all friends, all intimate together!&nbsp; It was too horrible



<P>a confusion of guilt, too gross a complication of evil,



<P>for human nature, not in a state of utter barbarism,



<P>to be capable of! yet her judgment told her it was so.



<P>_His_ unsettled affections, wavering with his vanity,



<P>_Maria's_ decided attachment, and no sufficient principle



<P>on either side, gave it possibility:&nbsp; Miss Crawford's



<P>letter stampt it a fact.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>What would be the consequence?&nbsp; Whom would it not injure?



<P>Whose views might it not affect?&nbsp; Whose peace would it



<P>not cut up for ever?&nbsp; Miss Crawford, herself, Edmund;



<P>but it was dangerous, perhaps, to tread such ground.



<P>She confined herself, or tried to confine herself, to the simple,



<P>indubitable family misery which must envelop all, if it were



<P>indeed a matter of certified guilt and public exposure.



<P>The mother's sufferings, the father's; there she paused.



<P>Julia's, Tom's, Edmund's; there a yet longer pause.



<P>They were the two on whom it would fall most horribly.



<P>Sir Thomas's parental solicitude and high sense of honour



<P>and decorum, Edmund's upright principles, unsuspicious temper,



<P>and genuine strength of feeling, made her think it



<P>scarcely possible for them to support life and reason



<P>under such disgrace; and it appeared to her that, as far



<P>as this world alone was concerned, the greatest blessing



<P>to every one of kindred with Mrs. Rushworth would be



<P>instant annihilation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nothing happened the next day, or the next, to weaken



<P>her terrors.&nbsp; Two posts came in, and brought no refutation,



<P>public or private.&nbsp; There was no second letter to explain



<P>away the first from Miss Crawford; there was no intelligence



<P>from Mansfield, though it was now full time for her



<P>to hear again from her aunt.&nbsp; This was an evil omen.



<P>She had, indeed, scarcely the shadow of a hope to soothe



<P>her mind, and was reduced to so low and wan and trembling



<P>a condition, as no mother, not unkind, except Mrs. Price



<P>could have overlooked, when the third day did bring the



<P>sickening knock, and a letter was again put into her hands.



<P>It bore the London postmark, and came from Edmund.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear Fanny,--You know our present wretchedness.



<P>May God support you under your share!&nbsp; We have been here



<P>two days, but there is nothing to be done.&nbsp; They cannot



<P>be traced.&nbsp; You may not have heard of the last blow--



<P>Julia's elopement; she is gone to Scotland with Yates.



<P>She left London a few hours before we entered it.



<P>At any other time this would have been felt dreadfully.



<P>Now it seems nothing; yet it is an heavy aggravation.



<P>My father is not overpowered.&nbsp; More cannot be hoped.



<P>He is still able to think and act; and I write,



<P>by his desire, to propose your returning home.



<P>He is anxious to get you there for my mother's sake.



<P>I shall be at Portsmouth the morning after you receive this,



<P>and hope to find you ready to set off for Mansfield.



<P>My father wishes you to invite Susan to go with you for a



<P>few months.&nbsp; Settle it as you like; say what is proper;



<P>I am sure you will feel such an instance of his



<P>kindness at such a moment!&nbsp; Do justice to his meaning,



<P>however I may confuse it.&nbsp; You may imagine something



<P>of my present state.&nbsp; There is no end of the evil let



<P>loose upon us.&nbsp; You will see me early by the mail.--



<P>Yours, etc."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Never had Fanny more wanted a cordial.&nbsp; Never had she felt



<P>such a one as this letter contained.&nbsp; To-morrow! to leave



<P>Portsmouth to-morrow! She was, she felt she was, in the



<P>greatest danger of being exquisitely happy, while so many



<P>were miserable.&nbsp; The evil which brought such good to her!



<P>She dreaded lest she should learn to be insensible of it.



<P>To be going so soon, sent for so kindly, sent for as



<P>a comfort, and with leave to take Susan, was altogether



<P>such a combination of blessings as set her heart in



<P>a glow, and for a time seemed to distance every pain,



<P>and make her incapable of suitably sharing the distress



<P>even of those whose distress she thought of most.



<P>Julia's elopement could affect her comparatively but little;



<P>she was amazed and shocked; but it could not occupy her,



<P>could not dwell on her mind.&nbsp; She was obliged to call



<P>herself to think of it, and acknowledge it to be terrible



<P>and grievous, or it was escaping her, in the midst of all



<P>the agitating pressing joyful cares attending this summons



<P>to herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There is nothing like employment, active indispensable employment,



<P>for relieving sorrow.&nbsp; Employment, even melancholy,



<P>may dispel melancholy, and her occupations were hopeful.



<P>She had so much to do, that not even the horrible



<P>story of Mrs. Rushworth--now fixed to the last point



<P>of certainty could affect her as it had done before.



<P>She had not time to be miserable.&nbsp; Within twenty-four



<P>hours she was hoping to be gone; her father and mother



<P>must be spoken to, Susan prepared, everything got ready.



<P>Business followed business; the day was hardly long enough.



<P>The happiness she was imparting, too, happiness very little



<P>alloyed by the black communication which must briefly



<P>precede it--the joyful consent of her father and mother



<P>to Susan's going with her--the general satisfaction with



<P>which the going of both seemed regarded, and the ecstasy



<P>of Susan herself, was all serving to support her spirits.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The affliction of the Bertrams was little felt in the family.



<P>Mrs. Price talked of her poor sister for a few minutes,



<P>but how to find anything to hold Susan's clothes,



<P>because Rebecca took away all the boxes and spoilt them,



<P>was much more in her thoughts:&nbsp; and as for Susan,



<P>now unexpectedly gratified in the first wish of her heart,



<P>and knowing nothing personally of those who had sinned,



<P>or of those who were sorrowing--if she could help rejoicing



<P>from beginning to end, it was as much as ought to be expected



<P>from human virtue at fourteen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As nothing was really left for the decision of Mrs. Price,



<P>or the good offices of Rebecca, everything was rationally



<P>and duly accomplished, and the girls were ready for



<P>the morrow.&nbsp; The advantage of much sleep to prepare



<P>them for their journey was impossible.&nbsp; The cousin



<P>who was travelling towards them could hardly have less



<P>than visited their agitated spirits--one all happiness,



<P>the other all varying and indescribable perturbation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By eight in the morning Edmund was in the house.&nbsp; The girls



<P>heard his entrance from above, and Fanny went down.



<P>The idea of immediately seeing him, with the knowledge



<P>of what he must be suffering, brought back all her own



<P>first feelings.&nbsp; He so near her, and in misery.&nbsp; She was



<P>ready to sink as she entered the parlour.&nbsp; He was alone,



<P>and met her instantly; and she found herself pressed



<P>to his heart with only these words, just articulate,



<P>"My Fanny, my only sister; my only comfort now!"



<P>She could say nothing; nor for some minutes could he



<P>say more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He turned away to recover himself, and when he spoke again,



<P>though his voice still faltered, his manner shewed



<P>the wish of self-command, and the resolution of avoiding



<P>any farther allusion.&nbsp; "Have you breakfasted?&nbsp; When shall



<P>you be ready?&nbsp; Does Susan go?" were questions following



<P>each other rapidly.&nbsp; His great object was to be off



<P>as soon as possible.&nbsp; When Mansfield was considered,



<P>time was precious; and the state of his own mind made



<P>him find relief only in motion.&nbsp; It was settled that he



<P>should order the carriage to the door in half an hour.



<P>Fanny answered for their having breakfasted and being quite



<P>ready in half an hour.&nbsp; He had already ate, and declined



<P>staying for their meal.&nbsp; He would walk round the ramparts,



<P>and join them with the carriage.&nbsp; He was gone again;



<P>glad to get away even from Fanny.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked very ill; evidently suffering under



<P>violent emotions, which he was determined to suppress.



<P>She knew it must be so, but it was terrible to her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The carriage came; and he entered the house again at



<P>the same moment, just in time to spend a few minutes with



<P>the family, and be a witness--but that he saw nothing--



<P>of the tranquil manner in which the daughters were



<P>parted with, and just in time to prevent their sitting



<P>down to the breakfast-table, which, by dint of much



<P>unusual activity, was quite and completely ready as



<P>the carriage drove from the door.&nbsp; Fanny's last meal



<P>in her father's house was in character with her first:



<P>she was dismissed from it as hospitably as she had been welcomed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How her heart swelled with joy and gratitude as she



<P>passed the barriers of Portsmouth, and how Susan's face



<P>wore its broadest smiles, may be easily conceived.



<P>Sitting forwards, however, and screened by her bonnet,



<P>those smiles were unseen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The journey was likely to be a silent one.&nbsp; Edmund's deep



<P>sighs often reached Fanny.&nbsp; Had he been alone with her,



<P>his heart must have opened in spite of every resolution;



<P>but Susan's presence drove him quite into himself, and his



<P>attempts to talk on indifferent subjects could never be



<P>long supported.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny watched him with never-failing solicitude,



<P>and sometimes catching his eye, revived an affectionate smile,



<P>which comforted her; but the first day's journey passed



<P>without her hearing a word from him on the subjects



<P>that were weighing him down.&nbsp; The next morning produced



<P>a little more.&nbsp; Just before their setting out from Oxford,



<P>while Susan was stationed at a window, in eager observation



<P>of the departure of a large family from the inn,



<P>the other two were standing by the fire; and Edmund,



<P>particularly struck by the alteration in Fanny's looks,



<P>and from his ignorance of the daily evils of her



<P>father's house, attributing an undue share of the change,



<P>attributing _all_ to the recent event, took her hand,



<P>and said in a low, but very expressive tone, "No wonder--



<P>you must feel it--you must suffer.&nbsp; How a man who had



<P>once loved, could desert you!&nbsp; But _yours_--your regard



<P>was new compared with----Fanny, think of _me_!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The first division of their journey occupied a long day,



<P>and brought them, almost knocked up, to Oxford;



<P>but the second was over at a much earlier hour.



<P>They were in the environs of Mansfield long before



<P>the usual dinner-time, and as they approached the



<P>beloved place, the hearts of both sisters sank a little.



<P>Fanny began to dread the meeting with her aunts and Tom,



<P>under so dreadful a humiliation; and Susan to feel with



<P>some anxiety, that all her best manners, all her lately



<P>acquired knowledge of what was practised here, was on



<P>the point of being called into action.&nbsp; Visions of good



<P>and ill breeding, of old vulgarisms and new gentilities,



<P>were before her; and she was meditating much upon



<P>silver forks, napkins, and finger-glasses. Fanny had



<P>been everywhere awake to the difference of the country



<P>since February; but when they entered the Park her



<P>perceptions and her pleasures were of the keenest sort.



<P>It was three months, full three months, since her



<P>quitting it, and the change was from winter to summer.



<P>Her eye fell everywhere on lawns and plantations of the



<P>freshest green; and the trees, though not fully clothed,



<P>were in that delightful state when farther beauty is known



<P>to be at hand, and when, while much is actually given



<P>to the sight, more yet remains for the imagination.



<P>Her enjoyment, however, was for herself alone.&nbsp; Edmund could



<P>not share it.&nbsp; She looked at him, but he was leaning back,



<P>sunk in a deeper gloom than ever, and with eyes closed,



<P>as if the view of cheerfulness oppressed him, and the



<P>lovely scenes of home must be shut out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It made her melancholy again; and the knowledge of what must



<P>be enduring there, invested even the house, modern, airy,



<P>and well situated as it was, with a melancholy aspect.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By one of the suffering party within they were expected



<P>with such impatience as she had never known before.



<P>Fanny had scarcely passed the solemn-looking servants,



<P>when Lady Bertram came from the drawing-room to meet her;



<P>came with no indolent step; and falling on her neck, said,



<P>"Dear Fanny! now I shall be comfortable.

<B>CHAPTER XLVII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>It had been a miserable party, each of the three believing



<P>themselves most miserable.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris, however, as most



<P>attached to Maria, was really the greatest sufferer.



<P>Maria was her first favourite, the dearest of all;



<P>the match had been her own contriving, as she had been



<P>wont with such pride of heart to feel and say, and this



<P>conclusion of it almost overpowered her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was an altered creature, quieted, stupefied, indifferent to



<P>everything that passed.&nbsp; The being left with her sister



<P>and nephew, and all the house under her care, had been



<P>an advantage entirely thrown away; she had been unable



<P>to direct or dictate, or even fancy herself useful.



<P>When really touched by affliction, her active powers



<P>had been all benumbed; and neither Lady Bertram nor Tom



<P>had received from her the smallest support or attempt



<P>at support.&nbsp; She had done no more for them than they



<P>had done for each other.&nbsp; They had been all solitary,



<P>helpless, and forlorn alike; and now the arrival of the



<P>others only established her superiority in wretchedness.



<P>Her companions were relieved, but there was no good



<P>for _her_.&nbsp; Edmund was almost as welcome to his brother



<P>as Fanny to her aunt; but Mrs. Norris, instead of having



<P>comfort from either, was but the more irritated by the



<P>sight of the person whom, in the blindness of her anger,



<P>she could have charged as the daemon of the piece.



<P>Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not have happened.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Susan too was a grievance.&nbsp; She had not spirits to notice



<P>her in more than a few repulsive looks, but she felt



<P>her as a spy, and an intruder, and an indigent niece,



<P>and everything most odious.&nbsp; By her other aunt, Susan was



<P>received with quiet kindness.&nbsp; Lady Bertram could not



<P>give her much time, or many words, but she felt her,



<P>as Fanny's sister, to have a claim at Mansfield,



<P>and was ready to kiss and like her; and Susan was more



<P>than satisfied, for she came perfectly aware that nothing



<P>but ill-humour was to be expected from aunt Norris;



<P>and was so provided with happiness, so strong in that



<P>best of blessings, an escape from many certain evils,



<P>that she could have stood against a great deal more



<P>indifference than she met with from the others.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was now left a good deal to herself, to get acquainted



<P>with the house and grounds as she could, and spent her



<P>days very happily in so doing, while those who might



<P>otherwise have attended to her were shut up, or wholly



<P>occupied each with the person quite dependent on them,



<P>at this time, for everything like comfort; Edmund trying



<P>to bury his own feelings in exertions for the relief



<P>of his brother's, and Fanny devoted to her aunt Bertram,



<P>returning to every former office with more than former zeal,



<P>and thinking she could never do enough for one who seemed



<P>so much to want her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To talk over the dreadful business with Fanny, talk and lament,



<P>was all Lady Bertram's consolation.&nbsp; To be listened to and



<P>borne with, and hear the voice of kindness and sympathy



<P>in return, was everything that could be done for her.



<P>To be otherwise comforted was out of the question.



<P>The case admitted of no comfort.&nbsp; Lady Bertram did not



<P>think deeply, but, guided by Sir Thomas, she thought



<P>justly on all important points; and she saw, therefore,



<P>in all its enormity, what had happened, and neither



<P>endeavoured herself, nor required Fanny to advise her,



<P>to think little of guilt and infamy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her affections were not acute, nor was her mind tenacious.



<P>After a time, Fanny found it not impossible to direct



<P>her thoughts to other subjects, and revive some interest



<P>in the usual occupations; but whenever Lady Bertram _was_



<P>fixed on the event, she could see it only in one light,



<P>as comprehending the loss of a daughter, and a disgrace



<P>never to be wiped off.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny learnt from her all the particulars which had



<P>yet transpired.&nbsp; Her aunt was no very methodical narrator,



<P>but with the help of some letters to and from Sir Thomas,



<P>and what she already knew herself, and could reasonably



<P>combine, she was soon able to understand quite as much



<P>as she wished of the circumstances attending the story.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Rushworth had gone, for the Easter holidays,



<P>to Twickenham, with a family whom she had just grown



<P>intimate with:&nbsp; a family of lively, agreeable manners,



<P>and probably of morals and discretion to suit, for to _their_



<P>house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times.



<P>His having been in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew.



<P>Mr. Rushworth had been gone at this time to Bath, to pass



<P>a few days with his mother, and bring her back to town,



<P>and Maria was with these friends without any restraint,



<P>without even Julia; for Julia had removed from Wimpole Street



<P>two or three weeks before, on a visit to some relations



<P>of Sir Thomas; a removal which her father and mother were



<P>now disposed to attribute to some view of convenience



<P>on Mr. Yates's account.&nbsp; Very soon after the Rushworths'



<P>return to Wimpole Street, Sir Thomas had received a



<P>letter from an old and most particular friend in London,



<P>who hearing and witnessing a good deal to alarm him



<P>in that quarter, wrote to recommend Sir Thomas's coming



<P>to London himself, and using his influence with his



<P>daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was already



<P>exposing her to unpleasant remarks, and evidently making



<P>Mr. Rushworth uneasy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter, without



<P>communicating its contents to any creature at Mansfield,



<P>when it was followed by another, sent express from the



<P>same friend, to break to him the almost desperate situation



<P>in which affairs then stood with the young people.



<P>Mrs. Rushworth had left her husband's house:&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth



<P>had been in great anger and distress to _him_ (Mr. Harding)



<P>for his advice; Mr. Harding feared there had been _at_



<P>_least_ very flagrant indiscretion.&nbsp; The maidservant



<P>of Mrs. Rushworth, senior, threatened alarmingly.&nbsp; He was



<P>doing all in his power to quiet everything, with the hope



<P>of Mrs. Rushworth's return, but was so much counteracted



<P>in Wimpole Street by the influence of Mr. Rushworth's mother,



<P>that the worst consequences might be apprehended.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This dreadful communication could not be kept from the rest



<P>of the family.&nbsp; Sir Thomas set off, Edmund would go with him,



<P>and the others had been left in a state of wretchedness,



<P>inferior only to what followed the receipt of the next



<P>letters from London.&nbsp; Everything was by that time public



<P>beyond a hope.&nbsp; The servant of Mrs. Rushworth, the mother,



<P>had exposure in her power, and supported by her mistress,



<P>was not to be silenced.&nbsp; The two ladies, even in the short



<P>time they had been together, had disagreed; and the bitterness



<P>of the elder against her daughter-in-law might perhaps arise



<P>almost as much from the personal disrespect with which



<P>she had herself been treated as from sensibility for her son.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>However that might be, she was unmanageable.&nbsp; But had she



<P>been less obstinate, or of less weight with her son,



<P>who was always guided by the last speaker, by the person



<P>who could get hold of and shut him up, the case would



<P>still have been hopeless, for Mrs. Rushworth did not



<P>appear again, and there was every reason to conclude



<P>her to be concealed somewhere with Mr. Crawford,



<P>who had quitted his uncle's house, as for a journey,



<P>on the very day of her absenting herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas, however, remained yet a little longer in town,



<P>in the hope of discovering and snatching her from farther vice,



<P>though all was lost on the side of character.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>_His_ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of.



<P>There was but one of his children who was not at this time



<P>a source of misery to him.&nbsp; Tom's complaints had been



<P>greatly heightened by the shock of his sister's conduct,



<P>and his recovery so much thrown back by it, that even



<P>Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference, and all



<P>her alarms were regularly sent off to her husband;



<P>and Julia's elopement, the additional blow which had met



<P>him on his arrival in London, though its force had been



<P>deadened at the moment, must, she knew, be sorely felt.



<P>She saw that it was.&nbsp; His letters expressed how much he



<P>deplored it.&nbsp; Under any circumstances it would have been



<P>an unwelcome alliance; but to have it so clandestinely



<P>formed, and such a period chosen for its completion,



<P>placed Julia's feelings in a most unfavourable light,



<P>and severely aggravated the folly of her choice.



<P>He called it a bad thing, done in the worst manner,



<P>and at the worst time; and though Julia was yet as more



<P>pardonable than Maria as folly than vice, he could not



<P>but regard the step she had taken as opening the worst



<P>probabilities of a conclusion hereafter like her sister's.



<P>Such was his opinion of the set into which she had



<P>thrown herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny felt for him most acutely.&nbsp; He could have no comfort



<P>but in Edmund.&nbsp; Every other child must be racking his heart.



<P>His displeasure against herself she trusted, reasoning



<P>differently from Mrs. Norris, would now be done away.



<P>_She_ should be justified.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford would have



<P>fully acquitted her conduct in refusing him; but this,



<P>though most material to herself, would be poor consolation



<P>to Sir Thomas.&nbsp; Her uncle's displeasure was terrible to her;



<P>but what could her justification or her gratitude and



<P>attachment do for him?&nbsp; His stay must be on Edmund alone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was mistaken, however, in supposing that Edmund gave



<P>his father no present pain.&nbsp; It was of a much less poignant



<P>nature than what the others excited; but Sir Thomas



<P>was considering his happiness as very deeply involved



<P>in the offence of his sister and friend; cut off by it,



<P>as he must be, from the woman whom he had been pursuing



<P>with undoubted attachment and strong probability of success;



<P>and who, in everything but this despicable brother,



<P>would have been so eligible a connexion.&nbsp; He was aware



<P>of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf,



<P>in addition to all the rest, when they were in town:



<P>he had seen or conjectured his feelings; and, having reason



<P>to think that one interview with Miss Crawford had taken place,



<P>from which Edmund derived only increased distress, had been



<P>as anxious on that account as on others to get him out of town,



<P>and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt,



<P>with a view to his relief and benefit, no less than theirs.



<P>Fanny was not in the secret of her uncle's feelings,



<P>Sir Thomas not in the secret of Miss Crawford's character.



<P>Had he been privy to her conversation with his son, he would



<P>not have wished her to belong to him, though her twenty



<P>thousand pounds had been forty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did



<P>not admit of a doubt with Fanny; and yet, till she knew



<P>that he felt the same, her own conviction was insufficient.



<P>She thought he did, but she wanted to be assured of it.



<P>If he would now speak to her with the unreserve which



<P>had sometimes been too much for her before, it would



<P>be most consoling; but _that_ she found was not to be.



<P>She seldom saw him:&nbsp; never alone.&nbsp; He probably avoided



<P>being alone with her.&nbsp; What was to be inferred?&nbsp; That his



<P>judgment submitted to all his own peculiar and bitter share



<P>of this family affliction, but that it was too keenly



<P>felt to be a subject of the slightest communication.



<P>This must be his state.&nbsp; He yielded, but it was with



<P>agonies which did not admit of speech.&nbsp; Long, long would



<P>it be ere Miss Crawford's name passed his lips again,



<P>or she could hope for a renewal of such confidential



<P>intercourse as had been.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It _was_ long.&nbsp; They reached Mansfield on Thursday,



<P>and it was not till Sunday evening that Edmund began



<P>to talk to her on the subject.&nbsp; Sitting with her on



<P>Sunday evening--a wet Sunday evening--the very time of



<P>all others when, if a friend is at hand, the heart must



<P>be opened, and everything told; no one else in the room,



<P>except his mother, who, after hearing an affecting sermon,



<P>had cried herself to sleep, it was impossible not to speak;



<P>and so, with the usual beginnings, hardly to be traced



<P>as to what came first, and the usual declaration that



<P>if she would listen to him for a few minutes, he should



<P>be very brief, and certainly never tax her kindness



<P>in the same way again; she need not fear a repetition;



<P>it would be a subject prohibited entirely:&nbsp; he entered



<P>upon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations



<P>of the first interest to himself, to one of whose



<P>affectionate sympathy he was quite convinced

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How Fanny listened, with what curiosity and concern,



<P>what pain and what delight, how the agitation of his



<P>voice was watched, and how carefully her own eyes were



<P>fixed on any object but himself, may be imagined.



<P>The opening was alarming.&nbsp; He had seen Miss Crawford.



<P>He had been invited to see her.&nbsp; He had received a note



<P>from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call; and regarding



<P>it as what was meant to be the last, last interview



<P>of friendship, and investing her with all the feelings



<P>of shame and wretchedness which Crawford's sister ought



<P>to have known, he had gone to her in such a state of mind,



<P>so softened, so devoted, as made it for a few moments



<P>impossible to Fanny's fears that it should be the last.



<P>But as he proceeded in his story, these fears were over.



<P>She had met him, he said, with a serious--certainly a serious--



<P>even an agitated air; but before he had been able



<P>to speak one intelligible sentence, she had introduced



<P>the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him.



<P>"'I heard you were in town,' said she; 'I wanted to see you.



<P>Let us talk over this sad business.&nbsp; What can equal the folly



<P>of our two relations?'&nbsp; I could not answer, but I believe



<P>my looks spoke.&nbsp; She felt reproved.&nbsp; Sometimes how quick



<P>to feel!&nbsp; With a graver look and voice she then added,



<P>'I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister's expense.'



<P>So she began, but how she went on, Fanny, is not fit,



<P>is hardly fit to be repeated to you.&nbsp; I cannot recall



<P>all her words.&nbsp; I would not dwell upon them if I could.



<P>Their substance was great anger at the _folly_ of each.



<P>She reprobated her brother's folly in being drawn on



<P>by a woman whom he had never cared for, to do what must



<P>lose him the woman he adored; but still more the folly of



<P>poor Maria, in sacrificing such a situation, plunging into



<P>such difficulties, under the idea of being really loved



<P>by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear.



<P>Guess what I must have felt.&nbsp; To hear the woman whom--



<P>no harsher name than folly given!&nbsp; So voluntarily,



<P>so freely, so coolly to canvass it!&nbsp; No reluctance,



<P>no horror, no feminine, shall I say, no modest loathings?



<P>This is what the world does.&nbsp; For where, Fanny, shall we



<P>find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed?&nbsp; Spoilt,



<P>spoilt!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a little reflection, he went on with a sort



<P>of desperate calmness.&nbsp; "I will tell you everything,



<P>and then have done for ever.&nbsp; She saw it only as folly,



<P>and that folly stamped only by exposure.&nbsp; The want of



<P>common discretion, of caution:&nbsp; his going down to Richmond



<P>for the whole time of her being at Twickenham; her putting



<P>herself in the power of a servant; it was the detection,



<P>in short--oh, Fanny! it was the detection, not the offence,



<P>which she reprobated.&nbsp; It was the imprudence which had



<P>brought things to extremity, and obliged her brother



<P>to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He stopt.&nbsp; "And what," said Fanny (believing herself



<P>required to speak), "what could you say?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing, nothing to be understood.&nbsp; I was like a man stunned.



<P>She went on, began to talk of you; yes, then she began



<P>to talk of you, regretting, as well she might, the loss



<P>of such a--.&nbsp; There she spoke very rationally.&nbsp; But she



<P>has always done justice to you.&nbsp; 'He has thrown away,'



<P>said she, 'such a woman as he will never see again.



<P>She would have fixed him; she would have made him happy



<P>for ever.'&nbsp; My dearest Fanny, I am giving you, I hope,



<P>more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might



<P>have been--but what never can be now.&nbsp; You do not wish me



<P>to be silent?&nbsp; If you do, give me but a look, a word, and I



<P>have done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No look or word was given.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank God," said he.&nbsp; "We were all disposed to wonder,



<P>but it seems to have been the merciful appointment



<P>of Providence that the heart which knew no guile



<P>should not suffer.&nbsp; She spoke of you with high praise



<P>and warm affection; yet, even here, there was alloy,



<P>a dash of evil; for in the midst of it she could exclaim,



<P>'Why would not she have him?&nbsp; It is all her fault.



<P>Simple girl!&nbsp; I shall never forgive her.&nbsp; Had she accepted



<P>him as she ought, they might now have been on the point



<P>of marriage, and Henry would have been too happy and too



<P>busy to want any other object.&nbsp; He would have taken



<P>no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth again.



<P>It would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation,



<P>in yearly meetings at Sotherton and Everingham.'&nbsp; Could you



<P>have believed it possible?&nbsp; But the charm is broken.



<P>My eyes are opened."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Cruel!" said Fanny, "quite cruel.&nbsp; At such a moment to



<P>give way to gaiety, to speak with lightness, and to you!



<P>Absolute cruelty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Cruelty, do you call it?&nbsp; We differ there.&nbsp; No, hers is



<P>not a cruel nature.&nbsp; I do not consider her as meaning



<P>to wound my feelings.&nbsp; The evil lies yet deeper:



<P>in her total ignorance, unsuspiciousness of there being



<P>such feelings; in a perversion of mind which made it



<P>natural to her to treat the subject as she did.&nbsp; She was



<P>speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak,



<P>as she imagined everybody else would speak.&nbsp; Hers are



<P>not faults of temper.&nbsp; She would not voluntarily give



<P>unnecessary pain to any one, and though I may deceive myself,



<P>I cannot but think that for me, for my feelings, she would--



<P>Hers are faults of principle, Fanny; of blunted delicacy



<P>and a corrupted, vitiated mind.&nbsp; Perhaps it is best for me,



<P>since it leaves me so little to regret.&nbsp; Not so, however.



<P>Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of



<P>losing her, rather than have to think of her as I do.



<P>I told her so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; when I left her I told her so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How long were you together?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Five-and-twenty minutes.&nbsp; Well, she went on to say that



<P>what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage



<P>between them.&nbsp; She spoke of it, Fanny, with a steadier



<P>voice than I can."&nbsp; He was obliged to pause more than once



<P>as he continued.&nbsp; "'We must persuade Henry to marry her,'



<P>said she; 'and what with honour, and the certainty of having



<P>shut himself out for ever from Fanny, I do not despair



<P>of it.&nbsp; Fanny he must give up.&nbsp; I do not think that even



<P>_he_ could now hope to succeed with one of her stamp,



<P>and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable difficulty.



<P>My influence, which is not small shall all go that way;



<P>and when once married, and properly supported by her



<P>own family, people of respectability as they are, she may



<P>recover her footing in society to a certain degree.



<P>In some circles, we know, she would never be admitted,



<P>but with good dinners, and large parties, there will



<P>always be those who will be glad of her acquaintance;



<P>and there is, undoubtedly, more liberality and candour



<P>on those points than formerly.&nbsp; What I advise is,



<P>that your father be quiet.&nbsp; Do not let him injure his own



<P>cause by interference.&nbsp; Persuade him to let things take



<P>their course.&nbsp; If by any officious exertions of his,



<P>she is induced to leave Henry's protection, there will be



<P>much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain



<P>with him.&nbsp; I know how he is likely to be influenced.



<P>Let Sir Thomas trust to his honour and compassion, and it



<P>may all end well; but if he get his daughter away, it will



<P>be destroying the chief hold.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After repeating this, Edmund was so much affected that Fanny,



<P>watching him with silent, but most tender concern,



<P>was almost sorry that the subject had been entered



<P>on at all.&nbsp; It was long before he could speak again.



<P>At last, "Now, Fanny," said he, "I shall soon have done.



<P>I have told you the substance of all that she said.



<P>As soon as I could speak, I replied that I had not



<P>supposed it possible, coming in such a state of mind



<P>into that house as I had done, that anything could



<P>occur to make me suffer more, but that she had been



<P>inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence.



<P>That though I had, in the course of our acquaintance,



<P>been often sensible of some difference in our opinions,



<P>on points, too, of some moment, it had not entered my



<P>imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she



<P>had now proved it.&nbsp; That the manner in which she treated



<P>the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister



<P>(with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say),



<P>but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself,



<P>giving it every reproach but the right; considering its ill



<P>consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne



<P>by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong; and last



<P>of all, and above all, recommending to us a compliance,



<P>a compromise, an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin,



<P>on the chance of a marriage which, thinking as I now thought



<P>of her brother, should rather be prevented than sought;



<P>all this together most grievously convinced me that I had



<P>never understood her before, and that, as far as related



<P>to mind, it had been the creature of my own imagination,



<P>not Miss Crawford, that I had been too apt to dwell on



<P>for many months past.&nbsp; That, perhaps, it was best for me;



<P>I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship, feelings,



<P>hopes which must, at any rate, have been torn from me now.



<P>And yet, that I must and would confess that, could I



<P>have restored her to what she had appeared to me before,



<P>I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain



<P>of parting, for the sake of carrying with me the right of



<P>tenderness and esteem.&nbsp; This is what I said, the purport



<P>of it; but, as you may imagine, not spoken so collectedly



<P>or methodically as I have repeated it to you.&nbsp; She was



<P>astonished, exceedingly astonished--more than astonished.



<P>I saw her change countenance.&nbsp; She turned extremely red.



<P>I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings:&nbsp; a great,



<P>though short struggle; half a wish of yielding to truths,



<P>half a sense of shame, but habit, habit carried it.



<P>She would have laughed if she could.&nbsp; It was a sort of laugh,



<P>as she answered, 'A pretty good lecture, upon my word.



<P>Was it part of your last sermon?&nbsp; At this rate you will



<P>soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey;



<P>and when I hear of you next, it may be as a celebrated preacher



<P>in some great society of Methodists, or as a missionary



<P>into foreign parts.'&nbsp; She tried to speak carelessly,



<P>but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear.



<P>I only said in reply, that from my heart I wished her well,



<P>and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think



<P>more justly, and not owe the most valuable knowledge we



<P>could any of us acquire, the knowledge of ourselves and of



<P>our duty, to the lessons of affliction, and immediately



<P>left the room.&nbsp; I had gone a few steps, Fanny, when I



<P>heard the door open behind me.&nbsp; 'Mr. Bertram,' said she.



<P>I looked back.&nbsp; 'Mr. Bertram,' said she, with a smile;



<P>but it was a smile ill-suited to the conversation that



<P>had passed, a saucy playful smile, seeming to invite



<P>in order to subdue me; at least it appeared so to me.



<P>I resisted; it was the impulse of the moment to resist,



<P>and still walked on.&nbsp; I have since, sometimes, for a moment,



<P>regretted that I did not go back, but I know I was right,



<P>and such has been the end of our acquaintance.&nbsp; And what



<P>an acquaintance has it been!&nbsp; How have I been deceived!



<P>Equally in brother and sister deceived!&nbsp; I thank you for



<P>your patience, Fanny.&nbsp; This has been the greatest relief,



<P>and now we will have done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And such was Fanny's dependence on his words, that for five



<P>minutes she thought they _had_ done.&nbsp; Then, however, it all



<P>came on again, or something very like it, and nothing



<P>less than Lady Bertram's rousing thoroughly up could



<P>really close such a conversation.&nbsp; Till that happened,



<P>they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone, and how she



<P>had attached him, and how delightful nature had made her,



<P>and how excellent she would have been, had she fallen into



<P>good hands earlier.&nbsp; Fanny, now at liberty to speak openly,



<P>felt more than justified in adding to his knowledge



<P>of her real character, by some hint of what share his



<P>brother's state of health might be supposed to have in



<P>her wish for a complete reconciliation.&nbsp; This was not an



<P>agreeable intimation.&nbsp; Nature resisted it for a while.



<P>It would have been a vast deal pleasanter to have had



<P>her more disinterested in her attachment; but his vanity



<P>was not of a strength to fight long against reason.



<P>He submitted to believe that Tom's illness had influenced her,



<P>only reserving for himself this consoling thought,



<P>that considering the many counteractions of opposing habits,



<P>she had certainly been _more_ attached to him than could



<P>have been expected, and for his sake been more near



<P>doing right.&nbsp; Fanny thought exactly the same; and they were



<P>also quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting effect,



<P>the indelible impression, which such a disappointment



<P>must make on his mind.&nbsp; Time would undoubtedly abate



<P>somewhat of his sufferings, but still it was a sort



<P>of thing which he never could get entirely the better of;



<P>and as to his ever meeting with any other woman who could--



<P>it was too impossible to be named but with indignation.



<P>Fanny's friendship was all that he had to cling to.

<B>CHAPTER XLV</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>At about the week's end from his return to Mansfield,



<P>Tom's immediate danger was over, and he was so far



<P>pronounced safe as to make his mother perfectly easy;



<P>for being now used to the sight of him in his suffering,



<P>helpless state, and hearing only the best, and never thinking



<P>beyond what she heard, with no disposition for alarm



<P>and no aptitude at a hint, Lady Bertram was the happiest



<P>subject in the world for a little medical imposition.



<P>The fever was subdued; the fever had been his complaint;



<P>of course he would soon be well again.&nbsp; Lady Bertram could



<P>think nothing less, and Fanny shared her aunt's security,



<P>till she received a few lines from Edmund, written purposely



<P>to give her a clearer idea of his brother's situation,



<P>and acquaint her with the apprehensions which he and his



<P>father had imbibed from the physician with respect to some



<P>strong hectic symptoms, which seemed to seize the frame



<P>on the departure of the fever.&nbsp; They judged it best



<P>that Lady Bertram should not be harassed by alarms which,



<P>it was to be hoped, would prove unfounded; but there was



<P>no reason why Fanny should not know the truth.&nbsp; They were



<P>apprehensive for his lungs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient



<P>and the sickroom in a juster and stronger light than



<P>all Lady Bertram's sheets of paper could do.&nbsp; There was



<P>hardly any one in the house who might not have described,



<P>from personal observation, better than herself;



<P>not one who was not more useful at times to her son.



<P>She could do nothing but glide in quietly and look at him;



<P>but when able to talk or be talked to, or read to,



<P>Edmund was the companion he preferred.&nbsp; His aunt worried



<P>him by her cares, and Sir Thomas knew not how to bring down



<P>his conversation or his voice to the level of irritation



<P>and feebleness.&nbsp; Edmund was all in all.&nbsp; Fanny would



<P>certainly believe him so at least, and must find that her



<P>estimation of him was higher than ever when he appeared



<P>as the attendant, supporter, cheerer of a suffering brother.



<P>There was not only the debility of recent illness to assist:



<P>there was also, as she now learnt, nerves much affected,



<P>spirits much depressed to calm and raise, and her own



<P>imagination added that there must be a mind to be



<P>properly guided.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The family were not consumptive, and she was more inclined



<P>to hope than fear for her cousin, except when she thought



<P>of Miss Crawford; but Miss Crawford gave her the idea



<P>of being the child of good luck, and to her selfishness



<P>and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only son.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Even in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was



<P>not forgotten.&nbsp; Edmund's letter had this postscript.



<P>"On the subject of my last, I had actually begun a letter



<P>when called away by Tom's illness, but I have now changed



<P>my mind, and fear to trust the influence of friends.



<P>When Tom is better, I shall go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such was the state of Mansfield, and so it continued,



<P>with scarcely any change, till Easter.&nbsp; A line occasionally



<P>added by Edmund to his mother's letter was enough for



<P>Fanny's information.&nbsp; Tom's amendment was alarmingly slow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Easter came particularly late this year, as Fanny had most



<P>sorrowfully considered, on first learning that she had



<P>no chance of leaving Portsmouth till after it.&nbsp; It came,



<P>and she had yet heard nothing of her return--nothing even



<P>of the going to London, which was to precede her return.



<P>Her aunt often expressed a wish for her, but there was



<P>no notice, no message from the uncle on whom all depended.



<P>She supposed he could not yet leave his son, but it was a cruel,



<P>a terrible delay to her.&nbsp; The end of April was coming on;



<P>it would soon be almost three months, instead of two,



<P>that she had been absent from them all, and that her days



<P>had been passing in a state of penance, which she loved



<P>them too well to hope they would thoroughly understand;



<P>and who could yet say when there might be leisure to think



<P>of or fetch her?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her eagerness, her impatience, her longings to be with them,



<P>were such as to bring a line or two of Cowper's Tirocinium



<P>for ever before her.&nbsp; "With what intense desire she wants



<P>her home," was continually on her tongue, as the truest



<P>description of a yearning which she could not suppose



<P>any schoolboy's bosom to feel more keenly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When she had been coming to Portsmouth, she had loved to call



<P>it her home, had been fond of saying that she was going home;



<P>the word had been very dear to her, and so it still was,



<P>but it must be applied to Mansfield.&nbsp; _That_ was now



<P>the home.&nbsp; Portsmouth was Portsmouth; Mansfield was home.



<P>They had been long so arranged in the indulgence of her



<P>secret meditations, and nothing was more consolatory



<P>to her than to find her aunt using the same language:



<P>"I cannot but say I much regret your being from home



<P>at this distressing time, so very trying to my spirits.



<P>I trust and hope, and sincerely wish you may never be absent



<P>from home so long again," were most delightful sentences



<P>to her.&nbsp; Still, however, it was her private regale.



<P>Delicacy to her parents made her careful not to betray



<P>such a preference of her uncle's house.&nbsp; It was always:



<P>"When I go back into Northamptonshire, or when I return



<P>to Mansfield, I shall do so and so."&nbsp; For a great



<P>while it was so, but at last the longing grew stronger,



<P>it overthrew caution, and she found herself talking of what



<P>she should do when she went home before she was aware.



<P>She reproached herself, coloured, and looked fearfully towards



<P>her father and mother.&nbsp; She need not have been uneasy.



<P>There was no sign of displeasure, or even of hearing her.



<P>They were perfectly free from any jealousy of Mansfield.



<P>She was as welcome to wish herself there as to be there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was sad to Fanny to lose all the pleasures of spring.



<P>She had not known before what pleasures she _had_ to lose



<P>in passing March and April in a town.&nbsp; She had not known



<P>before how much the beginnings and progress of vegetation



<P>had delighted her.&nbsp; What animation, both of body and mind,



<P>she had derived from watching the advance of that season



<P>which cannot, in spite of its capriciousness, be unlovely,



<P>and seeing its increasing beauties from the earliest



<P>flowers in the warmest divisions of her aunt's garden,



<P>to the opening of leaves of her uncle's plantations,



<P>and the glory of his woods.&nbsp; To be losing such pleasures



<P>was no trifle; to be losing them, because she was in



<P>the midst of closeness and noise, to have confinement,



<P>bad air, bad smells, substituted for liberty,



<P>freshness, fragrance, and verdure, was infinitely worse:



<P>but even these incitements to regret were feeble,



<P>compared with what arose from the conviction of being



<P>missed by her best friends, and the longing to be useful



<P>to those who were wanting her!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Could she have been at home, she might have been of service



<P>to every creature in the house.&nbsp; She felt that she must



<P>have been of use to all.&nbsp; To all she must have saved some



<P>trouble of head or hand; and were it only in supporting



<P>the spirits of her aunt Bertram, keeping her from the evil



<P>of solitude, or the still greater evil of a restless,



<P>officious companion, too apt to be heightening danger



<P>in order to enhance her own importance, her being there



<P>would have been a general good.&nbsp; She loved to fancy how she



<P>could have read to her aunt, how she could have talked



<P>to her, and tried at once to make her feel the blessing



<P>of what was, and prepare her mind for what might be;



<P>and how many walks up and down stairs she might have



<P>saved her, and how many messages she might have carried.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It astonished her that Tom's sisters could be satisfied



<P>with remaining in London at such a time, through an



<P>illness which had now, under different degrees of danger,



<P>lasted several weeks.&nbsp; _They_ might return to Mansfield



<P>when they chose; travelling could be no difficulty to _them_,



<P>and she could not comprehend how both could still keep away.



<P>If Mrs. Rushworth could imagine any interfering obligations,



<P>Julia was certainly able to quit London whenever she chose.



<P>It appeared from one of her aunt's letters that Julia



<P>had offered to return if wanted, but this was all.



<P>It was evident that she would rather remain where she was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was disposed to think the influence of London



<P>very much at war with all respectable attachments.



<P>She saw the proof of it in Miss Crawford, as well as in



<P>her cousins; _her_ attachment to Edmund had been respectable,



<P>the most respectable part of her character; her friendship



<P>for herself had at least been blameless.&nbsp; Where was



<P>either sentiment now?&nbsp; It was so long since Fanny had had



<P>any letter from her, that she had some reason to think



<P>lightly of the friendship which had been so dwelt on.



<P>It was weeks since she had heard anything of Miss Crawford



<P>or of her other connexions in town, except through Mansfield,



<P>and she was beginning to suppose that she might never



<P>know whether Mr. Crawford had gone into Norfolk again



<P>or not till they met, and might never hear from his



<P>sister any more this spring, when the following letter



<P>was received to revive old and create some new sensations--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Forgive me, my dear Fanny, as soon as you can, for my



<P>long silence, and behave as if you could forgive me directly.



<P>This is my modest request and expectation, for you are so good,



<P>that I depend upon being treated better than I deserve,



<P>and I write now to beg an immediate answer.&nbsp; I want to know



<P>the state of things at Mansfield Park, and you, no doubt,



<P>are perfectly able to give it.&nbsp; One should be a brute not



<P>to feel for the distress they are in; and from what I hear,



<P>poor Mr. Bertram has a bad chance of ultimate recovery.



<P>I thought little of his illness at first.&nbsp; I looked



<P>upon him as the sort of person to be made a fuss with,



<P>and to make a fuss himself in any trifling disorder,



<P>and was chiefly concerned for those who had to nurse him;



<P>but now it is confidently asserted that he is really



<P>in a decline, that the symptoms are most alarming,



<P>and that part of the family, at least, are aware of it.



<P>If it be so, I am sure you must be included in that part,



<P>that discerning part, and therefore entreat you to let



<P>me know how far I have been rightly informed.&nbsp; I need



<P>not say how rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been



<P>any mistake, but the report is so prevalent that I confess



<P>I cannot help trembling.&nbsp; To have such a fine young man



<P>cut off in the flower of his days is most melancholy.



<P>Poor Sir Thomas will feel it dreadfully.&nbsp; I really am quite



<P>agitated on the subject.&nbsp; Fanny, Fanny, I see you smile



<P>and look cunning, but, upon my honour, I never bribed



<P>a physician in my life.&nbsp; Poor young man!&nbsp; If he is to die,



<P>there will be _two_ poor young men less in the world;



<P>and with a fearless face and bold voice would I say to any one,



<P>that wealth and consequence could fall into no hands



<P>more deserving of them.&nbsp; It was a foolish precipitation



<P>last Christmas, but the evil of a few days may be blotted



<P>out in part.&nbsp; Varnish and gilding hide many stains.



<P>It will be but the loss of the Esquire after his name.



<P>With real affection, Fanny, like mine, more might be overlooked.



<P>Write to me by return of post, judge of my anxiety,



<P>and do not trifle with it.&nbsp; Tell me the real truth,



<P>as you have it from the fountainhead.&nbsp; And now, do not



<P>trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or



<P>your own.&nbsp; Believe me, they are not only natural, they are



<P>philanthropic and virtuous.&nbsp; I put it to your conscience,



<P>whether 'Sir Edmund' would not do more good with all



<P>the Bertram property than any other possible 'Sir.'



<P>Had the Grants been at home I would not have troubled you,



<P>but you are now the only one I can apply to for the truth,



<P>his sisters not being within my reach.&nbsp; Mrs. R. has



<P>been spending the Easter with the Aylmers at Twickenham



<P>(as to be sure you know), and is not yet returned;



<P>and Julia is with the cousins who live near Bedford Square,



<P>but I forget their name and street.&nbsp; Could I immediately



<P>apply to either, however, I should still prefer you,



<P>because it strikes me that they have all along been so



<P>unwilling to have their own amusements cut up, as to shut



<P>their eyes to the truth.&nbsp; I suppose Mrs. R.'s Easter



<P>holidays will not last much longer; no doubt they are



<P>thorough holidays to her.&nbsp; The Aylmers are pleasant people;



<P>and her husband away, she can have nothing but enjoyment.



<P>I give her credit for promoting his going dutifully down



<P>to Bath, to fetch his mother; but how will she and the



<P>dowager agree in one house?&nbsp; Henry is not at hand, so I



<P>have nothing to say from him.&nbsp; Do not you think Edmund would



<P>have been in town again long ago, but for this illness?--



<P>Yours ever, Mary."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in,



<P>but he brings no intelligence to prevent my sending it.



<P>Mrs. R. knows a decline is apprehended; he saw her this morning:



<P>she returns to Wimpole Street to-day; the old lady is come.



<P>Now do not make yourself uneasy with any queer fancies



<P>because he has been spending a few days at Richmond.



<P>He does it every spring.&nbsp; Be assured he cares for nobody



<P>but you.&nbsp; At this very moment he is wild to see you,



<P>and occupied only in contriving the means for doing so,



<P>and for making his pleasure conduce to yours.&nbsp; In proof,



<P>he repeats, and more eagerly, what he said at Portsmouth



<P>about our conveying you home, and I join him in it with all



<P>my soul.&nbsp; Dear Fanny, write directly, and tell us to come.



<P>It will do us all good.&nbsp; He and I can go to the Parsonage,



<P>you know, and be no trouble to our friends at Mansfield Park.



<P>It would really be gratifying to see them all again, and a



<P>little addition of society might be of infinite use to them;



<P>and as to yourself, you must feel yourself to be so wanted there,



<P>that you cannot in conscience--conscientious as you are--



<P>keep away, when you have the means of returning.



<P>I have not time or patience to give half Henry's messages;



<P>be satisfied that the spirit of each and every one is



<P>unalterable affection."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's disgust at the greater part of this letter,



<P>with her extreme reluctance to bring the writer of it



<P>and her cousin Edmund together, would have made her (as



<P>she felt) incapable of judging impartially whether



<P>the concluding offer might be accepted or not.



<P>To herself, individually, it was most tempting.&nbsp; To be



<P>finding herself, perhaps within three days, transported



<P>to Mansfield, was an image of the greatest felicity,



<P>but it would have been a material drawback to be owing



<P>such felicity to persons in whose feelings and conduct,



<P>at the present moment, she saw so much to condemn:



<P>the sister's feelings, the brother's conduct,



<P>_her_ cold-hearted ambition, _his_ thoughtless vanity.



<P>To have him still the acquaintance, the flirt perhaps,



<P>of Mrs. Rushworth!&nbsp; She was mortified.&nbsp; She had thought



<P>better of him.&nbsp; Happily, however, she was not left to weigh



<P>and decide between opposite inclinations and doubtful



<P>notions of right; there was no occasion to determine



<P>whether she ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not.



<P>She had a rule to apply to, which settled everything.



<P>Her awe of her uncle, and her dread of taking a liberty



<P>with him, made it instantly plain to her what she



<P>had to do.&nbsp; She must absolutely decline the proposal.



<P>If he wanted, he would send for her; and even to offer



<P>an early return was a presumption which hardly anything



<P>would have seemed to justify.&nbsp; She thanked Miss Crawford,



<P>but gave a decided negative.&nbsp; "Her uncle, she understood,



<P>meant to fetch her; and as her cousin's illness had continued



<P>so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary,



<P>she must suppose her return would be unwelcome at present,



<P>and that she should be felt an encumbrance."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her representation of her cousin's state at this time



<P>was exactly according to her own belief of it, and such



<P>as she supposed would convey to the sanguine mind of her



<P>correspondent the hope of everything she was wishing for.



<P>Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman, it seemed,



<P>under certain conditions of wealth; and this, she suspected,



<P>was all the conquest of prejudice which he was so ready



<P>to congratulate himself upon.&nbsp; She had only learnt to think



<P>nothing of consequence but money.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Seven weeks of the two months were very nearly gone,



<P>when the one letter, the letter from Edmund, so long expected,



<P>was put into Fanny's hands.&nbsp; As she opened, and saw



<P>its length, she prepared herself for a minute detail



<P>of happiness and a profusion of love and praise towards



<P>the fortunate creature who was now mistress of his fate.



<P>These were the contents--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My Dear Fanny,--Excuse me that I have not written before.



<P>Crawford told me that you were wishing to hear from me,



<P>but I found it impossible to write from London,



<P>and persuaded myself that you would understand my silence.



<P>Could I have sent a few happy lines, they should not



<P>have been wanting, but nothing of that nature was ever



<P>in my power.&nbsp; I am returned to Mansfield in a less assured



<P>state that when I left it.&nbsp; My hopes are much weaker.



<P>You are probably aware of this already.&nbsp; So very fond of you



<P>as Miss Crawford is, it is most natural that she should tell



<P>you enough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess



<P>at mine.&nbsp; I will not be prevented, however, from making my



<P>own communication.&nbsp; Our confidences in you need not clash.



<P>I ask no questions.&nbsp; There is something soothing in the



<P>idea that we have the same friend, and that whatever



<P>unhappy differences of opinion may exist between us,



<P>we are united in our love of you.&nbsp; It will be a comfort



<P>to me to tell you how things now are, and what are my



<P>present plans, if plans I can be said to have.&nbsp; I have been



<P>returned since Saturday.&nbsp; I was three weeks in London,



<P>and saw her (for London) very often.&nbsp; I had every attention



<P>from the Frasers that could be reasonably expected.



<P>I dare say I was not reasonable in carrying with me



<P>hopes of an intercourse at all like that of Mansfield.



<P>It was her manner, however, rather than any unfrequency



<P>of meeting.&nbsp; Had she been different when I did see her,



<P>I should have made no complaint, but from the very first



<P>she was altered:&nbsp; my first reception was so unlike



<P>what I had hoped, that I had almost resolved on leaving



<P>London again directly.&nbsp; I need not particularise.



<P>You know the weak side of her character, and may imagine



<P>the sentiments and expressions which were torturing me.



<P>She was in high spirits, and surrounded by those who



<P>were giving all the support of their own bad sense



<P>to her too lively mind.&nbsp; I do not like Mrs. Fraser.



<P>She is a cold-hearted, vain woman, who has married entirely



<P>from convenience, and though evidently unhappy in her marriage,



<P>places her disappointment not to faults of judgment,



<P>or temper, or disproportion of age, but to her being,



<P>after all, less affluent than many of her acquaintance,



<P>especially than her sister, Lady Stornaway, and is the



<P>determined supporter of everything mercenary and ambitious,



<P>provided it be only mercenary and ambitious enough.&nbsp; I look



<P>upon her intimacy with those two sisters as the greatest



<P>misfortune of her life and mine.&nbsp; They have been leading



<P>her astray for years.&nbsp; Could she be detached from them!--



<P>and sometimes I do not despair of it, for the affection



<P>appears to me principally on their side.&nbsp; They are very



<P>fond of her; but I am sure she does not love them as she



<P>loves you.&nbsp; When I think of her great attachment to you,



<P>indeed, and the whole of her judicious, upright conduct



<P>as a sister, she appears a very different creature,



<P>capable of everything noble, and I am ready to blame



<P>myself for a too harsh construction of a playful manner.



<P>I cannot give her up, Fanny.&nbsp; She is the only woman



<P>in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife.



<P>If I did not believe that she had some regard for me,



<P>of course I should not say this, but I do believe it.



<P>I am convinced that she is not without a decided preference.



<P>I have no jealousy of any individual.&nbsp; It is the influence



<P>of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous of.



<P>It is the habits of wealth that I fear.&nbsp; Her ideas are



<P>not higher than her own fortune may warrant, but they



<P>are beyond what our incomes united could authorise.



<P>There is comfort, however, even here.&nbsp; I could better



<P>bear to lose her because not rich enough, than because



<P>of my profession.&nbsp; That would only prove her affection



<P>not equal to sacrifices, which, in fact, I am scarcely



<P>justified in asking; and, if I am refused, that, I think,



<P>will be the honest motive.&nbsp; Her prejudices, I trust,



<P>are not so strong as they were.&nbsp; You have my thoughts



<P>exactly as they arise, my dear Fanny; perhaps they are



<P>sometimes contradictory, but it will not be a less faithful



<P>picture of my mind.&nbsp; Having once begun, it is a pleasure



<P>to me to tell you all I feel.&nbsp; I cannot give her up.



<P>Connected as we already are, and, I hope, are to be,



<P>to give up Mary Crawford would be to give up the society



<P>of some of those most dear to me; to banish myself from



<P>the very houses and friends whom, under any other distress,



<P>I should turn to for consolation.&nbsp; The loss of Mary I must



<P>consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of Fanny.



<P>Were it a decided thing, an actual refusal, I hope I



<P>should know how to bear it, and how to endeavour to weaken



<P>her hold on my heart, and in the course of a few years--



<P>but I am writing nonsense.&nbsp; Were I refused, I must bear it;



<P>and till I am, I can never cease to try for her.



<P>This is the truth.&nbsp; The only question is _how_?&nbsp; What may



<P>be the likeliest means?&nbsp; I have sometimes thought of going



<P>to London again after Easter, and sometimes resolved on



<P>doing nothing till she returns to Mansfield.&nbsp; Even now,



<P>she speaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield in June;



<P>but June is at a great distance, and I believe I shall



<P>write to her.&nbsp; I have nearly determined on explaining



<P>myself by letter.&nbsp; To be at an early certainty is a



<P>material object.&nbsp; My present state is miserably irksome.



<P>Considering everything, I think a letter will be decidedly



<P>the best method of explanation.&nbsp; I shall be able to write



<P>much that I could not say, and shall be giving her time



<P>for reflection before she resolves on her answer,



<P>and I am less afraid of the result of reflection



<P>than of an immediate hasty impulse; I think I am.



<P>My greatest danger would lie in her consulting Mrs. Fraser,



<P>and I at a distance unable to help my own cause.



<P>A letter exposes to all the evil of consultation,



<P>and where the mind is anything short of perfect decision,



<P>an adviser may, in an unlucky moment, lead it to do what it



<P>may afterwards regret.&nbsp; I must think this matter over



<P>a little.&nbsp; This long letter, full of my own concerns alone,



<P>will be enough to tire even the friendship of a Fanny.



<P>The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs. Fraser's party.



<P>I am more and more satisfied with all that I see and hear



<P>of him.&nbsp; There is not a shadow of wavering.&nbsp; He thoroughly



<P>knows his own mind, and acts up to his resolutions:



<P>an inestimable quality.&nbsp; I could not see him and my eldest



<P>sister in the same room without recollecting what you



<P>once told me, and I acknowledge that they did not meet



<P>as friends.&nbsp; There was marked coolness on her side.



<P>They scarcely spoke.&nbsp; I saw him draw back surprised,



<P>and I was sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any



<P>former supposed slight to Miss Bertram.&nbsp; You will wish



<P>to hear my opinion of Maria's degree of comfort as a wife.



<P>There is no appearance of unhappiness.&nbsp; I hope they get



<P>on pretty well together.&nbsp; I dined twice in Wimpole Street,



<P>and might have been there oftener, but it is mortifying



<P>to be with Rushworth as a brother.&nbsp; Julia seems to enjoy



<P>London exceedingly.&nbsp; I had little enjoyment there,



<P>but have less here.&nbsp; We are not a lively party.&nbsp; You are



<P>very much wanted.&nbsp; I miss you more than I can express.



<P>My mother desires her best love, and hopes to hear



<P>from you soon.&nbsp; She talks of you almost every hour,



<P>and I am sorry to find how many weeks more she is likely



<P>to be without you.&nbsp; My father means to fetch you himself,



<P>but it will not be till after Easter, when he has



<P>business in town.&nbsp; You are happy at Portsmouth, I hope,



<P>but this must not be a yearly visit.&nbsp; I want you at home,



<P>that I may have your opinion about Thornton Lacey.



<P>I have little heart for extensive improvements till



<P>I know that it will ever have a mistress.&nbsp; I think I



<P>shall certainly write.&nbsp; It is quite settled that the



<P>Grants go to Bath; they leave Mansfield on Monday.



<P>I am glad of it.&nbsp; I am not comfortable enough to be fit



<P>for anybody; but your aunt seems to feel out of luck



<P>that such an article of Mansfield news should fall



<P>to my pen instead of hers.--Yours ever, my dearest



<P>Fanny."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never will, no, I certainly never will wish for a



<P>letter again," was Fanny's secret declaration as she



<P>finished this.&nbsp; "What do they bring but disappointment



<P>and sorrow?&nbsp; Not till after Easter!&nbsp; How shall I bear it?



<P>And my poor aunt talking of me every hour!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny checked the tendency of these thoughts as well as



<P>she could, but she was within half a minute of starting



<P>the idea that Sir Thomas was quite unkind, both to her aunt



<P>and to herself.&nbsp; As for the main subject of the letter,



<P>there was nothing in that to soothe irritation.&nbsp; She was



<P>almost vexed into displeasure and anger against Edmund.



<P>"There is no good in this delay," said she.&nbsp; "Why is not



<P>it settled?&nbsp; He is blinded, and nothing will open his eyes;



<P>nothing can, after having had truths before him so long



<P>in vain.&nbsp; He will marry her, and be poor and miserable.



<P>God grant that her influence do not make him cease



<P>to be respectable!"&nbsp; She looked over the letter again.



<P>"'So very fond of me!' 'tis nonsense all.&nbsp; She loves



<P>nobody but herself and her brother.&nbsp; Her friends leading



<P>her astray for years!&nbsp; She is quite as likely to have led



<P>_them_ astray.&nbsp; They have all, perhaps, been corrupting



<P>one another; but if they are so much fonder of her than



<P>she is of them, she is the less likely to have been hurt,



<P>except by their flattery.&nbsp; 'The only woman in the world



<P>whom he could ever think of as a wife.'&nbsp; I firmly



<P>believe it.&nbsp; It is an attachment to govern his whole life.



<P>Accepted or refused, his heart is wedded to her for ever.



<P>'The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss



<P>of Crawford and Fanny.'&nbsp; Edmund, you do not know me.



<P>The families would never be connected if you did not



<P>connect them!&nbsp; Oh! write, write.&nbsp; Finish it at once.



<P>Let there be an end of this suspense.&nbsp; Fix, commit,



<P>condemn yourself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such sensations, however, were too near akin to



<P>resentment to be long guiding Fanny's soliloquies.



<P>She was soon more softened and sorrowful.&nbsp; His warm regard,



<P>his kind expressions, his confidential treatment,



<P>touched her strongly.&nbsp; He was only too good to everybody.



<P>It was a letter, in short, which she would not but have had



<P>for the world, and which could never be valued enough.



<P>This was the end of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Everybody at all addicted to letter-writing, without



<P>having much to say, which will include a large proportion



<P>of the female world at least, must feel with Lady Bertram



<P>that she was out of luck in having such a capital piece of



<P>Mansfield news as the certainty of the Grants going to Bath,



<P>occur at a time when she could make no advantage of it,



<P>and will admit that it must have been very mortifying



<P>to her to see it fall to the share of her thankless son,



<P>and treated as concisely as possible at the end of a



<P>long letter, instead of having it to spread over the largest



<P>part of a page of her own.&nbsp; For though Lady Bertram rather



<P>shone in the epistolary line, having early in her marriage,



<P>from the want of other employment, and the circumstance



<P>of Sir Thomas's being in Parliament, got into the way



<P>of making and keeping correspondents, and formed for



<P>herself a very creditable, common-place, amplifying style,



<P>so that a very little matter was enough for her:&nbsp; she could



<P>not do entirely without any; she must have something



<P>to write about, even to her niece; and being so soon



<P>to lose all the benefit of Dr. Grant's gouty symptoms



<P>and Mrs. Grant's morning calls, it was very hard upon her



<P>to be deprived of one of the last epistolary uses she could put



<P>them to.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a rich amends, however, preparing for her.



<P>Lady Bertram's hour of good luck came.&nbsp; Within a few days



<P>from the receipt of Edmund's letter, Fanny had one from



<P>her aunt, beginning thus--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My Dear Fanny,--I take up my pen to communicate some



<P>very alarming intelligence, which I make no doubt will



<P>give you much concern".

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was a great deal better than to have to take up the pen



<P>to acquaint her with all the particulars of the Grants'



<P>intended journey, for the present intelligence was of a



<P>nature to promise occupation for the pen for many days



<P>to come, being no less than the dangerous illness of her



<P>eldest son, of which they had received notice by express



<P>a few hours before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Tom had gone from London with a party of young men



<P>to Newmarket, where a neglected fall and a good deal



<P>of drinking had brought on a fever; and when the party



<P>broke up, being unable to move, had been left by himself



<P>at the house of one of these young men to the comforts of



<P>sickness and solitude, and the attendance only of servants.



<P>Instead of being soon well enough to follow his friends,



<P>as he had then hoped, his disorder increased considerably,



<P>and it was not long before he thought so ill of himself



<P>as to be as ready as his physician to have a letter



<P>despatched to Mansfield.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This distressing intelligence, as you may suppose,"



<P>observed her ladyship, after giving the substance of it,



<P>"has agitated us exceedingly, and we cannot prevent



<P>ourselves from being greatly alarmed and apprehensive



<P>for the poor invalid, whose state Sir Thomas fears may



<P>be very critical; and Edmund kindly proposes attending



<P>his brother immediately, but I am happy to add that Sir



<P>Thomas will not leave me on this distressing occasion,



<P>as it would be too trying for me.&nbsp; We shall greatly miss



<P>Edmund in our small circle, but I trust and hope he



<P>will find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than



<P>might be apprehended, and that he will be able to bring



<P>him to Mansfield shortly, which Sir Thomas proposes



<P>should be done, and thinks best on every account, and I



<P>flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able to bear



<P>the removal without material inconvenience or injury.



<P>As I have little doubt of your feeling for us, my dear Fanny,



<P>under these distressing circumstances, I will write again



<P>very soon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's feelings on the occasion were indeed considerably



<P>more warm and genuine than her aunt's style of writing.



<P>She felt truly for them all.&nbsp; Tom dangerously ill,



<P>Edmund gone to attend him, and the sadly small party



<P>remaining at Mansfield, were cares to shut out every



<P>other care, or almost every other.&nbsp; She could just find



<P>selfishness enough to wonder whether Edmund _had_ written



<P>to Miss Crawford before this summons came, but no sentiment



<P>dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate and



<P>disinterestedly anxious.&nbsp; Her aunt did not neglect her:



<P>she wrote again and again; they were receiving frequent



<P>accounts from Edmund, and these accounts were as regularly



<P>transmitted to Fanny, in the same diffuse style,



<P>and the same medley of trusts, hopes, and fears,



<P>all following and producing each other at haphazard.



<P>It was a sort of playing at being frightened.



<P>The sufferings which Lady Bertram did not see had little



<P>power over her fancy; and she wrote very comfortably



<P>about agitation, and anxiety, and poor invalids, till Tom



<P>was actually conveyed to Mansfield, and her own eyes had



<P>beheld his altered appearance.&nbsp; Then a letter which she



<P>had been previously preparing for Fanny was finished



<P>in a different style, in the language of real feeling



<P>and alarm; then she wrote as she might have spoken.



<P>"He is just come, my dear Fanny, and is taken upstairs;



<P>and I am so shocked to see him, that I do not know



<P>what to do.&nbsp; I am sure he has been very ill.&nbsp; Poor Tom!



<P>I am quite grieved for him, and very much frightened,



<P>and so is Sir Thomas; and how glad I should be if you



<P>were here to comfort me.&nbsp; But Sir Thomas hopes he



<P>will be better to-morrow, and says we must consider



<P>his journey."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The real solicitude now awakened in the maternal bosom



<P>was not soon over.&nbsp; Tom's extreme impatience to be



<P>removed to Mansfield, and experience those comforts



<P>of home and family which had been little thought of in



<P>uninterrupted health, had probably induced his being



<P>conveyed thither too early, as a return of fever came on,



<P>and for a week he was in a more alarming state than ever.



<P>They were all very seriously frightened.&nbsp; Lady Bertram



<P>wrote her daily terrors to her niece, who might now be said



<P>to live upon letters, and pass all her time between suffering



<P>from that of to-day and looking forward to to-morrow's.



<P>Without any particular affection for her eldest cousin,



<P>her tenderness of heart made her feel that she could



<P>not spare him, and the purity of her principles added yet



<P>a keener solicitude, when she considered how little useful,



<P>how little self-denying his life had (apparently) been.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Susan was her only companion and listener on this, as on



<P>more common occasions.&nbsp; Susan was always ready to hear and



<P>to sympathise.&nbsp; Nobody else could be interested in so remote



<P>an evil as illness in a family above an hundred miles off;



<P>not even Mrs. Price, beyond a brief question or two,



<P>if she saw her daughter with a letter in her hand,



<P>and now and then the quiet observation of, "My poor



<P>sister Bertram must be in a great deal of trouble."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So long divided and so differently situated, the ties



<P>of blood were little more than nothing.&nbsp; An attachment,



<P>originally as tranquil as their tempers, was now become



<P>a mere name.&nbsp; Mrs. Price did quite as much for Lady



<P>Bertram as Lady Bertram would have done for Mrs. Price.



<P>Three or four Prices might have been swept away,



<P>any or all except Fanny and William, and Lady Bertram



<P>would have thought little about it; or perhaps might have



<P>caught from Mrs. Norris's lips the cant of its being



<P>a very happy thing and a great blessing to their poor



<P>dear sister Price to have them so well provided for.

<B>CHAPTER XXXVII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Mr. Crawford gone, Sir Thomas's next object was that he



<P>should be missed; and he entertained great hope that his



<P>niece would find a blank in the loss of those attentions



<P>which at the time she had felt, or fancied, an evil.



<P>She had tasted of consequence in its most flattering form;



<P>and he did hope that the loss of it, the sinking again



<P>into nothing, would awaken very wholesome regrets



<P>in her mind.&nbsp; He watched her with this idea; but he



<P>could hardly tell with what success.&nbsp; He hardly knew



<P>whether there were any difference in her spirits or not.



<P>She was always so gentle and retiring that her emotions



<P>were beyond his discrimination.&nbsp; He did not understand her:



<P>he felt that he did not; and therefore applied to Edmund



<P>to tell him how she stood affected on the present occasion,



<P>and whether she were more or less happy than she



<P>had been.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund did not discern any symptoms of regret, and thought



<P>his father a little unreasonable in supposing the first



<P>three or four days could produce any.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>What chiefly surprised Edmund was, that Crawford's sister,



<P>the friend and companion who had been so much to her,



<P>should not be more visibly regretted.&nbsp; He wondered that Fanny



<P>spoke so seldom of _her_, and had so little voluntarily



<P>to say of her concern at this separation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Alas! it was this sister, this friend and companion,



<P>who was now the chief bane of Fanny's comfort.&nbsp; If she



<P>could have believed Mary's future fate as unconnected



<P>with Mansfield as she was determined the brother's



<P>should be, if she could have hoped her return thither



<P>to be as distant as she was much inclined to think his,



<P>she would have been light of heart indeed; but the more



<P>she recollected and observed, the more deeply was she



<P>convinced that everything was now in a fairer train



<P>for Miss Crawford's marrying Edmund than it had ever



<P>been before.&nbsp; On his side the inclination was stronger,



<P>on hers less equivocal.&nbsp; His objections, the scruples of



<P>his integrity, seemed all done away, nobody could tell how;



<P>and the doubts and hesitations of her ambition were



<P>equally got over--and equally without apparent reason.



<P>It could only be imputed to increasing attachment.



<P>His good and her bad feelings yielded to love, and such



<P>love must unite them.&nbsp; He was to go to town as soon as



<P>some business relative to Thornton Lacey were completed--



<P>perhaps within a fortnight; he talked of going,



<P>he loved to talk of it; and when once with her again,



<P>Fanny could not doubt the rest.&nbsp; Her acceptance must



<P>be as certain as his offer; and yet there were bad



<P>feelings still remaining which made the prospect of it



<P>most sorrowful to her, independently, she believed,



<P>independently of self.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In their very last conversation, Miss Crawford, in spite



<P>of some amiable sensations, and much personal kindness,



<P>had still been Miss Crawford; still shewn a mind led astray



<P>and bewildered, and without any suspicion of being so;



<P>darkened, yet fancying itself light.&nbsp; She might love,



<P>but she did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment.



<P>Fanny believed there was scarcely a second feeling



<P>in common between them; and she may be forgiven by older



<P>sages for looking on the chance of Miss Crawford's future



<P>improvement as nearly desperate, for thinking that if Edmund's



<P>influence in this season of love had already done so little



<P>in clearing her judgment, and regulating her notions,



<P>his worth would be finally wasted on her even in years



<P>of matrimony.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Experience might have hoped more for any young people



<P>so circumstanced, and impartiality would not have denied



<P>to Miss Crawford's nature that participation of the general



<P>nature of women which would lead her to adopt the opinions



<P>of the man she loved and respected as her own.&nbsp; But as such



<P>were Fanny's persuasions, she suffered very much from them,



<P>and could never speak of Miss Crawford without pain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas, meanwhile, went on with his own hopes and



<P>his own observations, still feeling a right, by all his



<P>knowledge of human nature, to expect to see the effect



<P>of the loss of power and consequence on his niece's spirits,



<P>and the past attentions of the lover producing a craving



<P>for their return; and he was soon afterwards able to account



<P>for his not yet completely and indubitably seeing all this,



<P>by the prospect of another visitor, whose approach he



<P>could allow to be quite enough to support the spirits



<P>he was watching.&nbsp; William had obtained a ten days'



<P>leave of absence, to be given to Northamptonshire,



<P>and was coming, the happiest of lieutenants, because the



<P>latest made, to shew his happiness and describe his uniform.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He came; and he would have been delighted to shew his uniform



<P>there too, had not cruel custom prohibited its appearance



<P>except on duty.&nbsp; So the uniform remained at Portsmouth,



<P>and Edmund conjectured that before Fanny had any chance



<P>of seeing it, all its own freshness and all the freshness



<P>of its wearer's feelings must be worn away.&nbsp; It would be sunk



<P>into a badge of disgrace; for what can be more unbecoming,



<P>or more worthless, than the uniform of a lieutenant,



<P>who has been a lieutenant a year or two, and sees



<P>others made commanders before him?&nbsp; So reasoned Edmund,



<P>till his father made him the confidant of a scheme which



<P>placed Fanny's chance of seeing the second lieutenant



<P>of H.M.S. Thrush in all his glory in another light.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This scheme was that she should accompany her brother



<P>back to Portsmouth, and spend a little time with her



<P>own family.&nbsp; It had occurred to Sir Thomas, in one of his



<P>dignified musings, as a right and desirable measure;



<P>but before he absolutely made up his mind, he consulted



<P>his son.&nbsp; Edmund considered it every way, and saw nothing



<P>but what was right.&nbsp; The thing was good in itself,



<P>and could not be done at a better time; and he had no doubt



<P>of it being highly agreeable to Fanny.&nbsp; This was enough



<P>to determine Sir Thomas; and a decisive "then so it shall be"



<P>closed that stage of the business; Sir Thomas retiring



<P>from it with some feelings of satisfaction, and views



<P>of good over and above what he had communicated to his son;



<P>for his prime motive in sending her away had very little



<P>to do with the propriety of her seeing her parents again,



<P>and nothing at all with any idea of making her happy.



<P>He certainly wished her to go willingly, but he as certainly



<P>wished her to be heartily sick of home before her visit ended;



<P>and that a little abstinence from the elegancies and luxuries



<P>of Mansfield Park would bring her mind into a sober state,



<P>and incline her to a juster estimate of the value



<P>of that home of greater permanence, and equal comfort,



<P>of which she had the offer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a medicinal project upon his niece's understanding,



<P>which he must consider as at present diseased.



<P>A residence of eight or nine years in the abode of wealth



<P>and plenty had a little disordered her powers of comparing



<P>and judging.&nbsp; Her father's house would, in all probability,



<P>teach her the value of a good income; and he trusted that



<P>she would be the wiser and happier woman, all her life,



<P>for the experiment he had devised.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Had Fanny been at all addicted to raptures, she must have



<P>had a strong attack of them when she first understood



<P>what was intended, when her uncle first made her the offer



<P>of visiting the parents, and brothers, and sisters,



<P>from whom she had been divided almost half her life;



<P>of returning for a couple of months to the scenes of



<P>her infancy, with William for the protector and companion



<P>of her journey, and the certainty of continuing to see



<P>William to the last hour of his remaining on land.



<P>Had she ever given way to bursts of delight, it must have



<P>been then, for she was delighted, but her happiness was



<P>of a quiet, deep, heart-swelling sort; and though never



<P>a great talker, she was always more inclined to silence



<P>when feeling most strongly.&nbsp; At the moment she could



<P>only thank and accept.&nbsp; Afterwards, when familiarised



<P>with the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened, she could



<P>speak more largely to William and Edmund of what she felt;



<P>but still there were emotions of tenderness that could



<P>not be clothed in words.&nbsp; The remembrance of all her



<P>earliest pleasures, and of what she had suffered in being



<P>torn from them, came over her with renewed strength,



<P>and it seemed as if to be at home again would heal



<P>every pain that had since grown out of the separation.



<P>To be in the centre of such a circle, loved by so many,



<P>and more loved by all than she had ever been before;



<P>to feel affection without fear or restraint; to feel



<P>herself the equal of those who surrounded her; to be at



<P>peace from all mention of the Crawfords, safe from every



<P>look which could be fancied a reproach on their account.



<P>This was a prospect to be dwelt on with a fondness that could



<P>be but half acknowledged.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund, too--to be two months from _him_ (and perhaps



<P>she might be allowed to make her absence three)



<P>must do her good.&nbsp; At a distance, unassailed by his looks



<P>or his kindness, and safe from the perpetual irritation



<P>of knowing his heart, and striving to avoid his confidence,



<P>she should be able to reason herself into a properer state;



<P>she should be able to think of him as in London,



<P>and arranging everything there, without wretchedness.



<P>What might have been hard to bear at Mansfield was to become



<P>a slight evil at Portsmouth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The only drawback was the doubt of her aunt Bertram's being



<P>comfortable without her.&nbsp; She was of use to no one else;



<P>but _there_ she might be missed to a degree that she did



<P>not like to think of; and that part of the arrangement



<P>was, indeed, the hardest for Sir Thomas to accomplish,



<P>and what only _he_ could have accomplished at all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But he was master at Mansfield Park.&nbsp; When he had really



<P>resolved on any measure, he could always carry it through;



<P>and now by dint of long talking on the subject,



<P>explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny's sometimes



<P>seeing her family, he did induce his wife to let her go;



<P>obtaining it rather from submission, however, than conviction,



<P>for Lady Bertram was convinced of very little more than



<P>that Sir Thomas thought Fanny ought to go, and therefore



<P>that she must.&nbsp; In the calmness of her own dressing-room,



<P>in the impartial flow of her own meditations, unbiassed by



<P>his bewildering statements, she could not acknowledge any



<P>necessity for Fanny's ever going near a father and mother



<P>who had done without her so long, while she was so useful



<P>to herself And as to the not missing her, which under



<P>Mrs. Norris's discussion was the point attempted to be proved,



<P>she set herself very steadily against admitting any such thing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas had appealed to her reason, conscience, and dignity.



<P>He called it a sacrifice, and demanded it of her goodness



<P>and self-command as such.&nbsp; But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade



<P>her that Fanny could be very well spared--_she_ being



<P>ready to give up all her own time to her as requested--



<P>and, in short, could not really be wanted or missed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That may be, sister," was all Lady Bertram's reply.



<P>"I dare say you are very right; but I am sure I shall miss



<P>her very much."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The next step was to communicate with Portsmouth.&nbsp; Fanny wrote



<P>to offer herself; and her mother's answer, though short,



<P>was so kind--a few simple lines expressed so natural and



<P>motherly a joy in the prospect of seeing her child again,



<P>as to confirm all the daughter's views of happiness in



<P>being with her--convincing her that she should now find



<P>a warm and affectionate friend in the "mama" who had



<P>certainly shewn no remarkable fondness for her formerly;



<P>but this she could easily suppose to have been her own



<P>fault or her own fancy.&nbsp; She had probably alienated love



<P>by the helplessness and fretfulness of a fearful temper,



<P>or been unreasonable in wanting a larger share than



<P>any one among so many could deserve.&nbsp; Now, when she



<P>knew better how to be useful, and how to forbear,



<P>and when her mother could be no longer occupied by the



<P>incessant demands of a house full of little children,



<P>there would be leisure and inclination for every comfort,



<P>and they should soon be what mother and daughter ought



<P>to be to each other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>William was almost as happy in the plan as his sister.



<P>It would be the greatest pleasure to him to have her there



<P>to the last moment before he sailed, and perhaps find



<P>her there still when he came in from his first cruise.



<P>And besides, he wanted her so very much to see the Thrush



<P>before she went out of harbour--the Thrush was certainly



<P>the finest sloop in the service--and there were several



<P>improvements in the dockyard, too, which he quite longed to



<P>shew her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He did not scruple to add that her being at home



<P>for a while would be a great advantage to everybody.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know how it is," said he; "but we seem to want



<P>some of your nice ways and orderliness at my father's. The



<P>house is always in confusion.&nbsp; You will set things going



<P>in a better way, I am sure.&nbsp; You will tell my mother how it



<P>all ought to be, and you will be so useful to Susan, and you



<P>will teach Betsey, and make the boys love and mind you.



<P>How right and comfortable it will all be!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By the time Mrs. Price's answer arrived, there remained



<P>but a very few days more to be spent at Mansfield;



<P>and for part of one of those days the young travellers



<P>were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of their



<P>journey, for when the mode of it came to be talked of,



<P>and Mrs. Norris found that all her anxiety to save her



<P>brother-in-law's money was vain, and that in spite of her



<P>wishes and hints for a less expensive conveyance of Fanny,



<P>they were to travel post; when she saw Sir Thomas actually



<P>give William notes for the purpose, she was struck with



<P>the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage,



<P>and suddenly seized with a strong inclination to go



<P>with them, to go and see her poor dear sister Price.



<P>She proclaimed her thoughts.&nbsp; She must say that she



<P>had more than half a mind to go with the young people;



<P>it would be such an indulgence to her; she had not seen



<P>her poor dear sister Price for more than twenty years;



<P>and it would be a help to the young people in their journey



<P>to have her older head to manage for them; and she could



<P>not help thinking her poor dear sister Price would feel it



<P>very unkind of her not to come by such an opportunity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>William and Fanny were horror-struck at the idea.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All the comfort of their comfortable journey would



<P>be destroyed at once.&nbsp; With woeful countenances they



<P>looked at each other.&nbsp; Their suspense lasted an hour



<P>or two.&nbsp; No one interfered to encourage or dissuade.



<P>Mrs. Norris was left to settle the matter by herself;



<P>and it ended, to the infinite joy of her nephew and niece,



<P>in the recollection that she could not possibly be spared



<P>from Mansfield Park at present; that she was a great deal



<P>too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram for her to be



<P>able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a week,



<P>and therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure



<P>to that of being useful to them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It had, in fact, occurred to her, that though taken



<P>to Portsmouth for nothing, it would be hardly possible



<P>for her to avoid paying her own expenses back again.



<P>So her poor dear sister Price was left to all the



<P>disappointment of her missing such an opportunity,



<P>and another twenty years' absence, perhaps, begun.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund's plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey,



<P>this absence of Fanny's. He too had a sacrifice to make



<P>to Mansfield Park as well as his aunt.&nbsp; He had intended,



<P>about this time, to be going to London; but he could



<P>not leave his father and mother just when everybody else



<P>of most importance to their comfort was leaving them;



<P>and with an effort, felt but not boasted of, he delayed



<P>for a week or two longer a journey which he was looking



<P>forward to with the hope of its fixing his happiness



<P>for ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He told Fanny of it.&nbsp; She knew so much already,



<P>that she must know everything.&nbsp; It made the substance



<P>of one other confidential discourse about Miss Crawford;



<P>and Fanny was the more affected from feeling it to be



<P>the last time in which Miss Crawford's name would ever



<P>be mentioned between them with any remains of liberty.



<P>Once afterwards she was alluded to by him.&nbsp; Lady Bertram had



<P>been telling her niece in the evening to write to her soon



<P>and often, and promising to be a good correspondent herself;



<P>and Edmund, at a convenient moment, then added in a whisper,



<P>"And _I_ shall write to you, Fanny, when I have anything



<P>worth writing about, anything to say that I think you



<P>will like to hear, and that you will not hear so soon



<P>from any other quarter."&nbsp; Had she doubted his meaning



<P>while she listened, the glow in his face, when she looked



<P>up at him, would have been decisive.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For this letter she must try to arm herself.&nbsp; That a



<P>letter from Edmund should be a subject of terror!



<P>She began to feel that she had not yet gone through all



<P>the changes of opinion and sentiment which the progress



<P>of time and variation of circumstances occasion in this



<P>world of changes.&nbsp; The vicissitudes of the human mind



<P>had not yet been exhausted by her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor Fanny! though going as she did willingly and eagerly,



<P>the last evening at Mansfield Park must still



<P>be wretchedness.&nbsp; Her heart was completely sad at parting.



<P>She had tears for every room in the house, much more



<P>for every beloved inhabitant.&nbsp; She clung to her aunt,



<P>because she would miss her; she kissed the hand of her



<P>uncle with struggling sobs, because she had displeased him;



<P>and as for Edmund, she could neither speak, nor look,



<P>nor think, when the last moment came with _him_; and it



<P>was not till it was over that she knew he was giving



<P>her the affectionate farewell of a brother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All this passed overnight, for the journey was to



<P>begin very early in the morning; and when the small,



<P>diminished party met at breakfast, William and Fanny



<P>were talked of as already advanced one stage.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>"But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny?" said Lady Bertram.



<P>"How came she to think of asking Fanny?&nbsp; Fanny never



<P>dines there, you know, in this sort of way.&nbsp; I cannot



<P>spare her, and I am sure she does not want to go.



<P>Fanny, you do not want to go, do you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you put such a question to her," cried Edmund,



<P>preventing his cousin's speaking, "Fanny will immediately



<P>say No; but I am sure, my dear mother, she would like to go;



<P>and I can see no reason why she should not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her?



<P>She never did before.&nbsp; She used to ask your sisters now



<P>and then, but she never asked Fanny."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you cannot do without me, ma'am--" said Fanny,



<P>in a self-denying tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But my mother will have my father with her all the evening."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure, so I shall."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Suppose you take my father's opinion, ma'am."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's well thought of.&nbsp; So I will, Edmund.&nbsp; I will



<P>ask Sir Thomas, as soon as he comes in, whether I can



<P>do without her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As you please, ma'am, on that head; but I meant my



<P>father's opinion as to the _propriety_ of the invitation's



<P>being accepted or not; and I think he will consider



<P>it a right thing by Mrs. Grant, as well as by Fanny,



<P>that being the _first_ invitation it should be accepted."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know.&nbsp; We will ask him.&nbsp; But he will be very



<P>much surprised that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was nothing more to be said, or that could be



<P>said to any purpose, till Sir Thomas were present;



<P>but the subject involving, as it did, her own evening's



<P>comfort for the morrow, was so much uppermost in Lady



<P>Bertram's mind, that half an hour afterwards, on his



<P>looking in for a minute in his way from his plantation



<P>to his dressing-room, she called him back again,



<P>when he had almost closed the door, with "Sir Thomas,



<P>stop a moment--I have something to say to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her tone of calm languor, for she never took the trouble



<P>of raising her voice, was always heard and attended to;



<P>and Sir Thomas came back.&nbsp; Her story began; and Fanny



<P>immediately slipped out of the room; for to hear herself



<P>the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more



<P>than her nerves could bear.&nbsp; She was anxious, she knew--



<P>more anxious perhaps than she ought to be--for what was



<P>it after all whether she went or staid? but if her uncle



<P>were to be a great while considering and deciding,



<P>and with very grave looks, and those grave looks directed



<P>to her, and at last decide against her, she might not



<P>be able to appear properly submissive and indifferent.



<P>Her cause, meanwhile, went on well.&nbsp; It began, on Lady



<P>Bertram's part, with--"I have something to tell you



<P>that will surprise you.&nbsp; Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny



<P>to dinner."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said Sir Thomas, as if waiting more to accomplish



<P>the surprise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Edmund wants her to go.&nbsp; But how can I spare her?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She will be late," said Sir Thomas, taking out his watch;



<P>"but what is your difficulty?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund found himself obliged to speak and fill up



<P>the blanks in his mother's story.&nbsp; He told the whole;



<P>and she had only to add, "So strange! for Mrs. Grant



<P>never used to ask her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But is it not very natural," observed Edmund,



<P>"that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable



<P>a visitor for her sister?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing can be more natural," said Sir Thomas, after a



<P>short deliberation; "nor, were there no sister in the case,



<P>could anything, in my opinion, be more natural.



<P>Mrs. Grant's shewing civility to Miss Price, to Lady



<P>Bertram's niece, could never want explanation.&nbsp; The only



<P>surprise I can feel is, that this should be the _first_



<P>time of its being paid.&nbsp; Fanny was perfectly right in



<P>giving only a conditional answer.&nbsp; She appears to feel



<P>as she ought.&nbsp; But as I conclude that she must wish to go,



<P>since all young people like to be together, I can see



<P>no reason why she should be denied the indulgence."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But can I do without her, Sir Thomas?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed I think you may."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She always makes tea, you know, when my sister is not here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your sister, perhaps, may be prevailed on to spend



<P>the day with us, and I shall certainly be at home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well, then, Fanny may go, Edmund."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The good news soon followed her.&nbsp; Edmund knocked at her



<P>door in his way to his own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Fanny, it is all happily settled, and without



<P>the smallest hesitation on your uncle's side.



<P>He had but one opinion.&nbsp; You are to go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, I am _so_ glad," was Fanny's instinctive reply;



<P>though when she had turned from him and shut the door,



<P>she could not help feeling, "And yet why should I be glad?



<P>for am I not certain of seeing or hearing something there



<P>to pain me?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In spite of this conviction, however, she was glad.



<P>Simple as such an engagement might appear in other eyes,



<P>it had novelty and importance in hers, for excepting the



<P>day at Sotherton, she had scarcely ever dined out before;



<P>and though now going only half a mile, and only to



<P>three people, still it was dining out, and all the little



<P>interests of preparation were enjoyments in themselves.



<P>She had neither sympathy nor assistance from those who ought



<P>to have entered into her feelings and directed her taste;



<P>for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to anybody,



<P>and Mrs. Norris, when she came on the morrow, in consequence



<P>of an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas, was in



<P>a very ill humour, and seemed intent only on lessening



<P>her niece's pleasure, both present and future, as much



<P>as possible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word, Fanny, you are in high luck to meet



<P>with such attention and indulgence!&nbsp; You ought to be



<P>very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for thinking of you,



<P>and to your aunt for letting you go, and you ought to look



<P>upon it as something extraordinary; for I hope you are



<P>aware that there is no real occasion for your going into



<P>company in this sort of way, or ever dining out at all;



<P>and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated.



<P>Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant



<P>as any particular compliment to _you_; the compliment



<P>is intended to your uncle and aunt and me.&nbsp; Mrs. Grant



<P>thinks it a civility due to _us_ to take a little notice



<P>of you, or else it would never have come into her head,



<P>and you may be very certain that, if your cousin Julia



<P>had been at home, you would not have been asked at all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all



<P>Mrs. Grant's part of the favour, that Fanny, who found



<P>herself expected to speak, could only say that she was



<P>very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her,



<P>and that she was endeavouring to put her aunt's evening



<P>work in such a state as to prevent her being missed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! depend upon it, your aunt can do very well without you,



<P>or you would not be allowed to go.&nbsp; _I_ shall be here, so you



<P>may be quite easy about your aunt.&nbsp; And I hope you will have



<P>a very _agreeable_ day, and find it all mighty _delightful_.



<P>But I must observe that five is the very awkwardest of



<P>all possible numbers to sit down to table; and I cannot



<P>but be surprised that such an _elegant_ lady as Mrs. Grant



<P>should not contrive better!&nbsp; And round their enormous great



<P>wide table, too, which fills up the room so dreadfully!



<P>Had the doctor been contented to take my dining-table when I



<P>came away, as anybody in their senses would have done,



<P>instead of having that absurd new one of his own,



<P>which is wider, literally wider than the dinner-table here,



<P>how infinitely better it would have been! and how much



<P>more he would have been respected! for people are never



<P>respected when they step out of their proper sphere.



<P>Remember that, Fanny.&nbsp; Five--only five to be sitting



<P>round that table.&nbsp; However, you will have dinner enough



<P>on it for ten, I dare say."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris fetched breath, and went on again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The nonsense and folly of people's stepping out of their



<P>rank and trying to appear above themselves, makes me



<P>think it right to give _you_ a hint, Fanny, now that you



<P>are going into company without any of us; and I do beseech



<P>and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward,



<P>and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of



<P>your cousins--as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia.



<P>_That_ will never do, believe me.&nbsp; Remember, wherever you are,



<P>you must be the lowest and last; and though Miss Crawford



<P>is in a manner at home at the Parsonage, you are not to



<P>be taking place of her.&nbsp; And as to coming away at night,



<P>you are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses.



<P>Leave him to settle _that_."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, ma'am, I should not think of anything else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And if it should rain, which I think exceedingly likely,



<P>for I never saw it more threatening for a wet evening



<P>in my life, you must manage as well as you can, and not be



<P>expecting the carriage to be sent for you.&nbsp; I certainly



<P>do not go home to-night, and, therefore, the carriage will



<P>not be out on my account; so you must make up your mind



<P>to what may happen, and take your things accordingly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her niece thought it perfectly reasonable.&nbsp; She rated her



<P>own claims to comfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could;



<P>and when Sir Thomas soon afterwards, just opening



<P>the door, said, "Fanny, at what time would you have the



<P>carriage come round?" she felt a degree of astonishment



<P>which made it impossible for her to speak.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Sir Thomas!" cried Mrs. Norris, red with anger,



<P>"Fanny can walk."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Walk!" repeated Sir Thomas, in a tone of most unanswerable



<P>dignity, and coming farther into the room.&nbsp; "My niece



<P>walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year!



<P>Will twenty minutes after four suit you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, sir," was Fanny's humble answer, given with the



<P>feelings almost of a criminal towards Mrs. Norris;



<P>and not bearing to remain with her in what might seem



<P>a state of triumph, she followed her uncle out of the room,



<P>having staid behind him only long enough to hear these



<P>words spoken in angry agitation--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Quite unnecessary! a great deal too kind!



<P>But Edmund goes; true, it is upon Edmund's account.



<P>I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But this could not impose on Fanny.&nbsp; She felt that



<P>the carriage was for herself, and herself alone:



<P>and her uncle's consideration of her, coming immediately



<P>after such representations from her aunt, cost her



<P>some tears of gratitude when she was alone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The coachman drove round to a minute; another minute



<P>brought down the gentleman; and as the lady had, with a



<P>most scrupulous fear of being late, been many minutes



<P>seated in the drawing-room, Sir Thomas saw them off



<P>in as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now I must look at you, Fanny," said Edmund, with the



<P>kind smile of an affectionate brother, "and tell you



<P>how I like you; and as well as I can judge by this light,



<P>you look very nicely indeed.&nbsp; What have you got on?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me



<P>on my cousin's marriage.&nbsp; I hope it is not too fine; but I



<P>thought I ought to wear it as soon as I could, and that I



<P>might not have such another opportunity all the winter.



<P>I hope you do not think me too fine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white.&nbsp; No,

I



<P>see



<P>no finery about you; nothing but what is perfectly proper.



<P>Your gown seems very pretty.&nbsp; I like these glossy spots.



<P>Has not Miss Crawford a gown something the same?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In approaching the Parsonage they passed close by the



<P>stable-yard and coach-house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Heyday!" said Edmund, "here's company, here's a carriage!



<P>who have they got to meet us?"&nbsp; And letting down the side-glass



<P>to distinguish, "'Tis Crawford's, Crawford's barouche,



<P>I protest!&nbsp; There are his own two men pushing it back



<P>into its old quarters.&nbsp; He is here, of course.&nbsp; This is



<P>quite a surprise, Fanny.&nbsp; I shall be very glad to see him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was no occasion, there was no time for Fanny



<P>to say how very differently she felt; but the idea



<P>of having such another to observe her was a great



<P>increase of the trepidation with which she performed



<P>the very awful ceremony of walking into the drawing-room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the drawing-room Mr. Crawford certainly was, having been



<P>just long enough arrived to be ready for dinner; and the



<P>smiles and pleased looks of the three others standing



<P>round him, shewed how welcome was his sudden resolution



<P>of coming to them for a few days on leaving Bath.



<P>A very cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund;



<P>and with the exception of Fanny, the pleasure was general;



<P>and even to _her_ there might be some advantage in



<P>his presence, since every addition to the party must



<P>rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered



<P>to sit silent and unattended to.&nbsp; She was soon aware



<P>of this herself; for though she must submit, as her



<P>own propriety of mind directed, in spite of her aunt



<P>Norris's opinion, to being the principal lady in company,



<P>and to all the little distinctions consequent thereon,



<P>she found, while they were at table, such a happy flow



<P>of conversation prevailing, in which she was not required



<P>to take any part--there was so much to be said between



<P>the brother and sister about Bath, so much between



<P>the two young men about hunting, so much of politics



<P>between Mr. Crawford and Dr. Grant, and of everything



<P>and all together between Mr. Crawford and Mrs. Grant,



<P>as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to



<P>listen in quiet, and of passing a very agreeable day.



<P>She could not compliment the newly arrived gentleman,



<P>however, with any appearance of interest, in a scheme



<P>for extending his stay at Mansfield, and sending for his



<P>hunters from Norfolk, which, suggested by Dr. Grant,



<P>advised by Edmund, and warmly urged by the two sisters,



<P>was soon in possession of his mind, and which he seemed



<P>to want to be encouraged even by her to resolve on.



<P>Her opinion was sought as to the probable continuance



<P>of the open weather, but her answers were as short



<P>and indifferent as civility allowed.&nbsp; She could not wish



<P>him to stay, and would much rather not have him speak



<P>to her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her two absent cousins, especially Maria, were much in her



<P>thoughts on seeing him; but no embarrassing remembrance



<P>affected _his_ spirits.&nbsp; Here he was again on the same



<P>ground where all had passed before, and apparently as



<P>willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams,



<P>as if he had never known Mansfield in any other state.



<P>She heard them spoken of by him only in a general way,



<P>till they were all re-assembled in the drawing-room,



<P>when Edmund, being engaged apart in some matter of business



<P>with Dr. Grant, which seemed entirely to engross them,



<P>and Mrs. Grant occupied at the tea-table, he began talking



<P>of them with more particularity to his other sister.



<P>With a significant smile, which made Fanny quite hate him,



<P>he said, "So!&nbsp; Rushworth and his fair bride are at Brighton,



<P>I understand; happy man!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, they have been there about a fortnight, Miss Price,



<P>have they not?&nbsp; And Julia is with them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And Mr. Yates, I presume, is not far off."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Yates!&nbsp; Oh! we hear nothing of Mr. Yates.&nbsp; I do not



<P>imagine he figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park;



<P>do you, Miss Price?&nbsp; I think my friend Julia knows better



<P>than to entertain her father with Mr. Yates."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor Rushworth and his two-and-forty speeches!"



<P>continued Crawford.&nbsp; "Nobody can ever forget them.



<P>Poor fellow!&nbsp; I see him now--his toil and his despair.



<P>Well, I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever



<P>want him to make two-and-forty speeches to her"; adding,



<P>with a momentary seriousness, "She is too good for him--



<P>much too good."&nbsp; And then changing his tone again to one



<P>of gentle gallantry, and addressing Fanny, he said,



<P>"You were Mr. Rushworth's best friend.&nbsp; Your kindness and



<P>patience can never be forgotten, your indefatigable patience



<P>in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part--



<P>in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied--



<P>to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity



<P>of your own!&nbsp; _He_ might not have sense enough himself



<P>to estimate your kindness, but I may venture to say that it



<P>had honour from all the rest of the party."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny coloured, and said nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is as a dream, a pleasant dream!" he exclaimed,



<P>breaking forth again, after a few minutes' musing.&nbsp; "I shall



<P>always look back on our theatricals with exquisite pleasure.



<P>There was such an interest, such an animation, such a



<P>spirit diffused.&nbsp; Everybody felt it.&nbsp; We were all alive.



<P>There was employment, hope, solicitude, bustle, for every



<P>hour of the day.&nbsp; Always some little objection,



<P>some little doubt, some little anxiety to be got over.



<P>I never was happier."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With silent indignation Fanny repeated to herself,



<P>"Never happier!--never happier than when doing what



<P>you must know was not justifiable!--never happier



<P>than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly!



<P>Oh! what a corrupted mind!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We were unlucky, Miss Price," he continued, in a lower tone,



<P>to avoid the possibility of being heard by Edmund,



<P>and not at all aware of her feelings, "we certainly



<P>were very unlucky.&nbsp; Another week, only one other week,



<P>would have been enough for us.&nbsp; I think if we had had the



<P>disposal of events--if Mansfield Park had had the government



<P>of the winds just for a week or two, about the equinox,



<P>there would have been a difference.&nbsp; Not that we would



<P>have endangered his safety by any tremendous weather--



<P>but only by a steady contrary wind, or a calm.&nbsp; I think,



<P>Miss Price, we would have indulged ourselves with a week's



<P>calm in the Atlantic at that season."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He seemed determined to be answered; and Fanny,



<P>averting her face, said, with a firmer tone than usual,



<P>"As far as _I_ am concerned, sir, I would not have



<P>delayed his return for a day.&nbsp; My uncle disapproved it



<P>all so entirely when he did arrive, that in my opinion



<P>everything had gone quite far enough."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had never spoken so much at once to him in her life before,



<P>and never so angrily to any one; and when her speech was over,



<P>she trembled and blushed at her own daring.&nbsp; He was surprised;



<P>but after a few moments' silent consideration of her,



<P>replied in a calmer, graver tone, and as if the candid



<P>result of conviction, "I believe you are right.&nbsp; It was



<P>more pleasant than prudent.&nbsp; We were getting too noisy."



<P>And then turning the conversation, he would have engaged



<P>her on some other subject, but her answers were so shy



<P>and reluctant that he could not advance in any.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford, who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant



<P>and Edmund, now observed, "Those gentlemen must have



<P>some very interesting point to discuss."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The most interesting in the world," replied her brother--



<P>"how to make money; how to turn a good income into a better.



<P>Dr. Grant is giving Bertram instructions about the living



<P>he is to step into so soon.&nbsp; I find he takes orders



<P>in a few weeks.&nbsp; They were at it in the dining-parlour.



<P>I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off.&nbsp; He will



<P>have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with,



<P>and earned without much trouble.&nbsp; I apprehend he will



<P>not have less than seven hundred a year.&nbsp; Seven hundred



<P>a year is a fine thing for a younger brother; and as of



<P>course he will still live at home, it will be all for his



<P>_menus_ _plaisirs_; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter,



<P>I suppose, will be the sum total of sacrifice."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His sister tried to laugh off her feelings by saying,



<P>"Nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody



<P>settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less



<P>than themselves.&nbsp; You would look rather blank, Henry, if your



<P>_menus_ _plaisirs_ were to be limited to seven hundred a year."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps I might; but all _that_ you know is



<P>entirely comparative.&nbsp; Birthright and habit must settle



<P>the business.&nbsp; Bertram is certainly well off for a cadet



<P>of even a baronet's family.&nbsp; By the time he is four or five



<P>and twenty he will have seven hundred a year, and nothing to do for



<P>it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford _could_ have said that there would



<P>be a something to do and to suffer for it, which she



<P>could not think lightly of; but she checked herself



<P>and let it pass; and tried to look calm and unconcerned



<P>when the two gentlemen shortly afterwards joined them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bertram," said Henry Crawford, "I shall make a point of



<P>coming to Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon.



<P>I shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner.



<P>When is it to be?&nbsp; Miss Price, will not you join me in



<P>encouraging your cousin?&nbsp; Will not you engage to attend



<P>with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time--



<P>as I shall do--not to lose a word; or only looking off



<P>just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful?



<P>We will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil.



<P>When will it be?&nbsp; You must preach at Mansfield, you know,



<P>that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can,"



<P>said Edmund; "for you would be more likely to disconcert me,



<P>and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than



<P>almost any other man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Will he not feel this?" thought Fanny.&nbsp; "No, he can feel



<P>nothing as he ought."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The party being now all united, and the chief talkers



<P>attracting each other, she remained in tranquillity;



<P>and as a whist-table was formed after tea--formed really



<P>for the amusement of Dr. Grant, by his attentive wife,



<P>though it was not to be supposed so--and Miss Crawford



<P>took her harp, she had nothing to do but to listen;



<P>and her tranquillity remained undisturbed the rest



<P>of the evening, except when Mr. Crawford now and then



<P>addressed to her a question or observation, which she



<P>could not avoid answering.&nbsp; Miss Crawford was too much



<P>vexed by what had passed to be in a humour for anything



<P>but music.&nbsp; With that she soothed herself and amused



<P>her friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The assurance of Edmund's being so soon to take orders,



<P>coming upon her like a blow that had been suspended,



<P>and still hoped uncertain and at a distance, was felt



<P>with resentment and mortification.&nbsp; She was very angry



<P>with him.&nbsp; She had thought her influence more.



<P>She _had_ begun to think of him; she felt that she had,



<P>with great regard, with almost decided intentions;



<P>but she would now meet him with his own cool feelings.



<P>It was plain that he could have no serious views, no true



<P>attachment, by fixing himself in a situation which he must



<P>know she would never stoop to.&nbsp; She would learn to match



<P>him in his indifference.&nbsp; She would henceforth admit his



<P>attentions without any idea beyond immediate amusement.



<P>If _he_ could so command his affections, _hers_ should do her



<P>no harm.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Fanny's consequence increased on the departure of



<P>her cousins.&nbsp; Becoming, as she then did, the only young



<P>woman in the drawing-room, the only occupier of that



<P>interesting division of a family in which she had hitherto



<P>held so humble a third, it was impossible for her not



<P>to be more looked at, more thought of and attended to,



<P>than she had ever been before; and "Where is Fanny?"



<P>became no uncommon question, even without her being



<P>wanted for any one's convenience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Not only at home did her value increase, but at the



<P>Parsonage too.&nbsp; In that house, which she had hardly



<P>entered twice a year since Mr. Norris's death, she became



<P>a welcome, an invited guest, and in the gloom and dirt



<P>of a November day, most acceptable to Mary Crawford.



<P>Her visits there, beginning by chance, were continued



<P>by solicitation.&nbsp; Mrs. Grant, really eager to get any



<P>change for her sister, could, by the easiest self-deceit,



<P>persuade herself that she was doing the kindest thing



<P>by Fanny, and giving her the most important opportunities



<P>of improvement in pressing her frequent calls.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, having been sent into the village on some errand



<P>by her aunt Norris, was overtaken by a heavy shower close



<P>to the Parsonage; and being descried from one of the



<P>windows endeavouring to find shelter under the branches



<P>and lingering leaves of an oak just beyond their premises,



<P>was forced, though not without some modest reluctance on



<P>her part, to come in.&nbsp; A civil servant she had withstood;



<P>but when Dr. Grant himself went out with an umbrella,



<P>there was nothing to be done but to be very much ashamed,



<P>and to get into the house as fast as possible; and to poor



<P>Miss Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal



<P>rain in a very desponding state of mind, sighing over



<P>the ruin of all her plan of exercise for that morning,



<P>and of every chance of seeing a single creature beyond



<P>themselves for the next twenty-four hours, the sound of



<P>a little bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss



<P>Price dripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful.



<P>The value of an event on a wet day in the country was



<P>most forcibly brought before her.&nbsp; She was all alive



<P>again directly, and among the most active in being useful



<P>to Fanny, in detecting her to be wetter than she would at



<P>first allow, and providing her with dry clothes; and Fanny,



<P>after being obliged to submit to all this attention,



<P>and to being assisted and waited on by mistresses



<P>and maids, being also obliged, on returning downstairs,



<P>to be fixed in their drawing-room for an hour while



<P>the rain continued, the blessing of something fresh



<P>to see and think of was thus extended to Miss Crawford,



<P>and might carry on her spirits to the period of dressing



<P>and dinner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The two sisters were so kind to her, and so pleasant,



<P>that Fanny might have enjoyed her visit could she have



<P>believed herself not in the way, and could she have



<P>foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at the



<P>end of the hour, and save her from the shame of having



<P>Dr. Grant's carriage and horses out to take her home,



<P>with which she was threatened.&nbsp; As to anxiety for any alarm



<P>that her absence in such weather might occasion at home,



<P>she had nothing to suffer on that score; for as her being



<P>out was known only to her two aunts, she was perfectly



<P>aware that none would be felt, and that in whatever cottage



<P>aunt Norris might chuse to establish her during the rain,



<P>her being in such cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was beginning to look brighter, when Fanny,



<P>observing a harp in the room, asked some questions about it,



<P>which soon led to an acknowledgment of her wishing very



<P>much to hear it, and a confession, which could hardly



<P>be believed, of her having never yet heard it since its



<P>being in Mansfield.&nbsp; To Fanny herself it appeared a very



<P>simple and natural circumstance.&nbsp; She had scarcely ever



<P>been at the Parsonage since the instrument's arrival,



<P>there had been no reason that she should; but Miss Crawford,



<P>calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject,



<P>was concerned at her own neglect; and "Shall I play



<P>to you now?" and "What will you have?" were questions



<P>immediately following with the readiest good-humour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She played accordingly; happy to have a new listener,



<P>and a listener who seemed so much obliged, so full



<P>of wonder at the performance, and who shewed herself



<P>not wanting in taste.&nbsp; She played till Fanny's eyes,



<P>straying to the window on the weather's being evidently fair,



<P>spoke what she felt must be done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Another quarter of an hour," said Miss Crawford, "and we



<P>shall see how it will be.&nbsp; Do not run away the first



<P>moment of its holding up.&nbsp; Those clouds look alarming."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But they are passed over," said Fanny.&nbsp; "I have been



<P>watching them.&nbsp; This weather is all from the south."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"South or north, I know a black cloud when I see it;



<P>and you must not set forward while it is so threatening.



<P>And besides, I want to play something more to you--a very



<P>pretty piece--and your cousin Edmund's prime favourite.



<P>You must stay and hear your cousin's favourite."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny felt that she must; and though she had not



<P>waited for that sentence to be thinking of Edmund,



<P>such a memento made her particularly awake to his idea,



<P>and she fancied him sitting in that room again and again,



<P>perhaps in the very spot where she sat now, listening with



<P>constant delight to the favourite air, played, as it



<P>appeared to her, with superior tone and expression;



<P>and though pleased with it herself, and glad to like whatever



<P>was liked by him, she was more sincerely impatient to go



<P>away at the conclusion of it than she had been before;



<P>and on this being evident, she was so kindly asked to



<P>call again, to take them in her walk whenever she could,



<P>to come and hear more of the harp, that she felt it



<P>necessary to be done, if no objection arose at home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took



<P>place between them within the first fortnight after



<P>the Miss Bertrams' going away--an intimacy resulting



<P>principally from Miss Crawford's desire of something new,



<P>and which had little reality in Fanny's feelings.



<P>Fanny went to her every two or three days:&nbsp; it seemed a kind



<P>of fascination:&nbsp; she could not be easy without going,



<P>and yet it was without loving her, without ever thinking



<P>like her, without any sense of obligation for being



<P>sought after now when nobody else was to be had;



<P>and deriving no higher pleasure from her conversation



<P>than occasional amusement, and _that_ often at the expense



<P>of her judgment, when it was raised by pleasantry on



<P>people or subjects which she wished to be respected.



<P>She went, however, and they sauntered about together



<P>many an half-hour in Mrs. Grant's shrubbery, the weather



<P>being unusually mild for the time of year, and venturing



<P>sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches now



<P>comparatively unsheltered, remaining there perhaps till,



<P>in the midst of some tender ejaculation of Fanny's on



<P>the sweets of so protracted an autumn, they were forced,



<P>by the sudden swell of a cold gust shaking down the last few



<P>yellow leaves about them, to jump up and walk for warmth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is pretty, very pretty," said Fanny, looking around



<P>her as they were thus sitting together one day; "every time



<P>I come into this shrubbery I am more struck with its



<P>growth and beauty.&nbsp; Three years ago, this was nothing



<P>but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field,



<P>never thought of as anything, or capable of becoming anything;



<P>and now it is converted into a walk, and it would be



<P>difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience



<P>or an ornament; and perhaps, in another three years,



<P>we may be forgetting--almost forgetting what it was before.



<P>How wonderful, how very wonderful the operations of time,



<P>and the changes of the human mind!"&nbsp; And following



<P>the latter train of thought, she soon afterwards added:



<P>"If any one faculty of our nature may be called _more_



<P>wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory.



<P>There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible



<P>in the powers, the failures, the inequalities



<P>of memory, than in any other of our intelligences.



<P>The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable,



<P>so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak;



<P>and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control!



<P>We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers



<P>of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past



<P>finding out."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford, untouched and inattentive, had nothing



<P>to say; and Fanny, perceiving it, brought back her own



<P>mind to what she thought must interest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It may seem impertinent in _me_ to praise, but I must



<P>admire the taste Mrs. Grant has shewn in all this.



<P>There is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk!



<P>Not too much attempted!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," replied Miss Crawford carelessly, "it does



<P>very well for a place of this sort.&nbsp; One does not think



<P>of extent _here_; and between ourselves, till I came



<P>to Mansfield, I had not imagined a country parson



<P>ever aspired to a shrubbery, or anything of the kind."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive!" said Fanny,



<P>in reply.&nbsp; "My uncle's gardener always says the soil here



<P>is better than his own, and so it appears from the growth



<P>of the laurels and evergreens in general.&nbsp; The evergreen!



<P>How beautiful, how welcome, how wonderful the evergreen!



<P>When one thinks of it, how astonishing a variety of nature!



<P>In some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf



<P>is the variety, but that does not make it less amazing



<P>that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants



<P>differing in the first rule and law of their existence.



<P>You will think me rhapsodising; but when I am out of doors,



<P>especially when I am sitting out of doors, I am very apt



<P>to get into this sort of wondering strain.&nbsp; One cannot fix



<P>one's eyes on the commonest natural production without



<P>finding food for a rambling fancy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To say the truth," replied Miss Crawford, "I am something



<P>like the famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV.;



<P>and may declare that I see no wonder in this shrubbery



<P>equal to seeing myself in it.&nbsp; If anybody had told



<P>me a year ago that this place would be my home,



<P>that I should be spending month after month here, as I



<P>have done, I certainly should not have believed them.



<P>I have now been here nearly five months; and, moreover,



<P>the quietest five months I ever passed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_Too_ quiet for you, I believe."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should have thought so _theoretically_ myself, but,"



<P>and her eyes brightened as she spoke, "take it all



<P>and all, I never spent so happy a summer.&nbsp; But then,"



<P>with a more thoughtful air and lowered voice, "there is



<P>no saying what it may lead to."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's heart beat quick, and she felt quite unequal



<P>to surmising or soliciting anything more.&nbsp; Miss Crawford,



<P>however, with renewed animation, soon went on--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country



<P>residence than I had ever expected to be.&nbsp; I can even



<P>suppose it pleasant to spend _half_ the year in the country,



<P>under certain circumstances, very pleasant.&nbsp; An elegant,



<P>moderate-sized house in the centre of family connexions;



<P>continual engagements among them; commanding the first society



<P>in the neighbourhood; looked up to, perhaps, as leading



<P>it even more than those of larger fortune, and turning



<P>from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing



<P>worse than a _tete-a-tete_ with the person one feels



<P>most agreeable in the world.&nbsp; There is nothing frightful



<P>in such a picture, is there, Miss Price?&nbsp; One need not



<P>envy the new Mrs. Rushworth with such a home as _that_."



<P>"Envy Mrs. Rushworth!" was all that Fanny attempted to say.



<P>"Come, come, it would be very un-handsome in us to be



<P>severe on Mrs. Rushworth, for I look forward to our owing



<P>her a great many gay, brilliant, happy hours.&nbsp; I expect



<P>we shall be all very much at Sotherton another year.



<P>Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing;



<P>for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth's wife must be to



<P>fill her house, and give the best balls in the country."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was silent, and Miss Crawford relapsed into



<P>thoughtfulness, till suddenly looking up at the end



<P>of a few minutes, she exclaimed, "Ah! here he is."



<P>It was not Mr. Rushworth, however, but Edmund,



<P>who then appeared walking towards them with Mrs. Grant.



<P>"My sister and Mr. Bertram.&nbsp; I am so glad your eldest



<P>cousin is gone, that he may be Mr. Bertram again.&nbsp; There is



<P>something in the sound of Mr. _Edmund_ Bertram so formal,



<P>so pitiful, so younger-brother-like, that I detest it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How differently we feel!" cried Fanny.&nbsp; "To me,



<P>the sound of _Mr._ Bertram is so cold and nothing-meaning,



<P>so entirely without warmth or character!&nbsp; It just stands



<P>for a gentleman, and that's all.&nbsp; But there is nobleness



<P>in the name of Edmund.&nbsp; It is a name of heroism and renown;



<P>of kings, princes, and knights; and seems to breathe



<P>the spirit of chivalry and warm affections."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I grant you the name is good in itself, and _Lord_ Edmund



<P>or _Sir_ Edmund sound delightfully; but sink it under the chill,



<P>the annihilation of a Mr., and Mr. Edmund is no more than



<P>Mr. John or Mr. Thomas.&nbsp; Well, shall we join and disappoint



<P>them of half their lecture upon sitting down out of doors



<P>at this time of year, by being up before they can begin?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund met them with particular pleasure.&nbsp; It was the



<P>first time of his seeing them together since the beginning



<P>of that better acquaintance which he had been hearing



<P>of with great satisfaction.&nbsp; A friendship between two so



<P>very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished:



<P>and to the credit of the lover's understanding, be it stated,



<P>that he did not by any means consider Fanny as the only,



<P>or even as the greater gainer by such a friendship.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said Miss Crawford, "and do you not scold us for



<P>our imprudence?&nbsp; What do you think we have been sitting



<P>down for but to be talked to about it, and entreated



<P>and supplicated never to do so again?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps I might have scolded," said Edmund, "if either



<P>of you had been sitting down alone; but while you



<P>do wrong together, I can overlook a great deal."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They cannot have been sitting long," cried Mrs. Grant,



<P>"for when I went up for my shawl I saw them from the



<P>staircase window, and then they were walking."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And really," added Edmund, "the day is so mild,



<P>that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly



<P>thought imprudent.&nbsp; Our weather must not always be judged



<P>by the calendar.&nbsp; We may sometimes take greater liberties



<P>in November than in May."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word," cried Miss Crawford, "you are two of the most



<P>disappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with!



<P>There is no giving you a moment's uneasiness.&nbsp; You do not



<P>know how much we have been suffering, nor what chills



<P>we have felt!&nbsp; But I have long thought Mr. Bertram one



<P>of the worst subjects to work on, in any little manoeuvre



<P>against common sense, that a woman could be plagued with.



<P>I had very little hope of _him_ from the first; but you,



<P>Mrs. Grant, my sister, my own sister, I think I had a right



<P>to alarm you a little."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do not flatter yourself, my dearest Mary.&nbsp; You have not



<P>the smallest chance of moving me.&nbsp; I have my alarms,



<P>but they are quite in a different quarter; and if I could



<P>have altered the weather, you would have had a good sharp



<P>east wind blowing on you the whole time--for here are



<P>some of my plants which Robert _will_ leave out because



<P>the nights are so mild, and I know the end of it will be,



<P>that we shall have a sudden change of weather, a hard frost



<P>setting in all at once, taking everybody (at least Robert)



<P>by surprise, and I shall lose every one; and what is worse,



<P>cook has just been telling me that the turkey, which I



<P>particularly wished not to be dressed till Sunday,



<P>because I know how much more Dr. Grant would enjoy it



<P>on Sunday after the fatigues of the day, will not keep



<P>beyond to-morrow. These are something like grievances,



<P>and make me think the weather most unseasonably close."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The sweets of housekeeping in a country village!"



<P>said Miss Crawford archly.&nbsp; "Commend me to the nurseryman



<P>and the poulterer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear child, commend Dr. Grant to the deanery



<P>of Westminster or St. Paul's, and I should be as glad



<P>of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be.&nbsp; But we



<P>have no such people in Mansfield.&nbsp; What would you have me do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! you can do nothing but what you do already:



<P>be plagued very often, and never lose your temper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you; but there is no escaping these little vexations,



<P>Mary, live where we may; and when you are settled in town



<P>and I come to see you, I dare say I shall find you



<P>with yours, in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer,



<P>perhaps on their very account.&nbsp; Their remoteness



<P>and unpunctuality, or their exorbitant charges and frauds,



<P>will be drawing forth bitter lamentations."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything



<P>of the sort.&nbsp; A large income is the best recipe for



<P>happiness I ever heard of.&nbsp; It certainly may secure



<P>all the myrtle and turkey part of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You intend to be very rich?" said Edmund, with a look which,



<P>to Fanny's eye, had a great deal of serious meaning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure.&nbsp; Do not you?&nbsp; Do not we all?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot intend anything which it must be so completely



<P>beyond my power to command.&nbsp; Miss Crawford may chuse her



<P>degree of wealth.&nbsp; She has only to fix on her number of



<P>thousands a year, and there can be no doubt of their coming.



<P>My intentions are only not to be poor."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By moderation and economy, and bringing down your wants



<P>to your income, and all that.&nbsp; I understand you--and a



<P>very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life,



<P>with such limited means and indifferent connexions.



<P>What can _you_ want but a decent maintenance?&nbsp; You have



<P>not much time before you; and your relations are in no



<P>situation to do anything for you, or to mortify you



<P>by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence.



<P>Be honest and poor, by all means--but I shall not



<P>envy you; I do not much think I shall even respect you.



<P>I have a much greater respect for those that are honest



<P>and rich."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your degree of respect for honesty, rich or poor,



<P>is precisely what I have no manner of concern with.



<P>I do not mean to be poor.&nbsp; Poverty is exactly what I have



<P>determined against.&nbsp; Honesty, in the something between,



<P>in the middle state of worldly circumstances, is all that I



<P>am anxious for your not looking down on."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But I do look down upon it, if it might have been higher.



<P>I must look down upon anything contented with obscurity



<P>when it might rise to distinction."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But how may it rise?&nbsp; How may my honesty at least rise



<P>to any distinction?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was not so very easy a question to answer,



<P>and occasioned an "Oh!" of some length from the fair lady



<P>before she could add, "You ought to be in parliament,



<P>or you should have gone into the army ten years ago."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_That_ is not much to the purpose now; and as to my being



<P>in parliament, I believe I must wait till there is an



<P>especial assembly for the representation of younger sons



<P>who have little to live on.&nbsp; No, Miss Crawford," he added,



<P>in a more serious tone, "there _are_ distinctions which I



<P>should be miserable if I thought myself without any chance--



<P>absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining--



<P>but they are of a different character."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A look of consciousness as he spoke, and what seemed



<P>a consciousness of manner on Miss Crawford's side



<P>as she made some laughing answer, was sorrowfull food



<P>for Fanny's observation; and finding herself quite



<P>unable to attend as she ought to Mrs. Grant, by whose



<P>side she was now following the others, she had nearly



<P>resolved on going home immediately, and only waited



<P>for courage to say so, when the sound of the great clock



<P>at Mansfield Park, striking three, made her feel that she



<P>had really been much longer absent than usual, and brought



<P>the previous self-inquiry of whether she should take



<P>leave or not just then, and how, to a very speedy issue.



<P>With undoubting decision she directly began her adieus;



<P>and Edmund began at the same time to recollect that



<P>his mother had been inquiring for her, and that he



<P>had walked down to the Parsonage on purpose to bring her back.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's hurry increased; and without in the least expecting



<P>Edmund's attendance, she would have hastened away alone;



<P>but the general pace was quickened, and they all accompanied



<P>her into the house, through which it was necessary to pass.



<P>Dr. Grant was in the vestibule, and as they stopt to



<P>speak to him she found, from Edmund's manner, that he



<P>_did_ mean to go with her.&nbsp; He too was taking leave.



<P>She could not but be thankful.&nbsp; In the moment of parting,



<P>Edmund was invited by Dr. Grant to eat his mutton



<P>with him the next day; and Fanny had barely time for an



<P>unpleasant feeling on the occasion, when Mrs. Grant,



<P>with sudden recollection, turned to her and asked for the



<P>pleasure of her company too.&nbsp; This was so new an attention,



<P>so perfectly new a circumstance in the events of



<P>Fanny's life, that she was all surprise and embarrassment;



<P>and while stammering out her great obligation, and her



<P>"but she did not suppose it would be in her power,"



<P>was looking at Edmund for his opinion and help.&nbsp; But Edmund,



<P>delighted with her having such an happiness offered,



<P>and ascertaining with half a look, and half a sentence,



<P>that she had no objection but on her aunt's account,



<P>could not imagine that his mother would make any difficulty



<P>of sparing her, and therefore gave his decided open advice



<P>that the invitation should be accepted; and though Fanny



<P>would not venture, even on his encouragement, to such



<P>a flight of audacious independence, it was soon settled,



<P>that if nothing were heard to the contrary, Mrs. Grant



<P>might expect her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And you know what your dinner will be,"



<P>said Mrs. Grant, smiling--"the turkey, and I assure you



<P>a very fine one; for, my dear," turning to her husband,



<P>"cook insists upon the turkey's being dressed to-morrow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well, very well," cried Dr. Grant, "all the better;



<P>I am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house.



<P>But Miss Price and Mr. Edmund Bertram, I dare say, would take



<P>their chance.&nbsp; We none of us want to hear the bill of fare.



<P>A friendly meeting, and not a fine dinner, is all we



<P>have in view.&nbsp; A turkey, or a goose, or a leg of mutton,



<P>or whatever you and your cook chuse to give us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The two cousins walked home together; and, except in the



<P>immediate discussion of this engagement, which Edmund



<P>spoke of with the warmest satisfaction, as so particularly



<P>desirable for her in the intimacy which he saw with



<P>so much pleasure established, it was a silent walk;



<P>for having finished that subject, he grew thoughtful



<P>and indisposed for any other.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Edmund now believed himself perfectly acquainted with all



<P>that Fanny could tell, or could leave to be conjectured



<P>of her sentiments, and he was satisfied.&nbsp; It had been,



<P>as he before presumed, too hasty a measure on Crawford's side,



<P>and time must be given to make the idea first familiar,



<P>and then agreeable to her.&nbsp; She must be used to the



<P>consideration of his being in love with her, and then



<P>a return of affection might not be very distant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He gave this opinion as the result of the conversation



<P>to his father; and recommended there being nothing more said



<P>to her:&nbsp; no farther attempts to influence or persuade;



<P>but that everything should be left to Crawford's assiduities,



<P>and the natural workings of her own mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas promised that it should be so.&nbsp; Edmund's account



<P>of Fanny's disposition he could believe to be just;



<P>he supposed she had all those feelings, but he must consider



<P>it as very unfortunate that she _had_; for, less willing



<P>than his son to trust to the future, he could not help



<P>fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit



<P>were necessary for her, she might not have persuaded



<P>herself into receiving his addresses properly before



<P>the young man's inclination for paying them were over.



<P>There was nothing to be done, however, but to submit



<P>quietly and hope the best.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The promised visit from "her friend," as Edmund called



<P>Miss Crawford, was a formidable threat to Fanny,



<P>and she lived in continual terror of it.&nbsp; As a sister,



<P>so partial and so angry, and so little scrupulous of what



<P>she said, and in another light so triumphant and secure,



<P>she was in every way an object of painful alarm.



<P>Her displeasure, her penetration, and her happiness were



<P>all fearful to encounter; and the dependence of having



<P>others present when they met was Fanny's only support



<P>in looking forward to it.&nbsp; She absented herself as little



<P>as possible from Lady Bertram, kept away from the East room,



<P>and took no solitary walk in the shrubbery, in her caution



<P>to avoid any sudden attack.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She succeeded.&nbsp; She was safe in the breakfast-room, with her aunt,



<P>when Miss Crawford did come; and the first misery over,



<P>and Miss Crawford looking and speaking with much less



<P>particularity of expression than she had anticipated,



<P>Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse



<P>to be endured than a half-hour of moderate agitation.



<P>But here she hoped too much; Miss Crawford was not the slave



<P>of opportunity.&nbsp; She was determined to see Fanny alone,



<P>and therefore said to her tolerably soon, in a low voice,



<P>"I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere";



<P>words that Fanny felt all over her, in all her pulses



<P>and all her nerves.&nbsp; Denial was impossible.&nbsp; Her habits



<P>of ready submission, on the contrary, made her almost



<P>instantly rise and lead the way out of the room.



<P>She did it with wretched feelings, but it was inevitable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were no sooner in the hall than all restraint



<P>of countenance was over on Miss Crawford's side.



<P>She immediately shook her head at Fanny with arch,



<P>yet affectionate reproach, and taking her hand,



<P>seemed hardly able to help beginning directly.



<P>She said nothing, however, but, "Sad, sad girl!



<P>I do not know when I shall have done scolding you,"



<P>and had discretion enough to reserve the rest till they



<P>might be secure of having four walls to themselves.



<P>Fanny naturally turned upstairs, and took her guest to the



<P>apartment which was now always fit for comfortable use;



<P>opening the door, however, with a most aching heart,



<P>and feeling that she had a more distressing scene before



<P>her than ever that spot had yet witnessed.&nbsp; But the evil



<P>ready to burst on her was at least delayed by the sudden



<P>change in Miss Crawford's ideas; by the strong effect



<P>on her mind which the finding herself in the East room



<P>again produced.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ha!" she cried, with instant animation, "am I here again?



<P>The East room!&nbsp; Once only was I in this room before";



<P>and after stopping to look about her, and seemingly



<P>to retrace all that had then passed, she added, "Once



<P>only before.&nbsp; Do you remember it?&nbsp; I came to rehearse.



<P>Your cousin came too; and we had a rehearsal.&nbsp; You were



<P>our audience and prompter.&nbsp; A delightful rehearsal.



<P>I shall never forget it.&nbsp; Here we were, just in this



<P>part of the room:&nbsp; here was your cousin, here was I,



<P>here were the chairs.&nbsp; Oh! why will such things ever



<P>pass away?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Happily for her companion, she wanted no answer.



<P>Her mind was entirely self-engrossed. She was in a reverie



<P>of sweet remembrances.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable!



<P>The subject of it so very--very--what shall I say?



<P>He was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me.



<P>I think I see him now, trying to be as demure and composed



<P>as Anhalt ought, through the two long speeches.



<P>'When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state,



<P>matrimony may be called a happy life.'&nbsp; I suppose no time



<P>can ever wear out the impression I have of his looks



<P>and voice as he said those words.&nbsp; It was curious,



<P>very curious, that we should have such a scene to play!



<P>If I had the power of recalling any one week of my existence,



<P>it should be that week--that acting week.&nbsp; Say what



<P>you would, Fanny, it should be _that_; for I never knew



<P>such exquisite happiness in any other.&nbsp; His sturdy spirit



<P>to bend as it did!&nbsp; Oh! it was sweet beyond expression.



<P>But alas, that very evening destroyed it all.&nbsp; That very



<P>evening brought your most unwelcome uncle.&nbsp; Poor Sir Thomas,



<P>who was glad to see you?&nbsp; Yet, Fanny, do not imagine I would



<P>now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas, though I certainly



<P>did hate him for many a week.&nbsp; No, I do him justice now.



<P>He is just what the head of such a family should be.



<P>Nay, in sober sadness, I believe I now love you all."



<P>And having said so, with a degree of tenderness and



<P>consciousness which Fanny had never seen in her before,



<P>and now thought only too becoming, she turned away



<P>for a moment to recover herself.&nbsp; "I have had a little



<P>fit since I came into this room, as you may perceive,"



<P>said she presently, with a playful smile, "but it is



<P>over now; so let us sit down and be comfortable; for as to



<P>scolding you, Fanny, which I came fully intending to do,



<P>I have not the heart for it when it comes to the point."



<P>And embracing her very affectionately, "Good, gentle Fanny!



<P>when I think of this being the last time of seeing you for I



<P>do not know how long, I feel it quite impossible to do anything



<P>but love you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was affected.&nbsp; She had not foreseen anything of this,



<P>and her feelings could seldom withstand the melancholy



<P>influence of the word "last."&nbsp; She cried as if she



<P>had loved Miss Crawford more than she possibly could;



<P>and Miss Crawford, yet farther softened by the sight



<P>of such emotion, hung about her with fondness, and said,



<P>"I hate to leave you.&nbsp; I shall see no one half so amiable



<P>where I am going.&nbsp; Who says we shall not be sisters?



<P>I know we shall.&nbsp; I feel that we are born to be connected;



<P>and those tears convince me that you feel it too,



<P>dear Fanny."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny roused herself, and replying only in part, said,



<P>"But you are only going from one set of friends to another.



<P>You are going to a very particular friend."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, very true.&nbsp; Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend



<P>for years.&nbsp; But I have not the least inclination to go



<P>near her.&nbsp; I can think only of the friends I am leaving:



<P>my excellent sister, yourself, and the Bertrams in general.



<P>You have all so much more _heart_ among you than one



<P>finds in the world at large.&nbsp; You all give me a feeling



<P>of being able to trust and confide in you, which in common



<P>intercourse one knows nothing of.&nbsp; I wish I had settled



<P>with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till after Easter, a much



<P>better time for the visit, but now I cannot put her off.



<P>And when I have done with her I must go to her sister,



<P>Lady Stornaway, because _she_ was rather my most particular



<P>friend of the two, but I have not cared much for _her_



<P>these three years."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After this speech the two girls sat many minutes silent,



<P>each thoughtful:&nbsp; Fanny meditating on the different sorts



<P>of friendship in the world, Mary on something of less



<P>philosophic tendency.&nbsp; _She_ first spoke again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How perfectly I remember my resolving to look for



<P>you upstairs, and setting off to find my way to the



<P>East room, without having an idea whereabouts it was!



<P>How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came along,



<P>and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this



<P>table at work; and then your cousin's astonishment,



<P>when he opened the door, at seeing me here!&nbsp; To be sure,



<P>your uncle's returning that very evening!&nbsp; There never



<P>was anything quite like it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another short fit of abstraction followed, when,



<P>shaking it off, she thus attacked her companion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, Fanny, you are absolutely in a reverie.



<P>Thinking, I hope, of one who is always thinking of you.



<P>Oh! that I could transport you for a short time into



<P>our circle in town, that you might understand how your



<P>power over Henry is thought of there!&nbsp; Oh! the envyings



<P>and heartburnings of dozens and dozens; the wonder,



<P>the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you



<P>have done!&nbsp; For as to secrecy, Henry is quite the hero



<P>of an old romance, and glories in his chains.&nbsp; You should



<P>come to London to know how to estimate your conquest.



<P>If you were to see how he is courted, and how I am courted



<P>for his sake!&nbsp; Now, I am well aware that I shall not be



<P>half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his



<P>situation with you.&nbsp; When she comes to know the truth



<P>she will, very likely, wish me in Northamptonshire again;



<P>for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser, by a first wife,



<P>whom she is wild to get married, and wants Henry to take.



<P>Oh! she has been trying for him to such a degree.



<P>Innocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an



<P>idea of the _sensation_ that you will be occasioning,



<P>of the curiosity there will be to see you, of the endless



<P>questions I shall have to answer!&nbsp; Poor Margaret Fraser



<P>will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth,



<P>and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes.



<P>I wish Margaret were married, for my poor friend's sake,



<P>for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most



<P>other married people.&nbsp; And yet it was a most desirable



<P>match for Janet at the time.&nbsp; We were all delighted.



<P>She could not do otherwise than accept him, for he was rich,



<P>and she had nothing; but he turns out ill-tempered



<P>and _exigeant_, and wants a young woman, a beautiful young



<P>woman of five-and-twenty, to be as steady as himself.



<P>And my friend does not manage him well; she does not seem



<P>to know how to make the best of it.&nbsp; There is a spirit



<P>of irritation which, to say nothing worse, is certainly



<P>very ill-bred. In their house I shall call to mind the



<P>conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect.



<P>Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister,



<P>and a certain consideration for her judgment, which makes



<P>one feel there _is_ attachment; but of that I shall



<P>see nothing with the Frasers.&nbsp; I shall be at Mansfield



<P>for ever, Fanny.&nbsp; My own sister as a wife, Sir Thomas



<P>Bertram as a husband, are my standards of perfection.



<P>Poor Janet has been sadly taken in, and yet there was



<P>nothing improper on her side:&nbsp; she did not run into the



<P>match inconsiderately; there was no want of foresight.



<P>She took three days to consider of his proposals,



<P>and during those three days asked the advice of everybody



<P>connected with her whose opinion was worth having,



<P>and especially applied to my late dear aunt, whose



<P>knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally



<P>and deservedly looked up to by all the young people



<P>of her acquaintance, and she was decidedly in favour



<P>of Mr. Fraser.&nbsp; This seems as if nothing were a security



<P>for matrimonial comfort.&nbsp; I have not so much to say



<P>for my friend Flora, who jilted a very nice young man



<P>in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway,



<P>who has about as much sense, Fanny, as Mr. Rushworth,



<P>but much worse-looking, and with a blackguard character.



<P>I _had_ my doubts at the time about her being right,



<P>for he has not even the air of a gentleman, and now I am



<P>sure she was wrong.&nbsp; By the bye, Flora Ross was dying



<P>for Henry the first winter she came out.&nbsp; But were I



<P>to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have



<P>known to be in love with him, I should never have done.



<P>It is you, only you, insensible Fanny, who can think



<P>of him with anything like indifference.&nbsp; But are you



<P>so insensible as you profess yourself?&nbsp; No, no, I see you



<P>are not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was, indeed, so deep a blush over Fanny's face



<P>at that moment as might warrant strong suspicion



<P>in a predisposed mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Excellent creature!&nbsp; I will not tease you.&nbsp; Everything shall



<P>take its course.&nbsp; But, dear Fanny, you must allow that you



<P>were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked



<P>as your cousin fancies.&nbsp; It is not possible but that you



<P>must have had some thoughts on the subject, some surmises



<P>as to what might be.&nbsp; You must have seen that he was



<P>trying to please you by every attention in his power.



<P>Was not he devoted to you at the ball?&nbsp; And then before



<P>the ball, the necklace!&nbsp; Oh! you received it just as it



<P>was meant.&nbsp; You were as conscious as heart could desire.



<P>I remember it perfectly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you mean, then, that your brother knew of the



<P>necklace beforehand?&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Miss Crawford, _that_ was not fair."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Knew of it!&nbsp; It was his own doing entirely, his own thought.



<P>I am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head,



<P>but I was delighted to act on his proposal for both



<P>your sakes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will not say," replied Fanny, "that I was not half



<P>afraid at the time of its being so, for there was something



<P>in your look that frightened me, but not at first;



<P>I was as unsuspicious of it at first--indeed, indeed I was.



<P>It is as true as that I sit here.&nbsp; And had I had an idea of it,



<P>nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace.



<P>As to your brother's behaviour, certainly I was sensible of



<P>a particularity:&nbsp; I had been sensible of it some little time,



<P>perhaps two or three weeks; but then I considered it as



<P>meaning nothing:&nbsp; I put it down as simply being his way,



<P>and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have



<P>any serious thoughts of me.&nbsp; I had not, Miss Crawford,



<P>been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him



<P>and some part of this family in the summer and autumn.



<P>I was quiet, but I was not blind.&nbsp; I could not but see



<P>that Mr. Crawford allowed himself in gallantries which did



<P>mean nothing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!&nbsp; I cannot deny it.&nbsp; He has now and then been a sad flirt,



<P>and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in



<P>young ladies' affections.&nbsp; I have often scolded him for it,



<P>but it is his only fault; and there is this to be said,



<P>that very few young ladies have any affections worth



<P>caring for.&nbsp; And then, Fanny, the glory of fixing one



<P>who has been shot at by so many; of having it in one's



<P>power to pay off the debts of one's sex!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I am sure



<P>it is not in woman's nature to refuse such a triumph."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny shook her head.&nbsp; "I cannot think well of a man



<P>who sports with any woman's feelings; and there may often



<P>be a great deal more suffered than a stander-by can judge of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not defend him.&nbsp; I leave him entirely to your mercy,



<P>and when he has got you at Everingham, I do not care how much



<P>you lecture him.&nbsp; But this I will say, that his fault,



<P>the liking to make girls a little in love with him, is not



<P>half so dangerous to a wife's happiness as a tendency to fall



<P>in love himself, which he has never been addicted to.



<P>And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached



<P>to you in a way that he never was to any woman before;



<P>that he loves you with all his heart, and will love you



<P>as nearly for ever as possible.&nbsp; If any man ever loved



<P>a woman for ever, I think Henry will do as much for you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny could not avoid a faint smile, but had nothing



<P>to say.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot imagine Henry ever to have been happier,"



<P>continued Mary presently, "than when he had succeeded



<P>in getting your brother's commission."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had made a sure push at Fanny's feelings here.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes.&nbsp; How very, very kind of him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know he must have exerted himself very much, for I know



<P>the parties he had to move.&nbsp; The Admiral hates trouble,



<P>and scorns asking favours; and there are so many



<P>young men's claims to be attended to in the same way,



<P>that a friendship and energy, not very determined,



<P>is easily put by.&nbsp; What a happy creature William must be!



<P>I wish we could see him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor Fanny's mind was thrown into the most distressing



<P>of all its varieties.&nbsp; The recollection of what had



<P>been done for William was always the most powerful



<P>disturber of every decision against Mr. Crawford;



<P>and she sat thinking deeply of it till Mary, who had been



<P>first watching her complacently, and then musing on



<P>something else, suddenly called her attention by saying:



<P>"I should like to sit talking with you here all day,



<P>but we must not forget the ladies below, and so good-bye,



<P>my dear, my amiable, my excellent Fanny, for though we



<P>shall nominally part in the breakfast-parlour, I must



<P>take leave of you here.&nbsp; And I do take leave, longing for



<P>a happy reunion, and trusting that when we meet again,



<P>it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts



<P>to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A very, very kind embrace, and some agitation of manner,



<P>accompanied these words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall see your cousin in town soon:&nbsp; he talks of



<P>being there tolerably soon; and Sir Thomas, I dare say,



<P>in the course of the spring; and your eldest cousin,



<P>and the Rushworths, and Julia, I am sure of meeting again



<P>and again, and all but you.&nbsp; I have two favours to ask,



<P>Fanny:&nbsp; one is your correspondence.&nbsp; You must write to me.



<P>And the other, that you will often call on Mrs. Grant,



<P>and make her amends for my being gone."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The first, at least, of these favours Fanny would rather



<P>not have been asked; but it was impossible for her to refuse



<P>the correspondence; it was impossible for her even not to



<P>accede to it more readily than her own judgment authorised.



<P>There was no resisting so much apparent affection.



<P>Her disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fond



<P>treatment, and from having hitherto known so little of it,



<P>she was the more overcome by Miss Crawford's. Besides,



<P>there was gratitude towards her, for having made their



<P>_tete-a-tete_ so much less painful than her fears had predicted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was over, and she had escaped without reproaches



<P>and without detection.&nbsp; Her secret was still her own;



<P>and while that was the case, she thought she could resign



<P>herself to almost everything.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the evening there was another parting.&nbsp; Henry Crawford



<P>came and sat some time with them; and her spirits not being



<P>previously in the strongest state, her heart was softened



<P>for a while towards him, because he really seemed to feel.



<P>Quite unlike his usual self, he scarcely said anything.



<P>He was evidently oppressed, and Fanny must grieve for him,



<P>though hoping she might never see him again till he were the



<P>husband of some other woman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When it came to the moment of parting, he would take her hand,



<P>he would not be denied it; he said nothing, however,



<P>or nothing that she heard, and when he had left the room,



<P>she was better pleased that such a token of friendship



<P>had passed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the morrow the Crawfords were gone.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Edmund's first object the next morning was to see his



<P>father alone, and give him a fair statement of the whole



<P>acting scheme, defending his own share in it as far only



<P>as he could then, in a soberer moment, feel his motives



<P>to deserve, and acknowledging, with perfect ingenuousness,



<P>that his concession had been attended with such partial



<P>good as to make his judgment in it very doubtful.



<P>He was anxious, while vindicating himself, to say nothing



<P>unkind of the others:&nbsp; but there was only one amongst them



<P>whose conduct he could mention without some necessity



<P>of defence or palliation.&nbsp; "We have all been more or less



<P>to blame," said he, "every one of us, excepting Fanny.



<P>Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout;



<P>who has been consistent.&nbsp; _Her_ feelings have been steadily



<P>against it from first to last.&nbsp; She never ceased to think



<P>of what was due to you.&nbsp; You will find Fanny everything you



<P>could wish."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among



<P>such a party, and at such a time, as strongly as his son



<P>had ever supposed he must; he felt it too much, indeed,



<P>for many words; and having shaken hands with Edmund,



<P>meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression,



<P>and forget how much he had been forgotten himself as soon



<P>as he could, after the house had been cleared of every



<P>object enforcing the remembrance, and restored to its



<P>proper state.&nbsp; He did not enter into any remonstrance with



<P>his other children:&nbsp; he was more willing to believe they



<P>felt their error than to run the risk of investigation.



<P>The reproof of an immediate conclusion of everything,



<P>the sweep of every preparation, would be sufficient.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was one person, however, in the house, whom he could



<P>not leave to learn his sentiments merely through his conduct.



<P>He could not help giving Mrs. Norris a hint of his having



<P>hoped that her advice might have been interposed to prevent



<P>what her judgment must certainly have disapproved.&nbsp; The young



<P>people had been very inconsiderate in forming the plan;



<P>they ought to have been capable of a better decision themselves;



<P>but they were young; and, excepting Edmund, he believed,



<P>of unsteady characters; and with greater surprise, therefore,



<P>he must regard her acquiescence in their wrong measures,



<P>her countenance of their unsafe amusements, than that such



<P>measures and such amusements should have been suggested.



<P>Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as nearly being



<P>silenced as ever she had been in her life; for she



<P>was ashamed to confess having never seen any of the



<P>impropriety which was so glaring to Sir Thomas, and would



<P>not have admitted that her influence was insufficient--



<P>that she might have talked in vain.&nbsp; Her only resource



<P>was to get out of the subject as fast as possible, and turn



<P>the current of Sir Thomas's ideas into a happier channel.



<P>She had a great deal to insinuate in her own praise



<P>as to _general_ attention to the interest and comfort



<P>of his family, much exertion and many sacrifices to glance



<P>at in the form of hurried walks and sudden removals from



<P>her own fireside, and many excellent hints of distrust



<P>and economy to Lady Bertram and Edmund to detail,



<P>whereby a most considerable saving had always arisen,



<P>and more than one bad servant been detected.&nbsp; But her chief



<P>strength lay in Sotherton.&nbsp; Her greatest support and glory



<P>was in having formed the connexion with the Rushworths.



<P>_There_ she was impregnable.&nbsp; She took to herself all



<P>the credit of bringing Mr. Rushworth's admiration of Maria



<P>to any effect.&nbsp; "If I had not been active," said she,



<P>"and made a point of being introduced to his mother,



<P>and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit,



<P>I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have



<P>come of it; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable



<P>modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement,



<P>and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we



<P>had been idle.&nbsp; But I left no stone unturned.&nbsp; I was



<P>ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister,



<P>and at last I did persuade her.&nbsp; You know the distance



<P>to Sotherton; it was in the middle of winter, and the roads



<P>almost impassable, but I did persuade her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know how great, how justly great, your influence



<P>is with Lady Bertram and her children, and am the more



<P>concerned that it should not have been."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Sir Thomas, if you had seen the state of the



<P>roads _that_ day!&nbsp; I thought we should never have got



<P>through them, though we had the four horses of course;



<P>and poor old coachman would attend us, out of his great love



<P>and kindness, though he was hardly able to sit the box



<P>on account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring



<P>him for ever since Michaelmas.&nbsp; I cured him at last;



<P>but he was very bad all the winter--and this was such a day,



<P>I could not help going to him up in his room before we set



<P>off to advise him not to venture:&nbsp; he was putting on his wig;



<P>so I said, 'Coachman, you had much better not go; your Lady



<P>and I shall be very safe; you know how steady Stephen is,



<P>and Charles has been upon the leaders so often now,



<P>that I am sure there is no fear.'&nbsp; But, however, I soon



<P>found it would not do; he was bent upon going, and as I



<P>hate to be worrying and officious, I said no more; but my



<P>heart quite ached for him at every jolt, and when we got



<P>into the rough lanes about Stoke, where, what with frost



<P>and snow upon beds of stones, it was worse than anything



<P>you can imagine, I was quite in an agony about him.



<P>And then the poor horses too!&nbsp; To see them straining away!



<P>You know how I always feel for the horses.&nbsp; And when we got



<P>to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill, what do you think I did?



<P>You will laugh at me; but I got out and walked up.



<P>I did indeed.&nbsp; It might not be saving them much, but it



<P>was something, and I could not bear to sit at my ease



<P>and be dragged up at the expense of those noble animals.



<P>I caught a dreadful cold, but _that_ I did not regard.



<P>My object was accomplished in the visit."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth



<P>any trouble that might be taken to establish it.



<P>There is nothing very striking in Mr. Rushworth's manners,



<P>but I was pleased last night with what appeared to be his



<P>opinion on one subject:&nbsp; his decided preference of a quiet



<P>family party to the bustle and confusion of acting.



<P>He seemed to feel exactly as one could wish."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, indeed, and the more you know of him the better



<P>you will like him.&nbsp; He is not a shining character,



<P>but he has a thousand good qualities; and is so disposed



<P>to look up to you, that I am quite laughed at about it,



<P>for everybody considers it as my doing.&nbsp; 'Upon my word,



<P>Mrs. Norris,' said Mrs. Grant the other day, 'if Mr. Rushworth



<P>were a son of your own, he could not hold Sir Thomas



<P>in greater respect.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas gave up the point, foiled by her evasions,



<P>disarmed by her flattery; and was obliged to rest



<P>satisfied with the conviction that where the present



<P>pleasure of those she loved was at stake, her kindness



<P>did sometimes overpower her judgment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a busy morning with him.&nbsp; Conversation with any



<P>of them occupied but a small part of it.&nbsp; He had to



<P>reinstate himself in all the wonted concerns of his



<P>Mansfield life:&nbsp; to see his steward and his bailiff;



<P>to examine and compute, and, in the intervals



<P>of business, to walk into his stables and his gardens,



<P>and nearest plantations; but active and methodical,



<P>he had not only done all this before he resumed his seat



<P>as master of the house at dinner, he had also set the



<P>carpenter to work in pulling down what had been so lately



<P>put up in the billiard-room, and given the scene-painter



<P>his dismissal long enough to justify the pleasing belief



<P>of his being then at least as far off as Northampton.



<P>The scene-painter was gone, having spoilt only the



<P>floor of one room, ruined all the coachman's sponges,



<P>and made five of the under-servants idle and dissatisfied;



<P>and Sir Thomas was in hopes that another day or two would



<P>suffice to wipe away every outward memento of what had been,



<P>even to the destruction of every unbound copy of Lovers'



<P>Vows in the house, for he was burning all that met his eye

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Yates was beginning now to understand Sir Thomas's intentions,



<P>though as far as ever from understanding their source.



<P>He and his friend had been out with their guns the chief of



<P>the morning, and Tom had taken the opportunity of explaining,



<P>with proper apologies for his father's particularity,



<P>what was to be expected.&nbsp; Mr. Yates felt it as acutely



<P>as might be supposed.&nbsp; To be a second time disappointed



<P>in the same way was an instance of very severe ill-luck;



<P>and his indignation was such, that had it not been for delicacy



<P>towards his friend, and his friend's youngest sister,



<P>he believed he should certainly attack the baronet on



<P>the absurdity of his proceedings, and argue him into a



<P>little more rationality.&nbsp; He believed this very stoutly



<P>while he was in Mansfield Wood, and all the way home;



<P>but there was a something in Sir Thomas, when they sat



<P>round the same table, which made Mr. Yates think it wiser



<P>to let him pursue his own way, and feel the folly of it



<P>without opposition.&nbsp; He had known many disagreeable



<P>fathers before, and often been struck with the inconveniences



<P>they occasioned, but never, in the whole course of his life,



<P>had he seen one of that class so unintelligibly moral,



<P>so infamously tyrannical as Sir Thomas.&nbsp; He was not a man



<P>to be endured but for his children's sake, and he might



<P>be thankful to his fair daughter Julia that Mr. Yates



<P>did yet mean to stay a few days longer under his roof.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The evening passed with external smoothness, though almost



<P>every mind was ruffled; and the music which Sir Thomas



<P>called for from his daughters helped to conceal the want



<P>of real harmony.&nbsp; Maria was in a good deal of agitation.



<P>It was of the utmost consequence to her that Crawford



<P>should now lose no time in declaring himself, and she



<P>was disturbed that even a day should be gone by without



<P>seeming to advance that point.&nbsp; She had been expecting



<P>to see him the whole morning, and all the evening, too,



<P>was still expecting him.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth had set off early



<P>with the great news for Sotherton; and she had fondly hoped



<P>for such an immediate _eclaircissement_ as might save him



<P>the trouble of ever coming back again.&nbsp; But they had seen



<P>no one from the Parsonage, not a creature, and had heard



<P>no tidings beyond a friendly note of congratulation



<P>and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady Bertram.&nbsp; It was



<P>the first day for many, many weeks, in which the families



<P>had been wholly divided.&nbsp; Four-and-twenty hours had never



<P>passed before, since August began, without bringing them



<P>together in some way or other.&nbsp; It was a sad, anxious day;



<P>and the morrow, though differing in the sort of evil,



<P>did by no means bring less.&nbsp; A few moments of feverish



<P>enjoyment were followed by hours of acute suffering.



<P>Henry Crawford was again in the house:&nbsp; he walked up



<P>with Dr. Grant, who was anxious to pay his respects to



<P>Sir Thomas, and at rather an early hour they were ushered



<P>into the breakfast-room, where were most of the family.



<P>Sir Thomas soon appeared, and Maria saw with delight



<P>and agitation the introduction of the man she loved to



<P>her father.&nbsp; Her sensations were indefinable, and so were



<P>they a few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford,



<P>who had a chair between herself and Tom, ask the latter



<P>in an undervoice whether there were any plans for resuming



<P>the play after the present happy interruption (with



<P>a courteous glance at Sir Thomas), because, in that case,



<P>he should make a point of returning to Mansfield at any time



<P>required by the party:&nbsp; he was going away immediately,



<P>being to meet his uncle at Bath without delay; but if there



<P>were any prospect of a renewal of Lovers' Vows, he should



<P>hold himself positively engaged, he should break through



<P>every other claim, he should absolutely condition with his



<P>uncle for attending them whenever he might be wanted.



<P>The play should not be lost by _his_ absence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"From Bath, Norfolk, London, York, wherever I may be,"



<P>said he; "I will attend you from any place in England,



<P>at an hour's notice."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was well at that moment that Tom had to speak, and not



<P>his sister.&nbsp; He could immediately say with easy fluency,



<P>"I am sorry you are going; but as to our play, _that_ is



<P>all over--entirely at an end" (looking significantly



<P>at his father). "The painter was sent off yesterday,



<P>and very little will remain of the theatre to-morrow. I knew



<P>how _that_ would be from the first.&nbsp; It is early for Bath.



<P>You will find nobody there."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is about my uncle's usual time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When do you think of going?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I may, perhaps, get as far as Banbury to-day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Whose stables do you use at Bath?" was the next question;



<P>and while this branch of the subject was under discussion,



<P>Maria, who wanted neither pride nor resolution, was preparing



<P>to encounter her share of it with tolerable calmness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To her he soon turned, repeating much of what he had



<P>already said, with only a softened air and stronger



<P>expressions of regret.&nbsp; But what availed his expressions



<P>or his air?&nbsp; He was going, and, if not voluntarily going,



<P>voluntarily intending to stay away; for, excepting what might



<P>be due to his uncle, his engagements were all self-imposed.



<P>He might talk of necessity, but she knew his independence.



<P>The hand which had so pressed hers to his heart! the hand



<P>and the heart were alike motionless and passive now!



<P>Her spirit supported her, but the agony of her mind was severe.



<P>She had not long to endure what arose from listening



<P>to language which his actions contradicted, or to bury



<P>the tumult of her feelings under the restraint of society;



<P>for general civilities soon called his notice from her,



<P>and the farewell visit, as it then became openly acknowledged,



<P>was a very short one.&nbsp; He was gone--he had touched her



<P>hand for the last time, he had made his parting bow,



<P>and she might seek directly all that solitude could do



<P>for her.&nbsp; Henry Crawford was gone, gone from the house,



<P>and within two hours afterwards from the parish;



<P>and so ended all the hopes his selfish vanity had raised



<P>in Maria and Julia Bertram.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Julia could rejoice that he was gone.&nbsp; His presence was



<P>beginning to be odious to her; and if Maria gained him not,



<P>she was now cool enough to dispense with any other revenge.



<P>She did not want exposure to be added to desertion.



<P>Henry Crawford gone, she could even pity her sister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With a purer spirit did Fanny rejoice in the intelligence.



<P>She heard it at dinner, and felt it a blessing.



<P>By all the others it was mentioned with regret;



<P>and his merits honoured with due gradation of feeling--



<P>from the sincerity of Edmund's too partial regard,



<P>to the unconcern of his mother speaking entirely by rote.



<P>Mrs. Norris began to look about her, and wonder that



<P>his falling in love with Julia had come to nothing;



<P>and could almost fear that she had been remiss herself



<P>in forwarding it; but with so many to care for, how was



<P>it possible for even _her_ activity to keep pace with



<P>her wishes?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another day or two, and Mr. Yates was gone likewise.



<P>In _his_ departure Sir Thomas felt the chief interest:



<P>wanting to be alone with his family, the presence of a



<P>stranger superior to Mr. Yates must have been irksome;



<P>but of him, trifling and confident, idle and expensive,



<P>it was every way vexatious.&nbsp; In himself he was wearisome,



<P>but as the friend of Tom and the admirer of Julia he



<P>became offensive.&nbsp; Sir Thomas had been quite indifferent



<P>to Mr. Crawford's going or staying:&nbsp; but his good



<P>wishes for Mr. Yates's having a pleasant journey,



<P>as he walked with him to the hall-door, were given with



<P>genuine satisfaction.&nbsp; Mr. Yates had staid to see the



<P>destruction of every theatrical preparation at Mansfield,



<P>the removal of everything appertaining to the play:



<P>he left the house in all the soberness of its general



<P>character; and Sir Thomas hoped, in seeing him out of it,



<P>to be rid of the worst object connected with the scheme,



<P>and the last that must be inevitably reminding him of



<P>its existence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris contrived to remove one article from his sight



<P>that might have distressed him.&nbsp; The curtain, over which



<P>she had presided with such talent and such success,



<P>went off with her to her cottage, where she happened



<P>to be particularly in want of green baize.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Edmund had great things to hear on his return.&nbsp; Many surprises



<P>were awaiting him.&nbsp; The first that occurred was not least



<P>in interest:&nbsp; the appearance of Henry Crawford and his sister



<P>walking together through the village as he rode into it.



<P>He had concluded--he had meant them to be far distant.



<P>His absence had been extended beyond a fortnight purposely



<P>to avoid Miss Crawford.&nbsp; He was returning to Mansfield



<P>with spirits ready to feed on melancholy remembrances,



<P>and tender associations, when her own fair self was



<P>before him, leaning on her brother's arm, and he found



<P>himself receiving a welcome, unquestionably friendly,



<P>from the woman whom, two moments before, he had been



<P>thinking of as seventy miles off, and as farther,



<P>much farther, from him in inclination than any distance



<P>could express.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her reception of him was of a sort which he could not



<P>have hoped for, had he expected to see her.&nbsp; Coming as he



<P>did from such a purport fulfilled as had taken him away,



<P>he would have expected anything rather than a look



<P>of satisfaction, and words of simple, pleasant meaning.



<P>It was enough to set his heart in a glow, and to bring him



<P>home in the properest state for feeling the full value



<P>of the other joyful surprises at hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>William's promotion, with all its particulars, he was soon



<P>master of; and with such a secret provision of comfort



<P>within his own breast to help the joy, he found in it



<P>a source of most gratifying sensation and unvarying



<P>cheerfulness all dinner-time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After dinner, when he and his father were alone,



<P>he had Fanny's history; and then all the great events



<P>of the last fortnight, and the present situation



<P>of matters at Mansfield were known to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny suspected what was going on.&nbsp; They sat so much



<P>longer than usual in the dining-parlour, that she was sure



<P>they must be talking of her; and when tea at last brought



<P>them away, and she was to be seen by Edmund again, she felt



<P>dreadfully guilty.&nbsp; He came to her, sat down by her,



<P>took her hand, and pressed it kindly; and at that moment



<P>she thought that, but for the occupation and the scene



<P>which the tea-things afforded, she must have betrayed



<P>her emotion in some unpardonable excess.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was not intending, however, by such action,



<P>to be conveying to her that unqualified approbation



<P>and encouragement which her hopes drew from it.



<P>It was designed only to express his participation in all



<P>that interested her, and to tell her that he had been



<P>hearing what quickened every feeling of affection.&nbsp; He was,



<P>in fact, entirely on his father's side of the question.



<P>His surprise was not so great as his father's at her



<P>refusing Crawford, because, so far from supposing



<P>her to consider him with anything like a preference,



<P>he had always believed it to be rather the reverse,



<P>and could imagine her to be taken perfectly unprepared,



<P>but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more



<P>desirable than he did.&nbsp; It had every recommendation to him;



<P>and while honouring her for what she had done under the



<P>influence of her present indifference, honouring her in



<P>rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas could quite echo,



<P>he was most earnest in hoping, and sanguine in believing,



<P>that it would be a match at last, and that, united by



<P>mutual affection, it would appear that their dispositions



<P>were as exactly fitted to make them blessed in each other,



<P>as he was now beginning seriously to consider them.



<P>Crawford had been too precipitate.&nbsp; He had not given her



<P>time to attach herself.&nbsp; He had begun at the wrong end.



<P>With such powers as his, however, and such a disposition



<P>as hers, Edmund trusted that everything would work



<P>out a happy conclusion.&nbsp; Meanwhile, he saw enough



<P>of Fanny's embarrassment to make him scrupulously guard



<P>against exciting it a second time, by any word, or look,



<P>or movement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Crawford called the next day, and on the score of Edmund's



<P>return, Sir Thomas felt himself more than licensed to ask



<P>him to stay dinner; it was really a necessary compliment.



<P>He staid of course, and Edmund had then ample opportunity



<P>for observing how he sped with Fanny, and what degree



<P>of immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from



<P>her manners; and it was so little, so very, very little--



<P>every chance, every possibility of it, resting upon her



<P>embarrassment only; if there was not hope in her confusion,



<P>there was hope in nothing else--that he was almost ready



<P>to wonder at his friend's perseverance.&nbsp; Fanny was worth



<P>it all; he held her to be worth every effort of patience,



<P>every exertion of mind, but he did not think he could have



<P>gone on himself with any woman breathing, without something



<P>more to warm his courage than his eyes could discern in hers.



<P>He was very willing to hope that Crawford saw clearer,



<P>and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his



<P>friend that he could come to from all that he observed



<P>to pass before, and at, and after dinner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the evening a few circumstances occurred which he thought



<P>more promising.&nbsp; When he and Crawford walked into the



<P>drawing-room, his mother and Fanny were sitting as intently



<P>and silently at work as if there were nothing else to care for.



<P>Edmund could not help noticing their apparently deep tranquillity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We have not been so silent all the time," replied his mother.



<P>"Fanny has been reading to me, and only put the book



<P>down upon hearing you coming."&nbsp; And sure enough there



<P>was a book on the table which had the air of being



<P>very recently closed:&nbsp; a volume of Shakespeare.



<P>"She often reads to me out of those books; and she



<P>was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man's--



<P>what's his name, Fanny?--when we heard your footsteps."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Crawford took the volume.&nbsp; "Let me have the pleasure



<P>of finishing that speech to your ladyship," said he.



<P>"I shall find it immediately."&nbsp; And by carefully giving



<P>way to the inclination of the leaves, he did find it,



<P>or within a page or two, quite near enough to satisfy



<P>Lady Bertram, who assured him, as soon as he mentioned the



<P>name of Cardinal Wolsey, that he had got the very speech.



<P>Not a look or an offer of help had Fanny given; not a syllable



<P>for or against.&nbsp; All her attention was for her work.



<P>She seemed determined to be interested by nothing else.



<P>But taste was too strong in her.&nbsp; She could not abstract



<P>her mind five minutes:&nbsp; she was forced to listen; his reading



<P>was capital, and her pleasure in good reading extreme.



<P>To _good_ reading, however, she had been long used:



<P>her uncle read well, her cousins all, Edmund very well,



<P>but in Mr. Crawford's reading there was a variety of



<P>excellence beyond what she had ever met with.&nbsp; The King,



<P>the Queen, Buckingham, Wolsey, Cromwell, all were given



<P>in turn; for with the happiest knack, the happiest



<P>power of jumping and guessing, he could always alight



<P>at will on the best scene, or the best speeches of each;



<P>and whether it were dignity, or pride, or tenderness,



<P>or remorse, or whatever were to be expressed, he could



<P>do it with equal beauty.&nbsp; It was truly dramatic.



<P>His acting had first taught Fanny what pleasure a play



<P>might give, and his reading brought all his acting before



<P>her again; nay, perhaps with greater enjoyment, for it



<P>came unexpectedly, and with no such drawback as she had



<P>been used to suffer in seeing him on the stage with Miss



<P>Bertram.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund watched the progress of her attention, and was



<P>amused and gratified by seeing how she gradually slackened



<P>in the needlework, which at the beginning seemed to



<P>occupy her totally:&nbsp; how it fell from her hand while



<P>she sat motionless over it, and at last, how the eyes



<P>which had appeared so studiously to avoid him throughout



<P>the day were turned and fixed on Crawford--fixed on him



<P>for minutes, fixed on him, in short, till the attraction



<P>drew Crawford's upon her, and the book was closed,



<P>and the charm was broken.&nbsp; Then she was shrinking again



<P>into herself, and blushing and working as hard as ever;



<P>but it had been enough to give Edmund encouragement



<P>for his friend, and as he cordially thanked him,



<P>he hoped to be expressing Fanny's secret feelings too.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That play must be a favourite with you," said he;



<P>"you read as if you knew it well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It will be a favourite, I believe, from this hour,"



<P>replied Crawford; "but I do not think I have had a volume



<P>of Shakespeare in my hand before since I was fifteen.



<P>I once saw Henry the Eighth acted, or I have heard



<P>of it from somebody who did, I am not certain which.



<P>But Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how.



<P>It is a part of an Englishman's constitution.&nbsp; His thoughts



<P>and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches



<P>them everywhere; one is intimate with him by instinct.



<P>No man of any brain can open at a good part of one



<P>of his plays without falling into the flow of his



<P>meaning immediately."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree,"



<P>said Edmund, "from one's earliest years.&nbsp; His celebrated



<P>passages are quoted by everybody; they are in half



<P>the books we open, and we all talk Shakespeare,



<P>use his similes, and describe with his descriptions;



<P>but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you



<P>gave it.&nbsp; To know him in bits and scraps is common enough;



<P>to know him pretty thoroughly is, perhaps, not uncommon;



<P>but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sir, you do me honour," was Crawford's answer, with a bow



<P>of mock gravity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Both gentlemen had a glance at Fanny, to see if a word



<P>of accordant praise could be extorted from her; yet both



<P>feeling that it could not be.&nbsp; Her praise had been given



<P>in her attention; _that_ must content them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Bertram's admiration was expressed, and strongly too.



<P>"It was really like being at a play," said she.&nbsp; "I wish



<P>Sir Thomas had been here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Crawford was excessively pleased.&nbsp; If Lady Bertram,



<P>with all her incompetency and languor, could feel this,



<P>the inference of what her niece, alive and enlightened



<P>as she was, must feel, was elevating.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have a great turn for acting, I am sure, Mr. Crawford,"



<P>said her ladyship soon afterwards; "and I will tell you what,



<P>I think you will have a theatre, some time or other,



<P>at your house in Norfolk.&nbsp; I mean when you are settled there.



<P>I do indeed.&nbsp; I think you will fit up a theatre at your



<P>house in Norfolk."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you, ma'am?" cried he, with quickness.&nbsp; "No, no,



<P>that will never be.&nbsp; Your ladyship is quite mistaken.



<P>No theatre at Everingham!&nbsp; Oh no!"&nbsp; And he looked at Fanny



<P>with an expressive smile, which evidently meant, "That lady



<P>will never allow a theatre at Everingham."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund saw it all, and saw Fanny so determined _not_ to see it,



<P>as to make it clear that the voice was enough to convey



<P>the full meaning of the protestation; and such a quick



<P>consciousness of compliment, such a ready comprehension



<P>of a hint, he thought, was rather favourable than not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The subject of reading aloud was farther discussed.



<P>The two young men were the only talkers, but they,



<P>standing by the fire, talked over the too common neglect



<P>of the qualification, the total inattention to it, in the



<P>ordinary school-system for boys, the consequently natural,



<P>yet in some instances almost unnatural, degree of ignorance



<P>and uncouthness of men, of sensible and well-informed men,



<P>when suddenly called to the necessity of reading aloud,



<P>which had fallen within their notice, giving instances



<P>of blunders, and failures with their secondary causes,



<P>the want of management of the voice, of proper modulation



<P>and emphasis, of foresight and judgment, all proceeding



<P>from the first cause:&nbsp; want of early attention and habit;



<P>and Fanny was listening again with great entertainment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Even in my profession," said Edmund, with a smile,



<P>"how little the art of reading has been studied! how little



<P>a clear manner, and good delivery, have been attended to!



<P>I speak rather of the past, however, than the present.



<P>There is now a spirit of improvement abroad; but among



<P>those who were ordained twenty, thirty, forty years ago,



<P>the larger number, to judge by their performance,



<P>must have thought reading was reading, and preaching



<P>was preaching.&nbsp; It is different now.&nbsp; The subject is more



<P>justly considered.&nbsp; It is felt that distinctness and energy



<P>may have weight in recommending the most solid truths;



<P>and besides, there is more general observation and taste,



<P>a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly;



<P>in every congregation there is a larger proportion



<P>who know a little of the matter, and who can judge



<P>and criticise."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund had already gone through the service once since



<P>his ordination; and upon this being understood, he had



<P>a variety of questions from Crawford as to his feelings



<P>and success; questions, which being made, though with the



<P>vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste, without any



<P>touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund



<P>knew to be most offensive to Fanny, he had true pleasure



<P>in satisfying; and when Crawford proceeded to ask his



<P>opinion and give his own as to the properest manner in which



<P>particular passages in the service should be delivered,



<P>shewing it to be a subject on which he had thought before,



<P>and thought with judgment, Edmund was still more and



<P>more pleased.&nbsp; This would be the way to Fanny's heart.



<P>She was not to be won by all that gallantry and wit and



<P>good-nature together could do; or, at least, she would



<P>not be won by them nearly so soon, without the assistance



<P>of sentiment and feeling, and seriousness on serious subjects

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Our liturgy," observed Crawford, "has beauties, which not



<P>even a careless, slovenly style of reading can destroy;



<P>but it has also redundancies and repetitions which require



<P>good reading not to be felt.&nbsp; For myself, at least, I must



<P>confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be"



<P>(here was a glance at Fanny); "that nineteen times out of



<P>twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read,



<P>and longing to have it to read myself.&nbsp; Did you speak?"



<P>stepping eagerly to Fanny, and addressing her in a



<P>softened voice; and upon her saying "No," he added,



<P>"Are you sure you did not speak?&nbsp; I saw your lips move.



<P>I fancied you might be going to tell me I ought to be



<P>more attentive, and not _allow_ my thoughts to wander.



<P>Are not you going to tell me so?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, indeed, you know your duty too well for me to--



<P>even supposing--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She stopt, felt herself getting into a puzzle, and could



<P>not be prevailed on to add another word, not by dint



<P>of several minutes of supplication and waiting.&nbsp; He then



<P>returned to his former station, and went on as if there



<P>had been no such tender interruption.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A sermon, well delivered, is more uncommon even than prayers



<P>well read.&nbsp; A sermon, good in itself, is no rare thing.



<P>It is more difficult to speak well than to compose well;



<P>that is, the rules and trick of composition are



<P>oftener an object of study.&nbsp; A thoroughly good sermon,



<P>thoroughly well delivered, is a capital gratification.



<P>I can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration



<P>and respect, and more than half a mind to take orders



<P>and preach myself.&nbsp; There is something in the eloquence



<P>of the pulpit, when it is really eloquence, which is entitled



<P>to the highest praise and honour.&nbsp; The preacher who can



<P>touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers,



<P>on subjects limited, and long worn threadbare in all



<P>common hands; who can say anything new or striking,



<P>anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste,



<P>or wearing out the feelings of his hearers, is a man whom



<P>one could not, in his public capacity, honour enough.



<P>I should like to be such a man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund laughed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should indeed.&nbsp; I never listened to a distinguished



<P>preacher in my life without a sort of envy.&nbsp; But then,



<P>I must have a London audience.&nbsp; I could not preach but



<P>to the educated; to those who were capable of estimating



<P>my composition.&nbsp; And I do not know that I should be fond



<P>of preaching often; now and then, perhaps once or twice



<P>in the spring, after being anxiously expected for half



<P>a dozen Sundays together; but not for a constancy;



<P>it would not do for a constancy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here Fanny, who could not but listen, involuntarily shook



<P>her head, and Crawford was instantly by her side again,



<P>entreating to know her meaning; and as Edmund perceived,



<P>by his drawing in a chair, and sitting down close by her,



<P>that it was to be a very thorough attack, that looks



<P>and undertones were to be well tried, he sank as quietly



<P>as possible into a corner, turned his back, and took up



<P>a newspaper, very sincerely wishing that dear little



<P>Fanny might be persuaded into explaining away that shake



<P>of the head to the satisfaction of her ardent lover;



<P>and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the business



<P>from himself in murmurs of his own, over the various



<P>advertisements of "A most desirable Estate in South



<P>Wales"; "To Parents and Guardians"; and a "Capital



<P>season'd Hunter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, meanwhile, vexed with herself for not having been



<P>as motionless as she was speechless, and grieved to the heart



<P>to see Edmund's arrangements, was trying by everything



<P>in the power of her modest, gentle nature, to repulse



<P>Mr. Crawford, and avoid both his looks and inquiries;



<P>and he, unrepulsable, was persisting in both.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What did that shake of the head mean?" said he.&nbsp; "What was



<P>it meant to express?&nbsp; Disapprobation, I fear.&nbsp; But of what?



<P>What had I been saying to displease you?&nbsp; Did you think me



<P>speaking improperly, lightly, irreverently on the subject?



<P>Only tell me if I was.&nbsp; Only tell me if I was wrong.



<P>I want to be set right.&nbsp; Nay, nay, I entreat you;



<P>for one moment put down your work.&nbsp; What did that shake



<P>of the head mean?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In vain was her "Pray, sir, don't; pray, Mr. Crawford,"



<P>repeated twice over; and in vain did she try to move away.



<P>In the same low, eager voice, and the same close neighbourhood,



<P>he went on, reurging the same questions as before.



<P>She grew more agitated and displeased.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How can you, sir?&nbsp; You quite astonish me; I wonder



<P>how you can--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do I astonish you?" said he.&nbsp; "Do you wonder?&nbsp; Is there



<P>anything in my present entreaty that you do not understand?



<P>I will explain to you instantly all that makes me urge



<P>you in this manner, all that gives me an interest in



<P>what you look and do, and excites my present curiosity.



<P>I will not leave you to wonder long."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In spite of herself, she could not help half a smile,



<P>but she said nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You shook your head at my acknowledging that I should



<P>not like to engage in the duties of a clergyman always



<P>for a constancy.&nbsp; Yes, that was the word.&nbsp; Constancy:&nbsp;

I am



<P>not afraid of the word.&nbsp; I would spell it, read it,



<P>write it with anybody.&nbsp; I see nothing alarming in the word.



<P>Did you think I ought?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps, sir," said Fanny, wearied at last into speaking--



<P>"perhaps, sir, I thought it was a pity you did not always



<P>know yourself as well as you seemed to do at that moment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Crawford, delighted to get her to speak at any rate,



<P>was determined to keep it up; and poor Fanny, who had



<P>hoped to silence him by such an extremity of reproof,



<P>found herself sadly mistaken, and that it was only a change



<P>from one object of curiosity and one set of words to another.



<P>He had always something to entreat the explanation of.



<P>The opportunity was too fair.&nbsp; None such had occurred



<P>since his seeing her in her uncle's room, none such might



<P>occur again before his leaving Mansfield.&nbsp; Lady Bertram's



<P>being just on the other side of the table was a trifle,



<P>for she might always be considered as only half-awake, and



<P>Edmund's advertisements were still of the first utility.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said Crawford, after a course of rapid questions



<P>and reluctant answers; "I am happier than I was, because I



<P>now understand more clearly your opinion of me.&nbsp; You think



<P>me unsteady:&nbsp; easily swayed by the whim of the moment,



<P>easily tempted, easily put aside.&nbsp; With such an opinion,



<P>no wonder that.&nbsp; But we shall see.&nbsp; It is not by protestations



<P>that I shall endeavour to convince you I am wronged;



<P>it is not by telling you that my affections are steady.



<P>My conduct shall speak for me; absence, distance, time shall



<P>speak for me.&nbsp; _They_ shall prove that, as far as you



<P>can be deserved by anybody, I do deserve you.&nbsp; You are



<P>infinitely my superior in merit; all _that_ I know.



<P>You have qualities which I had not before supposed



<P>to exist in such a degree in any human creature.



<P>You have some touches of the angel in you beyond what--



<P>not merely beyond what one sees, because one never sees



<P>anything like it--but beyond what one fancies might be.



<P>But still I am not frightened.&nbsp; It is not by equality of



<P>merit that you can be won.&nbsp; That is out of the question.



<P>It is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest,



<P>who loves you most devotedly, that has the best



<P>right to a return.&nbsp; There I build my confidence.



<P>By that right I do and will deserve you; and when once



<P>convinced that my attachment is what I declare it,



<P>I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes.



<P>Yes, dearest, sweetest Fanny.&nbsp; Nay" (seeing her draw back



<P>displeased), "forgive me.&nbsp; Perhaps I have as yet no right;



<P>but by what other name can I call you?&nbsp; Do you suppose



<P>you are ever present to my imagination under any other?



<P>No, it is 'Fanny' that I think of all day, and dream



<P>of all night.&nbsp; You have given the name such reality



<P>of sweetness, that nothing else can now be descriptive



<P>of you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny could hardly have kept her seat any longer,



<P>or have refrained from at least trying to get away in



<P>spite of all the too public opposition she foresaw to it,



<P>had it not been for the sound of approaching relief,



<P>the very sound which she had been long watching for,



<P>and long thinking strangely delayed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The solemn procession, headed by Baddeley, of tea-board, urn,



<P>and cake-bearers, made its appearance, and delivered



<P>her from a grievous imprisonment of body and mind.



<P>Mr. Crawford was obliged to move.&nbsp; She was at liberty,



<P>she was busy, she was protected.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund was not sorry to be admitted again among the



<P>number of those who might speak and hear.&nbsp; But though



<P>the conference had seemed full long to him, and though



<P>on looking at Fanny he saw rather a flush of vexation,



<P>he inclined to hope that so much could not have been



<P>said and listened to without some profit to the speaker.

<B>CHAPTER VIII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Fanny's rides recommenced the very next day; and as it



<P>was a pleasant fresh-feeling morning, less hot than the



<P>weather had lately been, Edmund trusted that her losses,



<P>both of health and pleasure, would be soon made good.



<P>While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived, escorting his mother,



<P>who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially,



<P>in urging the execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton,



<P>which had been started a fortnight before, and which,



<P>in consequence of her subsequent absence from home,



<P>had since lain dormant.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris and her nieces were all



<P>well pleased with its revival, and an early day was named



<P>and agreed to, provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged:



<P>the young ladies did not forget that stipulation, and though



<P>Mrs. Norris would willingly have answered for his being so,



<P>they would neither authorise the liberty nor run the risk;



<P>and at last, on a hint from Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth



<P>discovered that the properest thing to be done was for



<P>him to walk down to the Parsonage directly, and call on



<P>Mr. Crawford, and inquire whether Wednesday would suit him



<P>or not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in.



<P>Having been out some time, and taken a different route



<P>to the house, they had not met him.&nbsp; Comfortable hopes,



<P>however, were given that he would find Mr. Crawford



<P>at home.&nbsp; The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course.



<P>It was hardly possible, indeed, that anything else should



<P>be talked of, for Mrs. Norris was in high spirits about it;



<P>and Mrs. Rushworth, a well-meaning, civil, prosing,



<P>pompous woman, who thought nothing of consequence, but as it



<P>related to her own and her son's concerns, had not yet



<P>given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party.



<P>Lady Bertram constantly declined it; but her placid manner



<P>of refusal made Mrs. Rushworth still think she wished



<P>to come, till Mrs. Norris's more numerous words and louder



<P>tone convinced her of the truth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The fatigue would be too much for my sister, a great



<P>deal too much, I assure you, my dear Mrs. Rushworth.



<P>Ten miles there, and ten back, you know.&nbsp; You must



<P>excuse my sister on this occasion, and accept of our



<P>two dear girls and myself without her.&nbsp; Sotherton is



<P>the only place that could give her a _wish_ to go so far,



<P>but it cannot be, indeed.&nbsp; She will have a companion



<P>in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very well;



<P>and as for Edmund, as he is not here to speak for himself,



<P>I will answer for his being most happy to join the party.



<P>He can go on horseback, you know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram's



<P>staying at home, could only be sorry.&nbsp; "The loss of her



<P>ladyship's company would be a great drawback, and she



<P>should have been extremely happy to have seen the young



<P>lady too, Miss Price, who had never been at Sotherton yet,



<P>and it was a pity she should not see the place."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are very kind, you are all kindness, my dear madam,"



<P>cried Mrs. Norris; "but as to Fanny, she will have



<P>opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton.&nbsp; She has



<P>time enough before her; and her going now is quite out



<P>of the question.&nbsp; Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh no!&nbsp; I cannot do without Fanny."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that



<P>everybody must be wanting to see Sotherton, to include



<P>Miss Crawford in the invitation; and though Mrs. Grant,



<P>who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs. Rushworth,



<P>on her coming into the neighbourhood, civilly declined it



<P>on her own account, she was glad to secure any pleasure



<P>for her sister; and Mary, properly pressed and persuaded,



<P>was not long in accepting her share of the civility.



<P>Mr. Rushworth came back from the Parsonage successful;



<P>and Edmund made his appearance just in time to learn what



<P>had been settled for Wednesday, to attend Mrs. Rushworth



<P>to her carriage, and walk half-way down the park with the two



<P>other ladies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On his return to the breakfast-room, he found Mrs. Norris



<P>trying to make up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford's



<P>being of the party were desirable or not, or whether



<P>her brother's barouche would not be full without her.



<P>The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea, assuring her



<P>that the barouche would hold four perfectly well,



<P>independent of the box, on which _one_ might go with him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But why is it necessary," said Edmund, "that Crawford's carriage,



<P>or his _only_, should be employed?&nbsp; Why is no use to be



<P>made of my mother's chaise?&nbsp; I could not, when the scheme



<P>was first mentioned the other day, understand why a visit



<P>from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What!" cried Julia:&nbsp; "go boxed up three in a postchaise



<P>in this weather, when we may have seats in a barouche!



<P>No, my dear Edmund, that will not quite do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Besides," said Maria, "I know that Mr. Crawford depends



<P>upon taking us.&nbsp; After what passed at first, he would



<P>claim it as a promise."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And, my dear Edmund," added Mrs. Norris, "taking out _two_



<P>carriages when _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing;



<P>and, between ourselves, coachman is not very fond of the



<P>roads between this and Sotherton:&nbsp; he always complains



<P>bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage,



<P>and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas,



<P>when he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That would not be a very handsome reason for using



<P>Mr. Crawford's," said Maria; "but the truth is, that Wilcox



<P>is a stupid old fellow, and does not know how to drive.



<P>I will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience



<P>from narrow roads on Wednesday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant,"



<P>said Edmund, "in going on the barouche box."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Unpleasant!" cried Maria:&nbsp; "oh dear!&nbsp; I believe it would



<P>be generally thought the favourite seat.&nbsp; There can



<P>be no comparison as to one's view of the country.



<P>Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-box herself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There can be no objection, then, to Fanny's going with you;



<P>there can be no doubt of your having room for her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Fanny!" repeated Mrs. Norris; "my dear Edmund, there is



<P>no idea of her going with us.&nbsp; She stays with her aunt.



<P>I told Mrs. Rushworth so.&nbsp; She is not expected."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You can have no reason, I imagine, madam," said he,



<P>addressing his mother, "for wishing Fanny _not_



<P>to be of the party, but as it relates to yourself,



<P>to your own comfort.&nbsp; If you could do without her,



<P>you would not wish to keep her at home?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure not, but I _cannot_ do without her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You can, if I stay at home with you, as I mean to do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a general cry out at this.&nbsp; "Yes," he continued,



<P>"there is no necessity for my going, and I mean to stay



<P>at home.&nbsp; Fanny has a great desire to see Sotherton.



<P>I know she wishes it very much.&nbsp; She has not often a



<P>gratification of the kind, and I am sure, ma'am, you would



<P>be glad to give her the pleasure now?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh yes! very glad, if your aunt sees no objection."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which



<P>could remain--their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth



<P>that Fanny could not go, and the very strange appearance



<P>there would consequently be in taking her, which seemed



<P>to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got over.



<P>It must have the strangest appearance!&nbsp; It would be



<P>something so very unceremonious, so bordering on disrespect



<P>for Mrs. Rushworth, whose own manners were such a pattern



<P>of good-breeding and attention, that she really did not



<P>feel equal to it.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris had no affection for Fanny,



<P>and no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time;



<P>but her opposition to Edmund _now_, arose more from



<P>partiality for her own scheme, because it _was_ her own,



<P>than from anything else.&nbsp; She felt that she had arranged



<P>everything extremely well, and that any alteration must be



<P>for the worse.&nbsp; When Edmund, therefore, told her in reply,



<P>as he did when she would give him the hearing, that she



<P>need not distress herself on Mrs. Rushworth's account,



<P>because he had taken the opportunity, as he walked with



<P>her through the hall, of mentioning Miss Price as one



<P>who would probably be of the party, and had directly



<P>received a very sufficient invitation for his cousin,



<P>Mrs. Norris was too much vexed to submit with a very



<P>good grace, and would only say, "Very well, very well,



<P>just as you chuse, settle it your own way, I am sure I



<P>do not care about it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It seems very odd," said Maria, "that you should be



<P>staying at home instead of Fanny."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,"



<P>added Julia, hastily leaving the room as she spoke,



<P>from a consciousness that she ought to offer to stay at



<P>home herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires,"



<P>was Edmund's only reply, and the subject dropt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's gratitude, when she heard the plan, was, in fact,



<P>much greater than her pleasure.&nbsp; She felt Edmund's kindness



<P>with all, and more than all, the sensibility which he,



<P>unsuspicious of her fond attachment, could be aware of;



<P>but that he should forego any enjoyment on her account gave



<P>her pain, and her own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton would



<P>be nothing without him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The next meeting of the two Mansfield families produced



<P>another alteration in the plan, and one that was admitted



<P>with general approbation.&nbsp; Mrs. Grant offered herself as



<P>companion for the day to Lady Bertram in lieu of her son,



<P>and Dr. Grant was to join them at dinner.&nbsp; Lady Bertram



<P>was very well pleased to have it so, and the young ladies



<P>were in spirits again.&nbsp; Even Edmund was very thankful for an



<P>arrangement which restored him to his share of the party;



<P>and Mrs. Norris thought it an excellent plan, and had it



<P>at her tongue's end, and was on the point of proposing it,



<P>when Mrs. Grant spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wednesday was fine, and soon after breakfast the barouche



<P>arrived, Mr. Crawford driving his sisters; and as everybody



<P>was ready, there was nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant



<P>to alight and the others to take their places.&nbsp; The place



<P>of all places, the envied seat, the post of honour,



<P>was unappropriated.&nbsp; To whose happy lot was it to fall?



<P>While each of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best,



<P>and with the most appearance of obliging the others,



<P>to secure it, the matter was settled by Mrs. Grant's saying,



<P>as she stepped from the carriage, "As there are five



<P>of you, it will be better that one should sit with Henry;



<P>and as you were saying lately that you wished you



<P>could drive, Julia, I think this will be a good opportunity



<P>for you to take a lesson."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Happy Julia!&nbsp; Unhappy Maria!&nbsp; The former was on the



<P>barouche-box in a moment, the latter took her seat within,



<P>in gloom and mortification; and the carriage drove



<P>off amid the good wishes of the two remaining ladies,



<P>and the barking of Pug in his mistress's arms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their road was through a pleasant country; and Fanny,



<P>whose rides had never been extensive, was soon beyond



<P>her knowledge, and was very happy in observing all that



<P>was new, and admiring all that was pretty.&nbsp; She was not



<P>often invited to join in the conversation of the others,



<P>nor did she desire it.&nbsp; Her own thoughts and reflections



<P>were habitually her best companions; and, in observing



<P>the appearance of the country, the bearings of the roads,



<P>the difference of soil, the state of the harvest, the cottages,



<P>the cattle, the children, she found entertainment



<P>that could only have been heightened by having Edmund



<P>to speak to of what she felt.&nbsp; That was the only point



<P>of resemblance between her and the lady who sat by her:



<P>in everything but a value for Edmund, Miss Crawford was



<P>very unlike her.&nbsp; She had none of Fanny's delicacy of taste,



<P>of mind, of feeling; she saw Nature, inanimate Nature,



<P>with little observation; her attention was all for men



<P>and women, her talents for the light and lively.



<P>In looking back after Edmund, however, when there was



<P>any stretch of road behind them, or when he gained on



<P>them in ascending a considerable hill, they were united,



<P>and a "there he is" broke at the same moment from them both,



<P>more than once.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little



<P>real comfort:&nbsp; her prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford



<P>and her sister sitting side by side, full of conversation



<P>and merriment; and to see only his expressive profile



<P>as he turned with a smile to Julia, or to catch the laugh



<P>of the other, was a perpetual source of irritation,



<P>which her own sense of propriety could but just smooth over.



<P>When Julia looked back, it was with a countenance of delight,



<P>and whenever she spoke to them, it was in the highest spirits:



<P>"her view of the country was charming, she wished they



<P>could all see it," etc.; but her only offer of exchange



<P>was addressed to Miss Crawford, as they gained the summit



<P>of a long hill, and was not more inviting than this:



<P>"Here is a fine burst of country.&nbsp; I wish you had my seat,



<P>but I dare say you will not take it, let me press you ever



<P>so much;" and Miss Crawford could hardly answer before they



<P>were moving again at a good pace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When they came within the influence of Sotherton associations,



<P>it was better for Miss Bertram, who might be said to have



<P>two strings to her bow.&nbsp; She had Rushworth feelings,



<P>and Crawford feelings, and in the vicinity of Sotherton



<P>the former had considerable effect.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth's



<P>consequence was hers.&nbsp; She could not tell Miss Crawford



<P>that "those woods belonged to Sotherton," she could not



<P>carelessly observe that "she believed that it was now



<P>all Mr. Rushworth's property on each side of the road,"



<P>without elation of heart; and it was a pleasure to increase



<P>with their approach to the capital freehold mansion,



<P>and ancient manorial residence of the family, with all



<P>its rights of court-leet and court-baron.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now we shall have no more rough road, Miss Crawford;



<P>our difficulties are over.&nbsp; The rest of the way is such



<P>as it ought to be.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth has made it since he



<P>succeeded to the estate.&nbsp; Here begins the village.



<P>Those cottages are really a disgrace.&nbsp; The church spire



<P>is reckoned remarkably handsome.&nbsp; I am glad the church



<P>is not so close to the great house as often happens in



<P>old places.&nbsp; The annoyance of the bells must be terrible.



<P>There is the parsonage:&nbsp; a tidy-looking house, and I



<P>understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people.



<P>Those are almshouses, built by some of the family.



<P>To the right is the steward's house; he is a very



<P>respectable man.&nbsp; Now we are coming to the lodge-gates;



<P>but we have nearly a mile through the park still.



<P>It is not ugly, you see, at this end; there is some



<P>fine timber, but the situation of the house is dreadful.



<P>We go down hill to it for half a mile, and it is a pity,



<P>for it would not be an ill-looking place if it had a



<P>better approach."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford was not slow to admire; she pretty well guessed



<P>Miss Bertram's feelings, and made it a point of honour



<P>to promote her enjoyment to the utmost.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris was



<P>all delight and volubility; and even Fanny had something



<P>to say in admiration, and might be heard with complacency.



<P>Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach;



<P>and after being at some pains to get a view of the house,



<P>and observing that "it was a sort of building which she



<P>could not look at but with respect," she added, "Now, where



<P>is the avenue?&nbsp; The house fronts the east, I perceive.



<P>The avenue, therefore, must be at the back of it.



<P>Mr. Rushworth talked of the west front."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, it is exactly behind the house; begins at a little



<P>distance, and ascends for half a mile to the extremity



<P>of the grounds.&nbsp; You may see something of it here--



<P>something of the more distant trees.&nbsp; It is oak entirely."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Bertram could now speak with decided information



<P>of what she had known nothing about when Mr. Rushworth



<P>had asked her opinion; and her spirits were in as happy



<P>a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish, when they drove



<P>up to the spacious stone steps before the principal entrance.

<B>CHAPTER IX</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Rushworth was at the door to receive his fair lady;



<P>and the whole party were welcomed by him with due attention.



<P>In the drawing-room they were met with equal cordiality



<P>by the mother, and Miss Bertram had all the distinction



<P>with each that she could wish.&nbsp; After the business



<P>of arriving was over, it was first necessary to eat,



<P>and the doors were thrown open to admit them through one



<P>or two intermediate rooms into the appointed dining-parlour,



<P>where a collation was prepared with abundance and elegance.



<P>Much was said, and much was ate, and all went well.



<P>The particular object of the day was then considered.



<P>How would Mr. Crawford like, in what manner would he chuse,



<P>to take a survey of the grounds?&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth mentioned



<P>his curricle.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford suggested the greater desirableness



<P>of some carriage which might convey more than two.



<P>"To be depriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes



<P>and other judgments, might be an evil even beyond the loss



<P>of present pleasure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Rushworth proposed that the chaise should be taken also;



<P>but this was scarcely received as an amendment:&nbsp; the young



<P>ladies neither smiled nor spoke.&nbsp; Her next proposition,



<P>of shewing the house to such of them as had not been



<P>there before, was more acceptable, for Miss Bertram was



<P>pleased to have its size displayed, and all were glad



<P>to be doing something.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The whole party rose accordingly, and under Mrs. Rushworth's



<P>guidance were shewn through a number of rooms, all lofty,



<P>and many large, and amply furnished in the taste of fifty



<P>years back, with shining floors, solid mahogany, rich damask,



<P>marble, gilding, and carving, each handsome in its way.



<P>Of pictures there were abundance, and some few good,



<P>but the larger part were family portraits, no longer



<P>anything to anybody but Mrs. Rushworth, who had been at



<P>great pains to learn all that the housekeeper could teach,



<P>and was now almost equally well qualified to shew the house.



<P>On the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly



<P>to Miss Crawford and Fanny, but there was no comparison



<P>in the willingness of their attention; for Miss Crawford,



<P>who had seen scores of great houses, and cared for none



<P>of them, had only the appearance of civilly listening,



<P>while Fanny, to whom everything was almost as interesting



<P>as it was new, attended with unaffected earnestness to all



<P>that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the family in former times,



<P>its rise and grandeur, regal visits and loyal efforts,



<P>delighted to connect anything with history already known,



<P>or warm her imagination with scenes of the past.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The situation of the house excluded the possibility



<P>of much prospect from any of the rooms; and while Fanny



<P>and some of the others were attending Mrs. Rushworth,



<P>Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking his head



<P>at the windows.&nbsp; Every room on the west front looked



<P>across a lawn to the beginning of the avenue immediately



<P>beyond tall iron palisades and gates.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Having visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be



<P>of any other use than to contribute to the window-tax, and



<P>find employment for housemaids, "Now," said Mrs. Rushworth,



<P>"we are coming to the chapel, which properly we ought



<P>to enter from above, and look down upon; but as we



<P>are quite among friends, I will take you in this way,



<P>if you will excuse me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They entered.&nbsp; Fanny's imagination had prepared her



<P>for something grander than a mere spacious, oblong room,



<P>fitted up for the purpose of devotion:&nbsp; with nothing more



<P>striking or more solemn than the profusion of mahogany,



<P>and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge



<P>of the family gallery above.&nbsp; "I am disappointed,"



<P>said she, in a low voice, to Edmund.&nbsp; "This is not



<P>my idea of a chapel.&nbsp; There is nothing awful here,



<P>nothing melancholy, nothing grand.&nbsp; Here are no aisles,



<P>no arches, no inscriptions, no banners.&nbsp; No banners,



<P>cousin, to be 'blown by the night wind of heaven.'



<P>No signs that a 'Scottish monarch sleeps below.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You forget, Fanny, how lately all this has been built,



<P>and for how confined a purpose, compared with the old



<P>chapels of castles and monasteries.&nbsp; It was only for



<P>the private use of the family.&nbsp; They have been buried,



<P>I suppose, in the parish church.&nbsp; _There_ you must look



<P>for the banners and the achievements."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was foolish of me not to think of all that; but I



<P>am disappointed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Rushworth began her relation.&nbsp; "This chapel was fitted up



<P>as you see it, in James the Second's time.&nbsp; Before that period,



<P>as I understand, the pews were only wainscot; and there



<P>is some reason to think that the linings and cushions



<P>of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth;



<P>but this is not quite certain.&nbsp; It is a handsome chapel,



<P>and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening.



<P>Prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain,



<P>within the memory of many; but the late Mr. Rushworth left



<P>it off."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Every generation has its improvements," said Miss Crawford,



<P>with a smile, to Edmund.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford;



<P>and Edmund, Fanny, and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster



<P>together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is a pity," cried Fanny, "that the custom should have



<P>been discontinued.&nbsp; It was a valuable part of former times.



<P>There is something in a chapel and chaplain so much



<P>in character with a great house, with one's ideas of what



<P>such a household should be!&nbsp; A whole family assembling



<P>regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very fine indeed," said Miss Crawford, laughing.&nbsp; "It must



<P>do the heads of the family a great deal of good to force



<P>all the poor housemaids and footmen to leave business



<P>and pleasure, and say their prayers here twice a day,



<P>while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying



<P>away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_That_ is hardly Fanny's idea of a family assembling,"



<P>said Edmund.&nbsp; "If the master and mistress do _not_



<P>attend themselves, there must be more harm than good



<P>in the custom."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"At any rate, it is safer to leave people to their own



<P>devices on such subjects.&nbsp; Everybody likes to go their



<P>own way--to chuse their own time and manner of devotion.



<P>The obligation of attendance, the formality, the restraint,



<P>the length of time--altogether it is a formidable thing,



<P>and what nobody likes; and if the good people who used



<P>to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen



<P>that the time would ever come when men and women might lie



<P>another ten minutes in bed, when they woke with a headache,



<P>without danger of reprobation, because chapel was missed,



<P>they would have jumped with joy and envy.&nbsp; Cannot you



<P>imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles



<P>of the house of Rushworth did many a time repair to



<P>this chapel?&nbsp; The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs. Bridgets--



<P>starched up into seeming piety, but with heads full



<P>of something very different--especially if the poor



<P>chaplain were not worth looking at--and, in those days,



<P>I fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they



<P>are now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For a few moments she was unanswered.&nbsp; Fanny coloured



<P>and looked at Edmund, but felt too angry for speech;



<P>and he needed a little recollection before he could say,



<P>"Your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects.



<P>You have given us an amusing sketch, and human nature



<P>cannot say it was not so.&nbsp; We must all feel _at_ _times_



<P>the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish;



<P>but if you are supposing it a frequent thing, that is to say,



<P>a weakness grown into a habit from neglect, what could



<P>be expected from the _private_ devotions of such persons?



<P>Do you think the minds which are suffered, which are



<P>indulged in wanderings in a chapel, would be more collected



<P>in a closet?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, very likely.&nbsp; They would have two chances at least



<P>in their favour.&nbsp; There would be less to distract the



<P>attention from without, and it would not be tried so long."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The mind which does not struggle against itself under



<P>_one_ circumstance, would find objects to distract it



<P>in the _other_, I believe; and the influence of the place



<P>and of example may often rouse better feelings than are



<P>begun with.&nbsp; The greater length of the service, however,



<P>I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind.



<P>One wishes it were not so; but I have not yet left



<P>Oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayers are."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While this was passing, the rest of the party being scattered



<P>about the chapel, Julia called Mr. Crawford's attention to



<P>her sister, by saying, "Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria,



<P>standing side by side, exactly as if the ceremony were



<P>going to be performed.&nbsp; Have not they completely the air of it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Crawford smiled his acquiescence, and stepping forward



<P>to Maria, said, in a voice which she only could hear,



<P>"I do not like to see Miss Bertram so near the altar."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Starting, the lady instinctively moved a step or two,



<P>but recovering herself in a moment, affected to laugh,



<P>and asked him, in a tone not much louder, "If he would give



<P>her away?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly," was his reply,



<P>with a look of meaning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Julia, joining them at the moment, carried on the joke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word, it is really a pity that it should not



<P>take place directly, if we had but a proper licence,



<P>for here we are altogether, and nothing in the world



<P>could be more snug and pleasant."&nbsp; And she talked and



<P>laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the



<P>comprehension of Mr. Rushworth and his mother, and expose



<P>her sister to the whispered gallantries of her lover,



<P>while Mrs. Rushworth spoke with proper smiles and dignity



<P>of its being a most happy event to her whenever it took place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If Edmund were but in orders!" cried Julia, and running



<P>to where he stood with Miss Crawford and Fanny:



<P>"My dear Edmund, if you were but in orders now, you might



<P>perform the ceremony directly.&nbsp; How unlucky that you



<P>are not ordained; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford's countenance, as Julia spoke, might have



<P>amused a disinterested observer.&nbsp; She looked almost aghast



<P>under the new idea she was receiving.&nbsp; Fanny pitied her.



<P>"How distressed she will be at what she said just now,"



<P>passed across her mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ordained!" said Miss Crawford; "what, are you to be



<P>a clergyman?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; I shall take orders soon after my father's return--



<P>probably at Christmas."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford, rallying her spirits, and recovering



<P>her complexion, replied only, "If I had known this before,



<P>I would have spoken of the cloth with more respect,"



<P>and turned the subject.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The chapel was soon afterwards left to the silence and stillness



<P>which reigned in it, with few interruptions, throughout the year.



<P>Miss Bertram, displeased with her sister, led the way,



<P>and all seemed to feel that they had been there long enough.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The lower part of the house had been now entirely shewn,



<P>and Mrs. Rushworth, never weary in the cause, would have



<P>proceeded towards the principal staircase, and taken



<P>them through all the rooms above, if her son had not



<P>interposed with a doubt of there being time enough.



<P>"For if," said he, with the sort of self-evident proposition



<P>which many a clearer head does not always avoid, "we are



<P>_too_ long going over the house, we shall not have time



<P>for what is to be done out of doors.&nbsp; It is past two,



<P>and we are to dine at five."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Rushworth submitted; and the question of surveying



<P>the grounds, with the who and the how, was likely to be more



<P>fully agitated, and Mrs. Norris was beginning to arrange



<P>by what junction of carriages and horses most could be done,



<P>when the young people, meeting with an outward door,



<P>temptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately



<P>to turf and shrubs, and all the sweets of pleasure-grounds,



<P>as by one impulse, one wish for air and liberty, all walked out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Suppose we turn down here for the present," said Mrs. Rushworth,



<P>civilly taking the hint and following them.&nbsp; "Here are the



<P>greatest number of our plants, and here are the curious pheasants."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Query," said Mr. Crawford, looking round him,



<P>"whether we may not find something to employ us here



<P>before we go farther?&nbsp; I see walls of great promise.



<P>Mr. Rushworth, shall we summon a council on this lawn?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"James," said Mrs. Rushworth to her son, "I believe



<P>the wilderness will be new to all the party.&nbsp; The Miss



<P>Bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No objection was made, but for some time there seemed



<P>no inclination to move in any plan, or to any distance.



<P>All were attracted at first by the plants or the pheasants,



<P>and all dispersed about in happy independence.



<P>Mr. Crawford was the first to move forward to examine



<P>the capabilities of that end of the house.&nbsp; The lawn,



<P>bounded on each side by a high wall, contained beyond



<P>the first planted area a bowling-green, and beyond



<P>the bowling-green a long terrace walk, backed by iron



<P>palisades, and commanding a view over them into the tops



<P>of the trees of the wilderness immediately adjoining.



<P>It was a good spot for fault-finding. Mr. Crawford was soon



<P>followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth; and when,



<P>after a little time, the others began to form into parties,



<P>these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace



<P>by Edmund, Miss Crawford, and Fanny, who seemed as naturally



<P>to unite, and who, after a short participation of their



<P>regrets and difficulties, left them and walked on.



<P>The remaining three, Mrs. Rushworth, Mrs. Norris,



<P>and Julia, were still far behind; for Julia, whose happy



<P>star no longer prevailed, was obliged to keep by the side



<P>of Mrs. Rushworth, and restrain her impatient feet to that



<P>lady's slow pace, while her aunt, having fallen in with



<P>the housekeeper, who was come out to feed the pheasants,



<P>was lingering behind in gossip with her.&nbsp; Poor Julia,



<P>the only one out of the nine not tolerably satisfied



<P>with their lot, was now in a state of complete penance,



<P>and as different from the Julia of the barouche-box



<P>as could well be imagined.&nbsp; The politeness which she had



<P>been brought up to practise as a duty made it impossible



<P>for her to escape; while the want of that higher species



<P>of self-command, that just consideration of others,



<P>that knowledge of her own heart, that principle of right,



<P>which had not formed any essential part of her education,



<P>made her miserable under it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is insufferably hot," said Miss Crawford, when they



<P>had taken one turn on the terrace, and were drawing



<P>a second time to the door in the middle which opened to



<P>the wilderness.&nbsp; "Shall any of us object to being comfortable?



<P>Here is a nice little wood, if one can but get into it.



<P>What happiness if the door should not be locked! but of



<P>course it is; for in these great places the gardeners



<P>are the only people who can go where they like."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The door, however, proved not to be locked, and they were



<P>all agreed in turning joyfully through it, and leaving



<P>the unmitigated glare of day behind.&nbsp; A considerable



<P>flight of steps landed them in the wilderness, which was



<P>a planted wood of about two acres, and though chiefly



<P>of larch and laurel, and beech cut down, and though laid



<P>out with too much regularity, was darkness and shade,



<P>and natural beauty, compared with the bowling-green



<P>and the terrace.&nbsp; They all felt the refreshment of it,



<P>and for some time could only walk and admire.&nbsp; At length,



<P>after a short pause, Miss Crawford began with, "So you



<P>are to be a clergyman, Mr. Bertram.&nbsp; This is rather



<P>a surprise to me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why should it surprise you?&nbsp; You must suppose me designed



<P>for some profession, and might perceive that I am neither



<P>a lawyer, nor a soldier, nor a sailor."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very true; but, in short, it had not occurred to me.



<P>And you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather



<P>to leave a fortune to the second son."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A very praiseworthy practice," said Edmund,



<P>"but not quite universal.&nbsp; I am one of the exceptions,



<P>and _being_ one, must do something for myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'But why are you to be a clergyman?&nbsp; I thought _that_



<P>was always the lot of the youngest, where there were



<P>many to chuse before him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you think the church itself never chosen, then?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_Never_ is a black word.&nbsp; But yes, in the _never_



<P>of conversation, which means _not_ _very_ _often_,



<P>I do think it.&nbsp; For what is to be done in the church?



<P>Men love to distinguish themselves, and in either of the other



<P>lines distinction may be gained, but not in the church.



<P>A clergyman is nothing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The _nothing_ of conversation has its gradations, I hope,



<P>as well as the _never_.&nbsp; A clergyman cannot be high in



<P>state or fashion.&nbsp; He must not head mobs, or set the ton



<P>in dress.&nbsp; But I cannot call that situation nothing which



<P>has the charge of all that is of the first importance



<P>to mankind, individually or collectively considered,



<P>temporally and eternally, which has the guardianship



<P>of religion and morals, and consequently of the manners



<P>which result from their influence.&nbsp; No one here can call



<P>the _office_ nothing.&nbsp; If the man who holds it is so,



<P>it is by the neglect of his duty, by foregoing its



<P>just importance, and stepping out of his place to appear



<P>what he ought not to appear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_You_ assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one



<P>has been used to hear given, or than I can quite comprehend.



<P>One does not see much of this influence and importance



<P>in society, and how can it be acquired where they are



<P>so seldom seen themselves?&nbsp; How can two sermons a week,



<P>even supposing them worth hearing, supposing the preacher



<P>to have the sense to prefer Blair's to his own, do all



<P>that you speak of? govern the conduct and fashion the



<P>manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week?



<P>One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_You_ are speaking of London, _I_ am speaking of the



<P>nation at large."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The metropolis, I imagine, is a pretty fair sample



<P>of the rest."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not, I should hope, of the proportion of virtue to vice



<P>throughout the kingdom.&nbsp; We do not look in great cities



<P>for our best morality.&nbsp; It is not there that respectable



<P>people of any denomination can do most good; and it



<P>certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can



<P>be most felt.&nbsp; A fine preacher is followed and admired;



<P>but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman



<P>will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood,



<P>where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable



<P>of knowing his private character, and observing his



<P>general conduct, which in London can rarely be the case.



<P>The clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners.



<P>They are known to the largest part only as preachers.



<P>And with regard to their influencing public manners,



<P>Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me, or suppose I mean



<P>to call them the arbiters of good-breeding, the regulators



<P>of refinement and courtesy, the masters of the ceremonies



<P>of life.&nbsp; The _manners_ I speak of might rather be



<P>called _conduct_, perhaps, the result of good principles;



<P>the effect, in short, of those doctrines which it



<P>is their duty to teach and recommend; and it will,



<P>I believe, be everywhere found, that as the clergy are,



<P>or are not what they ought to be, so are the rest of



<P>the nation."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly," said Fanny, with gentle earnestness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There," cried Miss Crawford, "you have quite convinced



<P>Miss Price already."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not think you ever will," said she, with an arch smile;



<P>"I am just as much surprised now as I was at first



<P>that you should intend to take orders.&nbsp; You really are



<P>fit for something better.&nbsp; Come, do change your mind.



<P>It is not too late.&nbsp; Go into the law."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go into the law!&nbsp; With as much ease as I was told to go



<P>into this wilderness."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now you are going to say something about law being



<P>the worst wilderness of the two, but I forestall you;



<P>remember, I have forestalled you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent



<P>my saying a _bon_ _mot_, for there is not the least wit in



<P>my nature.&nbsp; I am a very matter-of-fact, plain-spoken being,



<P>and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half



<P>an hour together without striking it out."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A general silence succeeded.&nbsp; Each was thoughtful.



<P>Fanny made the first interruption by saying, "I wonder



<P>that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood;



<P>but the next time we come to a seat, if it is not disagreeable



<P>to you, I should be glad to sit down for a little while."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Fanny," cried Edmund, immediately drawing her arm



<P>within his, "how thoughtless I have been!&nbsp; I hope you



<P>are not very tired.&nbsp; Perhaps," turning to Miss Crawford,



<P>"my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, but I am not at all tired."&nbsp; She took it,



<P>however, as she spoke, and the gratification of having



<P>her do so, of feeling such a connexion for the first time,



<P>made him a little forgetful of Fanny.&nbsp; "You scarcely



<P>touch me," said he.&nbsp; "You do not make me of any use.



<P>What a difference in the weight of a woman's arm from



<P>that of a man!&nbsp; At Oxford I have been a good deal used



<P>to have a man lean on me for the length of a street,



<P>and you are only a fly in the comparison."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am really not tired, which I almost wonder at;



<P>for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood.



<P>Do not you think we have?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not half a mile," was his sturdy answer; for he was not yet



<P>so much in love as to measure distance, or reckon time,



<P>with feminine lawlessness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! you do not consider how much we have wound about.



<P>We have taken such a very serpentine course, and the wood



<P>itself must be half a mile long in a straight line,



<P>for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left



<P>the first great path."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But if you remember, before we left that first great path,



<P>we saw directly to the end of it.&nbsp; We looked down the



<P>whole vista, and saw it closed by iron gates, and it



<P>could not have been more than a furlong in length."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!&nbsp; I know nothing of your furlongs, but I am sure



<P>it is a very long wood, and that we have been winding



<P>in and out ever since we came into it; and therefore,



<P>when I say that we have walked a mile in it, I must speak



<P>within compass."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We have been exactly a quarter of an hour here,"



<P>said Edmund, taking out his watch.&nbsp; "Do you think we



<P>are walking four miles an hour?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! do not attack me with your watch.&nbsp; A watch is always



<P>too fast or too slow.&nbsp; I cannot be dictated to by a watch."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A few steps farther brought them out at the bottom of the



<P>very walk they had been talking of; and standing back,



<P>well shaded and sheltered, and looking over a ha-ha into



<P>the park, was a comfortable-sized bench, on which they



<P>all sat down.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am afraid you are very tired, Fanny," said Edmund,



<P>observing her; "why would not you speak sooner?&nbsp; This will be



<P>a bad day's amusement for you if you are to be knocked up.



<P>Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon, Miss Crawford,



<P>except riding."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How abominable in you, then, to let me engross her horse



<P>as I did all last week!&nbsp; I am ashamed of you and of myself,



<P>but it shall never happen again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_Your_ attentiveness and consideration makes me more



<P>sensible of my own neglect.&nbsp; Fanny's interest seems



<P>in safer hands with you than with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That she should be tired now, however, gives me no surprise;



<P>for there is nothing in the course of one's duties



<P>so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning:



<P>seeing a great house, dawdling from one room to another,



<P>straining one's eyes and one's attention, hearing what one



<P>does not understand, admiring what one does not care for.



<P>It is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world,



<P>and Miss Price has found it so, though she did not



<P>know it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall soon be rested," said Fanny; "to sit



<P>in the shade on a fine day, and look upon verdure,



<P>is the most perfect refreshment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again.



<P>"I must move," said she; "resting fatigues me.



<P>I have looked across the ha-ha till I am weary.&nbsp; I must



<P>go and look through that iron gate at the same view,



<P>without being able to see it so well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund left the seat likewise.&nbsp; "Now, Miss Crawford,



<P>if you will look up the walk, you will convince yourself



<P>that it cannot be half a mile long, or half half a mile."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is an immense distance," said she; "I see _that_



<P>with a glance."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He still reasoned with her, but in vain.&nbsp; She would



<P>not calculate, she would not compare.&nbsp; She would only



<P>smile and assert.&nbsp; The greatest degree of rational



<P>consistency could not have been more engaging, and they



<P>talked with mutual satisfaction.&nbsp; At last it was agreed



<P>that they should endeavour to determine the dimensions



<P>of the wood by walking a little more about it.&nbsp; They would



<P>go to one end of it, in the line they were then in--



<P>for there was a straight green walk along the bottom



<P>by the side of the ha-ha--and perhaps turn a little way



<P>in some other direction, if it seemed likely to assist them,



<P>and be back in a few minutes.&nbsp; Fanny said she was rested,



<P>and would have moved too, but this was not suffered.



<P>Edmund urged her remaining where she was with an



<P>earnestness which she could not resist, and she was left



<P>on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin's care,



<P>but with great regret that she was not stronger.



<P>She watched them till they had turned the corner,



<P>and listened till all sound of them had ceased.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny



<P>to chuse whether her situation with regard to Crawford



<P>should be mentioned between them or not; and that if she



<P>did not lead the way, it should never be touched on by him;



<P>but after a day or two of mutual reserve, he was induced



<P>by his father to change his mind, and try what his influence



<P>might do for his friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A day, and a very early day, was actually fixed for



<P>the Crawfords' departure; and Sir Thomas thought it



<P>might be as well to make one more effort for the young



<P>man before he left Mansfield, that all his professions



<P>and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much



<P>hope to sustain them as possible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection



<P>of Mr. Crawford's character in that point.&nbsp; He wished him



<P>to be a model of constancy; and fancied the best means



<P>of effecting it would be by not trying him too long.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage



<P>in the business; he wanted to know Fanny's feelings.



<P>She had been used to consult him in every difficulty,



<P>and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her



<P>confidence now; he hoped to be of service to her, he thought



<P>he must be of service to her; whom else had she to open



<P>her heart to?&nbsp; If she did not need counsel, she must need



<P>the comfort of communication.&nbsp; Fanny estranged from him,



<P>silent and reserved, was an unnatural state of things;



<P>a state which he must break through, and which he could



<P>easily learn to think she was wanting him to break through.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will speak to her, sir:&nbsp; I will take the first opportunity



<P>of speaking to her alone," was the result of such thoughts



<P>as these; and upon Sir Thomas's information of her



<P>being at that very time walking alone in the shrubbery,



<P>he instantly joined her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am come to walk with you, Fanny," said he.&nbsp; "Shall I?"



<P>Drawing her arm within his.&nbsp; "It is a long while since we



<P>have had a comfortable walk together."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She assented to it all rather by look than word.



<P>Her spirits were low.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, Fanny," he presently added, "in order to have a



<P>comfortable walk, something more is necessary than merely



<P>pacing this gravel together.&nbsp; You must talk to me.



<P>I know you have something on your mind.&nbsp; I know what you



<P>are thinking of.&nbsp; You cannot suppose me uninformed.



<P>Am I to hear of it from everybody but Fanny herself?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, at once agitated and dejected, replied, "If you



<P>hear of it from everybody, cousin, there can be nothing



<P>for me to tell."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not of facts, perhaps; but of feelings, Fanny.



<P>No one but you can tell me them.&nbsp; I do not mean to



<P>press you, however.&nbsp; If it is not what you wish yourself,



<P>I have done.&nbsp; I had thought it might be a relief."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am afraid we think too differently for me to find



<P>any relief in talking of what I feel."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you suppose that we think differently?&nbsp; I have no idea



<P>of it.&nbsp; I dare say that, on a comparison of our opinions,



<P>they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be:



<P>to the point--I consider Crawford's proposals as most



<P>advantageous and desirable, if you could return his affection.



<P>I consider it as most natural that all your family



<P>should wish you could return it; but that, as you cannot,



<P>you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him.



<P>Can there be any disagreement between us here?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh no!&nbsp; But I thought you blamed me.&nbsp; I thought you



<P>were against me.&nbsp; This is such a comfort!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This comfort you might have had sooner, Fanny, had you



<P>sought it.&nbsp; But how could you possibly suppose me against you?



<P>How could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love?



<P>Were I even careless in general on such matters, how could



<P>you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My uncle thought me wrong, and I knew he had been talking



<P>to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As far as you have gone, Fanny, I think you perfectly right.



<P>I may be sorry, I may be surprised--though hardly _that_,



<P>for you had not had time to attach yourself--but I think



<P>you perfectly right.&nbsp; Can it admit of a question?



<P>It is disgraceful to us if it does.&nbsp; You did not love him;



<P>nothing could have justified your accepting him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So far your conduct has been faultless, and they were quite



<P>mistaken who wished you to do otherwise.&nbsp; But the matter



<P>does not end here.&nbsp; Crawford's is no common attachment;



<P>he perseveres, with the hope of creating that regard



<P>which had not been created before.&nbsp; This, we know,



<P>must be a work of time.&nbsp; But" (with an affectionate smile)



<P>"let him succeed at last, Fanny, let him succeed at last.



<P>You have proved yourself upright and disinterested,



<P>prove yourself grateful and tender-hearted; and then you



<P>will be the perfect model of a woman which I have always



<P>believed you born for."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! never, never, never! he never will succeed with me."



<P>And she spoke with a warmth which quite astonished Edmund,



<P>and which she blushed at the recollection of herself,



<P>when she saw his look, and heard him reply, "Never!&nbsp; Fanny!--



<P>so very determined and positive!&nbsp; This is not like yourself,



<P>your rational self."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I mean," she cried, sorrowfully correcting herself,



<P>"that I _think_ I never shall, as far as the future can



<P>be answered for; I think I never shall return his regard."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I must hope better things.&nbsp; I am aware, more aware



<P>than Crawford can be, that the man who means to make



<P>you love him (you having due notice of his intentions)



<P>must have very uphill work, for there are all your early



<P>attachments and habits in battle array; and before he



<P>can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it



<P>from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate,



<P>which so many years' growth have confirmed, and which are



<P>considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea



<P>of separation.&nbsp; I know that the apprehension of being



<P>forced to quit Mansfield will for a time be arming you



<P>against him.&nbsp; I wish he had not been obliged to tell you



<P>what he was trying for.&nbsp; I wish he had known you as well as



<P>I do, Fanny.&nbsp; Between us, I think we should have won you.



<P>My theoretical and his practical knowledge together could



<P>not have failed.&nbsp; He should have worked upon my plans.



<P>I must hope, however, that time, proving him (as I firmly



<P>believe it will) to deserve you by his steady affection,



<P>will give him his reward.&nbsp; I cannot suppose that you have



<P>not the _wish_ to love him--the natural wish of gratitude.



<P>You must have some feeling of that sort.&nbsp; You must be sorry



<P>for your own indifference."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We are so totally unlike," said Fanny, avoiding a



<P>direct answer, "we are so very, very different in all



<P>our inclinations and ways, that I consider it as quite



<P>impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together,



<P>even if I _could_ like him.&nbsp; There never were two people



<P>more dissimilar.&nbsp; We have not one taste in common.



<P>We should be miserable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are mistaken, Fanny.&nbsp; The dissimilarity is not so strong.



<P>You are quite enough alike.&nbsp; You _have_ tastes in common.



<P>You have moral and literary tastes in common.&nbsp; You have



<P>both warm hearts and benevolent feelings; and, Fanny,



<P>who that heard him read, and saw you listen to Shakespeare



<P>the other night, will think you unfitted as companions?



<P>You forget yourself:&nbsp; there is a decided difference



<P>in your tempers, I allow.&nbsp; He is lively, you are serious;



<P>but so much the better:&nbsp; his spirits will support yours.



<P>It is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy



<P>difficulties greater than they are.&nbsp; His cheerfulness



<P>will counteract this.&nbsp; He sees difficulties nowhere:



<P>and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support



<P>to you.&nbsp; Your being so far unlike, Fanny, does not in



<P>the smallest degree make against the probability of your



<P>happiness together:&nbsp; do not imagine it.&nbsp; I am myself



<P>convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance.



<P>I am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike:



<P>I mean unlike in the flow of the spirits, in the manners,



<P>in the inclination for much or little company, in the



<P>propensity to talk or to be silent, to be grave or to be gay.



<P>Some opposition here is, I am thoroughly convinced,



<P>friendly to matrimonial happiness.&nbsp; I exclude extremes,



<P>of course; and a very close resemblance in all those



<P>points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme.



<P>A counteraction, gentle and continual, is the best safeguard



<P>of manners and conduct."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Full well could Fanny guess where his thoughts were now:



<P>Miss Crawford's power was all returning.&nbsp; He had been



<P>speaking of her cheerfully from the hour of his coming home.



<P>His avoiding her was quite at an end.&nbsp; He had dined at the



<P>Parsonage only the preceding day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes,



<P>Fanny, feeling it due to herself, returned to Mr. Crawford,



<P>and said, "It is not merely in _temper_ that I consider



<P>him as totally unsuited to myself; though, in _that_



<P>respect, I think the difference between us too great,



<P>infinitely too great:&nbsp; his spirits often oppress me;



<P>but there is something in him which I object to still more.



<P>I must say, cousin, that I cannot approve his character.



<P>I have not thought well of him from the time of the play.



<P>I then saw him behaving, as it appeared to me, so very



<P>improperly and unfeelingly--I may speak of it now because



<P>it is all over--so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth,



<P>not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him,



<P>and paying attentions to my cousin Maria, which--in short,



<P>at the time of the play, I received an impression which



<P>will never be got over."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Fanny," replied Edmund, scarcely hearing her



<P>to the end, "let us not, any of us, be judged by what we



<P>appeared at that period of general folly.&nbsp; The time of the



<P>play is a time which I hate to recollect.&nbsp; Maria was wrong,



<P>Crawford was wrong, we were all wrong together; but none



<P>so wrong as myself.&nbsp; Compared with me, all the rest



<P>were blameless.&nbsp; I was playing the fool with my eyes open."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As a bystander," said Fanny, "perhaps I saw more than



<P>you did; and I do think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes



<P>very jealous."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very possibly.&nbsp; No wonder.&nbsp; Nothing could be more improper



<P>than the whole business.&nbsp; I am shocked whenever I think



<P>that Maria could be capable of it; but, if she could



<P>undertake the part, we must not be surprised at the rest."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Before the play, I am much mistaken if _Julia_ did



<P>not think he was paying her attentions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Julia!&nbsp; I have heard before from some one of his being



<P>in love with Julia; but I could never see anything of it.



<P>And, Fanny, though I hope I do justice to my sisters'



<P>good qualities, I think it very possible that they might,



<P>one or both, be more desirous of being admired by Crawford,



<P>and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was



<P>perfectly prudent.&nbsp; I can remember that they were evidently



<P>fond of his society; and with such encouragement, a man



<P>like Crawford, lively, and it may be, a little unthinking,



<P>might be led on to--there could be nothing very striking,



<P>because it is clear that he had no pretensions:&nbsp; his heart



<P>was reserved for you.&nbsp; And I must say, that its being



<P>for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion.



<P>It does him the highest honour; it shews his proper estimation



<P>of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment.



<P>It proves him unspoilt by his uncle.&nbsp; It proves him, in short,



<P>everything that I had been used to wish to believe him,



<P>and feared he was not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am persuaded that he does not think, as he ought,



<P>on serious subjects."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Say, rather, that he has not thought at all upon serious



<P>subjects, which I believe to be a good deal the case.



<P>How could it be otherwise, with such an education and adviser?



<P>Under the disadvantages, indeed, which both have had,



<P>is it not wonderful that they should be what they are?



<P>Crawford's _feelings_, I am ready to acknowledge, have hitherto



<P>been too much his guides.&nbsp; Happily, those feelings have



<P>generally been good.&nbsp; You will supply the rest; and a most



<P>fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature--



<P>to a woman who, firm as a rock in her own principles, has a



<P>gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them.



<P>He has chosen his partner, indeed, with rare felicity.



<P>He will make you happy, Fanny; I know he will make you happy;



<P>but you will make him everything."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I would not engage in such a charge," cried Fanny, in a



<P>shrinking accent; "in such an office of high responsibility!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As usual, believing yourself unequal to anything!



<P>fancying everything too much for you!&nbsp; Well, though I



<P>may not be able to persuade you into different feelings,



<P>you will be persuaded into them, I trust.



<P>I confess myself sincerely anxious that you may.



<P>I have no common interest in Crawford's well-doing. Next



<P>to your happiness, Fanny, his has the first claim on me.



<P>You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was too well aware of it to have anything to say;



<P>and they walked on together some fifty yards in mutual



<P>silence and abstraction.&nbsp; Edmund first began again--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking



<P>of it yesterday, particularly pleased, because I had not



<P>depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light.



<P>I knew she was very fond of you; but yet I was afraid



<P>of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite



<P>as it deserved, and of her regretting that he had not



<P>rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune.



<P>I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims, which she



<P>has been too much used to hear.&nbsp; But it was very different.



<P>She spoke of you, Fanny, just as she ought.&nbsp; She desires



<P>the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself.



<P>We had a long talk about it.&nbsp; I should not have mentioned



<P>the subject, though very anxious to know her sentiments;



<P>but I had not been in the room five minutes before she



<P>began introducing it with all that openness of heart,



<P>and sweet peculiarity of manner, that spirit and ingenuousness



<P>which are so much a part of herself.&nbsp; Mrs. Grant laughed



<P>at her for her rapidity."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Was Mrs. Grant in the room, then?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, when I reached the house I found the two sisters



<P>together by themselves; and when once we had begun,



<P>we had not done with you, Fanny, till Crawford and Dr. Grant



<P>came in."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, she laments it; yet owns it may have been best.



<P>You will see her, however, before she goes.&nbsp; She is very



<P>angry with you, Fanny; you must be prepared for that.



<P>She calls herself very angry, but you can imagine her anger.



<P>It is the regret and disappointment of a sister,



<P>who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may



<P>wish for, at the first moment.&nbsp; She is hurt, as you would



<P>be for William; but she loves and esteems you with all



<P>her heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I knew she would be very angry with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dearest Fanny," cried Edmund, pressing her arm closer



<P>to him, "do not let the idea of her anger distress you.



<P>It is anger to be talked of rather than felt.&nbsp; Her heart



<P>is made for love and kindness, not for resentment.



<P>I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise;



<P>I wish you could have seen her countenance, when she said



<P>that you _should_ be Henry's wife.&nbsp; And I observed that she



<P>always spoke of you as 'Fanny,' which she was never used to do;



<P>and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And Mrs. Grant, did she say--did she speak; was she



<P>there all the time?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, she was agreeing exactly with her sister.&nbsp; The surprise



<P>of your refusal, Fanny, seems to have been unbounded.



<P>That you could refuse such a man as Henry Crawford seems



<P>more than they can understand.&nbsp; I said what I could for you;



<P>but in good truth, as they stated the case--you must



<P>prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can



<P>by a different conduct; nothing else will satisfy them.



<P>But this is teasing you.&nbsp; I have done.&nbsp; Do not turn away



<P>from me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I _should_ have thought," said Fanny, after a pause



<P>of recollection and exertion, "that every woman must



<P>have felt the possibility of a man's not being approved,



<P>not being loved by some one of her sex at least, let him



<P>be ever so generally agreeable.&nbsp; Let him have all the



<P>perfections in the world, I think it ought not to be set



<P>down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every



<P>woman he may happen to like himself.&nbsp; But, even supposing



<P>it is so, allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims



<P>which his sisters think he has, how was I to be prepared



<P>to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own?



<P>He took me wholly by surprise.&nbsp; I had not an idea that



<P>his behaviour to me before had any meaning; and surely I



<P>was not to be teaching myself to like him only because



<P>he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me.



<P>In my situation, it would have been the extreme of vanity



<P>to be forming expectations on Mr. Crawford.&nbsp; I am sure



<P>his sisters, rating him as they do, must have thought it so,



<P>supposing he had meant nothing.&nbsp; How, then, was I to be--



<P>to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me?



<P>How was I to have an attachment at his service, as soon



<P>as it was asked for?&nbsp; His sisters should consider me



<P>as well as him.&nbsp; The higher his deserts, the more improper



<P>for me ever to have thought of him.&nbsp; And, and--we think



<P>very differently of the nature of women, if they can imagine



<P>a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection



<P>as this seems to imply."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear, dear Fanny, now I have the truth.&nbsp; I know this



<P>to be the truth; and most worthy of you are such feelings.



<P>I had attributed them to you before.&nbsp; I thought I could



<P>understand you.&nbsp; You have now given exactly the explanation



<P>which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant,



<P>and they were both better satisfied, though your warm-hearted



<P>friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm



<P>of her fondness for Henry.&nbsp; I told them that you were



<P>of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most



<P>power and novelty least; and that the very circumstance



<P>of the novelty of Crawford's addresses was against him.



<P>Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour;



<P>that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to;



<P>and a great deal more to the same purpose, to give them



<P>a knowledge of your character.&nbsp; Miss Crawford made us



<P>laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother.



<P>She meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being



<P>loved in time, and of having his addresses most kindly



<P>received at the end of about ten years' happy marriage."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny could with difficulty give the smile that was



<P>here asked for.&nbsp; Her feelings were all in revolt.



<P>She feared she had been doing wrong:&nbsp; saying too much,



<P>overacting the caution which she had been fancying necessary;



<P>in guarding against one evil, laying herself open



<P>to another; and to have Miss Crawford's liveliness



<P>repeated to her at such a moment, and on such a subject,



<P>was a bitter aggravation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund saw weariness and distress in her face,



<P>and immediately resolved to forbear all farther discussion;



<P>and not even to mention the name of Crawford again,



<P>except as it might be connected with what _must_ be agreeable



<P>to her.&nbsp; On this principle, he soon afterwards observed--



<P>"They go on Monday.&nbsp; You are sure, therefore, of seeing



<P>your friend either to-morrow or Sunday.&nbsp; They really go



<P>on Monday; and I was within a trifle of being persuaded



<P>to stay at Lessingby till that very day!&nbsp; I had almost



<P>promised it.&nbsp; What a difference it might have made!



<P>Those five or six days more at Lessingby might have been



<P>felt all my life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You were near staying there?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very.&nbsp; I was most kindly pressed, and had nearly consented.



<P>Had I received any letter from Mansfield, to tell me how you



<P>were all going on, I believe I should certainly have staid;



<P>but I knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight,



<P>and felt that I had been away long enough."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You spent your time pleasantly there?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; that is, it was the fault of my own mind if I did not.



<P>They were all very pleasant.&nbsp; I doubt their finding me so.



<P>I took uneasiness with me, and there was no getting rid



<P>of it till I was in Mansfield again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The Miss Owens--you liked them, did not you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, very well.&nbsp; Pleasant, good-humoured, unaffected girls.



<P>But I am spoilt, Fanny, for common female society.



<P>Good-humoured, unaffected girls will not do for a man



<P>who has been used to sensible women.&nbsp; They are two distinct



<P>orders of being.&nbsp; You and Miss Crawford have made me



<P>too nice."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Still, however, Fanny was oppressed and wearied;



<P>he saw it in her looks, it could not be talked away;



<P>and attempting it no more, he led her directly, with the



<P>kind authority of a privileged guardian, into the house.

<B>CHAPTER XXI</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Sir Thomas's return made a striking change in the ways of



<P>the family, independent of Lovers' Vows.&nbsp; Under his government,



<P>Mansfield was an altered place.&nbsp; Some members of their



<P>society sent away, and the spirits of many others saddened--



<P>it was all sameness and gloom compared with the past--



<P>a sombre family party rarely enlivened.&nbsp; There was little



<P>intercourse with the Parsonage.&nbsp; Sir Thomas, drawing back



<P>from intimacies in general, was particularly disinclined,



<P>at this time, for any engagements but in one quarter.



<P>The Rushworths were the only addition to his own domestic



<P>circle which he could solicit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund did not wonder that such should be his father's feelings,



<P>nor could he regret anything but the exclusion of the Grants.



<P>"But they," he observed to Fanny, "have a claim.&nbsp; They seem



<P>to belong to us; they seem to be part of ourselves.



<P>I could wish my father were more sensible of their very



<P>great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away.



<P>I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected.



<P>But the truth is, that my father hardly knows them.



<P>They had not been here a twelvemonth when he left England.



<P>If he knew them better, he would value their society



<P>as it deserves; for they are in fact exactly the sort



<P>of people he would like.&nbsp; We are sometimes a little



<P>in want of animation among ourselves:&nbsp; my sisters seem



<P>out of spirits, and Tom is certainly not at his ease.



<P>Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us, and make our evenings



<P>pass away with more enjoyment even to my father."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you think so?" said Fanny:&nbsp; "in my opinion,



<P>my uncle would not like _any_ addition.&nbsp; I think he



<P>values the very quietness you speak of, and that the



<P>repose of his own family circle is all he wants.



<P>And it does not appear to me that we are more serious



<P>than we used to be--I mean before my uncle went abroad.



<P>As well as I can recollect, it was always much the same.



<P>There was never much laughing in his presence; or,



<P>if there is any difference, it is not more, I think,



<P>than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first.



<P>There must be a sort of shyness; but I cannot recollect



<P>that our evenings formerly were ever merry, except when



<P>my uncle was in town.&nbsp; No young people's are, I suppose,



<P>when those they look up to are at home".

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I believe you are right, Fanny," was his reply, after a



<P>short consideration.&nbsp; "I believe our evenings are rather



<P>returned to what they were, than assuming a new character.



<P>The novelty was in their being lively.&nbsp; Yet, how strong



<P>the impression that only a few weeks will give!



<P>I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I suppose I am graver than other people," said Fanny.



<P>"The evenings do not appear long to me.&nbsp; I love to hear



<P>my uncle talk of the West Indies.&nbsp; I could listen to him



<P>for an hour together.&nbsp; It entertains _me_ more than many



<P>other things have done; but then I am unlike other people,



<P>I dare say."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why should you dare say _that_?" (smiling). "Do you



<P>want to be told that you are only unlike other people



<P>in being more wise and discreet?&nbsp; But when did you,



<P>or anybody, ever get a compliment from me, Fanny?



<P>Go to my father if you want to be complimented.



<P>He will satisfy you.&nbsp; Ask your uncle what he thinks,



<P>and you will hear compliments enough:&nbsp; and though they



<P>may be chiefly on your person, you must put up with it,



<P>and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such language was so new to Fanny that it quite embarrassed her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your uncle thinks you very pretty, dear Fanny--



<P>and that is the long and the short of the matter.



<P>Anybody but myself would have made something more of it,



<P>and anybody but you would resent that you had not been



<P>thought very pretty before; but the truth is, that your



<P>uncle never did admire you till now--and now he does.



<P>Your complexion is so improved!--and you have gained



<P>so much countenance!--and your figure--nay, Fanny, do not



<P>turn away about it--it is but an uncle.&nbsp; If you cannot



<P>bear an uncle's admiration, what is to become of you?



<P>You must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of



<P>being worth looking at.&nbsp; You must try not to mind growing



<P>up into a pretty woman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! don't talk so, don't talk so," cried Fanny,



<P>distressed by more feelings than he was aware of; but seeing



<P>that she was distressed, he had done with the subject,



<P>and only added more seriously--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in



<P>every respect; and I only wish you would talk to him more.



<P>You are one of those who are too silent in the evening circle."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But I do talk to him more than I used.&nbsp; I am sure I do.



<P>Did not you hear me ask him about the slave-trade



<P>last night?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I did--and was in hopes the question would be followed



<P>up by others.&nbsp; It would have pleased your uncle to be



<P>inquired of farther."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I longed to do it--but there was such a dead silence!



<P>And while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word,



<P>or seeming at all interested in the subject, I did not like--



<P>I thought it would appear as if I wanted to set myself



<P>off at their expense, by shewing a curiosity and pleasure



<P>in his information which he must wish his own daughters



<P>to feel."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Crawford was very right in what she said of you



<P>the other day:&nbsp; that you seemed almost as fearful of notice



<P>and praise as other women were of neglect.&nbsp; We were talking



<P>of you at the Parsonage, and those were her words.



<P>She has great discernment.&nbsp; I know nobody who distinguishes



<P>characters better.&nbsp; For so young a woman it is remarkable!



<P>She certainly understands _you_ better than you are



<P>understood by the greater part of those who have known you



<P>so long; and with regard to some others, I can perceive,



<P>from occasional lively hints, the unguarded expressions



<P>of the moment, that she could define _many_ as accurately,



<P>did not delicacy forbid it.&nbsp; I wonder what she thinks



<P>of my father!&nbsp; She must admire him as a fine-looking man,



<P>with most gentlemanlike, dignified, consistent manners;



<P>but perhaps, having seen him so seldom, his reserve



<P>may be a little repulsive.&nbsp; Could they be much together,



<P>I feel sure of their liking each other.&nbsp; He would enjoy



<P>her liveliness and she has talents to value his powers.



<P>I wish they met more frequently!&nbsp; I hope she does not suppose



<P>there is any dislike on his side."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She must know herself too secure of the regard of all



<P>the rest of you," said Fanny, with half a sigh, "to have



<P>any such apprehension.&nbsp; And Sir Thomas's wishing just at



<P>first to be only with his family, is so very natural,



<P>that she can argue nothing from that.&nbsp; After a little while,



<P>I dare say, we shall be meeting again in the same sort



<P>of way, allowing for the difference of the time of year."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is the first October that she has passed in the country



<P>since her infancy.&nbsp; I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham



<P>the country; and November is a still more serious month,



<P>and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very anxious for her



<P>not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny could have said a great deal, but it was safer to



<P>say nothing, and leave untouched all Miss Crawford's resources--



<P>her accomplishments, her spirits, her importance,



<P>her friends, lest it should betray her into any observations



<P>seemingly unhandsome.&nbsp; Miss Crawford's kind opinion



<P>of herself deserved at least a grateful forbearance,



<P>and she began to talk of something else.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To-morrow, I think, my uncle dines at Sotherton, and you



<P>and Mr. Bertram too.&nbsp; We shall be quite a small party at home.



<P>I hope my uncle may continue to like Mr. Rushworth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is impossible, Fanny.&nbsp; He must like him less



<P>after to-morrow's visit, for we shall be five hours



<P>in his company.&nbsp; I should dread the stupidity of the day,



<P>if there were not a much greater evil to follow--



<P>the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas.&nbsp; He cannot much



<P>longer deceive himself.&nbsp; I am sorry for them all, and would



<P>give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In this quarter, indeed, disappointment was impending



<P>over Sir Thomas.&nbsp; Not all his good-will for Mr. Rushworth,



<P>not all Mr. Rushworth's deference for him, could prevent



<P>him from soon discerning some part of the truth--



<P>that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man, as ignorant



<P>in business as in books, with opinions in general unfixed,



<P>and without seeming much aware of it himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had expected a very different son-in-law; and beginning



<P>to feel grave on Maria's account, tried to understand



<P>_her_ feelings.&nbsp; Little observation there was necessary



<P>to tell him that indifference was the most favourable



<P>state they could be in.&nbsp; Her behaviour to Mr. Rushworth



<P>was careless and cold.&nbsp; She could not, did not like him.



<P>Sir Thomas resolved to speak seriously to her.



<P>Advantageous as would be the alliance, and long standing



<P>and public as was the engagement, her happiness must not be



<P>sacrificed to it.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth had, perhaps, been accepted



<P>on too short an acquaintance, and, on knowing him better,



<P>she was repenting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her:&nbsp; told her



<P>his fears, inquired into her wishes, entreated her to be



<P>open and sincere, and assured her that every inconvenience



<P>should be braved, and the connexion entirely given up,



<P>if she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it.



<P>He would act for her and release her.&nbsp; Maria had a moment's



<P>struggle as she listened, and only a moment's: when her



<P>father ceased, she was able to give her answer immediately,



<P>decidedly, and with no apparent agitation.&nbsp; She thanked



<P>him for his great attention, his paternal kindness, but he



<P>was quite mistaken in supposing she had the smallest desire



<P>of breaking through her engagement, or was sensible of any



<P>change of opinion or inclination since her forming it.



<P>She had the highest esteem for Mr. Rushworth's character



<P>and disposition, and could not have a doubt of her happiness with



<P>him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas was satisfied; too glad to be satisfied,



<P>perhaps, to urge the matter quite so far as his judgment



<P>might have dictated to others.&nbsp; It was an alliance which



<P>he could not have relinquished without pain; and thus



<P>he reasoned.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth was young enough to improve.



<P>Mr. Rushworth must and would improve in good society;



<P>and if Maria could now speak so securely of her happiness



<P>with him, speaking certainly without the prejudice,



<P>the blindness of love, she ought to be believed.



<P>Her feelings, probably, were not acute; he had never



<P>supposed them to be so; but her comforts might not



<P>be less on that account; and if she could dispense



<P>with seeing her husband a leading, shining character,



<P>there would certainly be everything else in her favour.



<P>A well-disposed young woman, who did not marry for love,



<P>was in general but the more attached to her own family;



<P>and the nearness of Sotherton to Mansfield must naturally hold



<P>out the greatest temptation, and would, in all probability,



<P>be a continual supply of the most amiable and innocent enjoyments.



<P>Such and such-like were the reasonings of Sir Thomas,



<P>happy to escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture,



<P>the wonder, the reflections, the reproach that must



<P>attend it; happy to secure a marriage which would bring



<P>him such an addition of respectability and influence,



<P>and very happy to think anything of his daughter's



<P>disposition that was most favourable for the purpose.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To her the conference closed as satisfactorily as to him.



<P>She was in a state of mind to be glad that she had secured



<P>her fate beyond recall:&nbsp; that she had pledged herself



<P>anew to Sotherton; that she was safe from the possibility



<P>of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her actions,



<P>and destroying her prospects; and retired in proud resolve,



<P>determined only to behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth



<P>in future, that her father might not be again suspecting her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Had Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first



<P>three or four days after Henry Crawford's leaving Mansfield,



<P>before her feelings were at all tranquillised, before she



<P>had given up every hope of him, or absolutely resolved on



<P>enduring his rival, her answer might have been different;



<P>but after another three or four days, when there was no return,



<P>no letter, no message, no symptom of a softened heart,



<P>no hope of advantage from separation, her mind became



<P>cool enough to seek all the comfort that pride and self



<P>revenge could give.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Henry Crawford had destroyed her happiness, but he



<P>should not know that he had done it; he should not



<P>destroy her credit, her appearance, her prosperity, too.



<P>He should not have to think of her as pining in the



<P>retirement of Mansfield for _him_, rejecting Sotherton



<P>and London, independence and splendour, for _his_ sake.



<P>Independence was more needful than ever; the want of it



<P>at Mansfield more sensibly felt.&nbsp; She was less and less



<P>able to endure the restraint which her father imposed.



<P>The liberty which his absence had given was now become



<P>absolutely necessary.&nbsp; She must escape from him and Mansfield



<P>as soon as possible, and find consolation in fortune



<P>and consequence, bustle and the world, for a wounded spirit.



<P>Her mind was quite determined, and varied not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To such feelings delay, even the delay of much preparation,



<P>would have been an evil, and Mr. Rushworth could hardly



<P>be more impatient for the marriage than herself.



<P>In all the important preparations of the mind she



<P>was complete:&nbsp; being prepared for matrimony by an hatred



<P>of home, restraint, and tranquillity; by the misery



<P>of disappointed affection, and contempt of the man she



<P>was to marry.&nbsp; The rest might wait.&nbsp; The preparations



<P>of new carriages and furniture might wait for London



<P>and spring, when her own taste could have fairer play.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The principals being all agreed in this respect, it soon



<P>appeared that a very few weeks would be sufficient



<P>for such arrangements as must precede the wedding.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire, and make way for



<P>the fortunate young woman whom her dear son had selected;



<P>and very early in November removed herself, her maid,



<P>her footman, and her chariot, with true dowager propriety,



<P>to Bath, there to parade over the wonders of Sotherton



<P>in her evening parties; enjoying them as thoroughly,



<P>perhaps, in the animation of a card-table, as she had



<P>ever done on the spot; and before the middle of the same



<P>month the ceremony had taken place which gave Sotherton



<P>another mistress.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a very proper wedding.&nbsp; The bride was elegantly dressed;



<P>the two bridesmaids were duly inferior; her father gave



<P>her away; her mother stood with salts in her hand,



<P>expecting to be agitated; her aunt tried to cry;



<P>and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant.



<P>Nothing could be objected to when it came under the



<P>discussion of the neighbourhood, except that the carriage



<P>which conveyed the bride and bridegroom and Julia



<P>from the church-door to Sotherton was the same chaise



<P>which Mr. Rushworth had used for a twelvemonth before.



<P>In everything else the etiquette of the day might stand



<P>the strictest investigation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was done, and they were gone.&nbsp; Sir Thomas felt as an



<P>anxious father must feel, and was indeed experiencing much



<P>of the agitation which his wife had been apprehensive



<P>of for herself, but had fortunately escaped.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris,



<P>most happy to assist in the duties of the day,



<P>by spending it at the Park to support her sister's spirits,



<P>and drinking the health of Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth in



<P>a supernumerary glass or two, was all joyous delight;



<P>for she had made the match; she had done everything;



<P>and no one would have supposed, from her confident triumph,



<P>that she had ever heard of conjugal infelicity in her life,



<P>or could have the smallest insight into the disposition



<P>of the niece who had been brought up under her eye.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The plan of the young couple was to proceed,



<P>after a few days, to Brighton, and take a house there



<P>for some weeks.&nbsp; Every public place was new to Maria,



<P>and Brighton is almost as gay in winter as in summer.



<P>When the novelty of amusement there was over, it would



<P>be time for the wider range of London.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Julia was to go with them to Brighton.&nbsp; Since rivalry



<P>between the sisters had ceased, they had been gradually



<P>recovering much of their former good understanding;



<P>and were at least sufficiently friends to make each of them



<P>exceedingly glad to be with the other at such a time.



<P>Some other companion than Mr. Rushworth was of the first



<P>consequence to his lady; and Julia was quite as eager



<P>for novelty and pleasure as Maria, though she might not



<P>have struggled through so much to obtain them, and could



<P>better bear a subordinate situation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their departure made another material change at Mansfield,



<P>a chasm which required some time to fill up.&nbsp; The family



<P>circle became greatly contracted; and though the Miss



<P>Bertrams had latterly added little to its gaiety,



<P>they could not but be missed.&nbsp; Even their mother missed them;



<P>and how much more their tenderhearted cousin, who wandered

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>How is the consternation of the party to be described?



<P>To the greater number it was a moment of absolute horror.



<P>Sir Thomas in the house!&nbsp; All felt the instantaneous conviction.



<P>Not a hope of imposition or mistake was harboured anywhere.



<P>Julia's looks were an evidence of the fact that made



<P>it indisputable; and after the first starts and exclamations,



<P>not a word was spoken for half a minute:&nbsp; each with



<P>an altered countenance was looking at some other,



<P>and almost each was feeling it a stroke the most unwelcome,



<P>most ill-timed, most appalling!&nbsp; Mr. Yates might consider



<P>it only as a vexatious interruption for the evening,



<P>and Mr. Rushworth might imagine it a blessing; but every



<P>other heart was sinking under some degree of self-condemnation



<P>or undefined alarm, every other heart was suggesting,



<P>"What will become of us? what is to be done now?"



<P>It was a terrible pause; and terrible to every ear were the



<P>corroborating sounds of opening doors and passing footsteps.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Julia was the first to move and speak again.&nbsp; Jealousy and



<P>bitterness had been suspended:&nbsp; selfishness was lost



<P>in the common cause; but at the moment of her appearance,



<P>Frederick was listening with looks of devotion to



<P>Agatha's narrative, and pressing her hand to his heart;



<P>and as soon as she could notice this, and see that,



<P>in spite of the shock of her words, he still kept his



<P>station and retained her sister's hand, her wounded



<P>heart swelled again with injury, and looking as red



<P>as she had been white before, she turned out of the room,



<P>saying, "_I_ need not be afraid of appearing before him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her going roused the rest; and at the same moment



<P>the two brothers stepped forward, feeling the necessity



<P>of doing something.&nbsp; A very few words between them



<P>were sufficient.&nbsp; The case admitted no difference



<P>of opinion:&nbsp; they must go to the drawing-room directly.



<P>Maria joined them with the same intent, just then the



<P>stoutest of the three; for the very circumstance which



<P>had driven Julia away was to her the sweetest support.



<P>Henry Crawford's retaining her hand at such a moment,



<P>a moment of such peculiar proof and importance,



<P>was worth ages of doubt and anxiety.&nbsp; She hailed it



<P>as an earnest of the most serious determination, and was



<P>equal even to encounter her father.&nbsp; They walked off,



<P>utterly heedless of Mr. Rushworth's repeated question of,



<P>"Shall I go too?&nbsp; Had not I better go too?&nbsp; Will not it



<P>be right for me to go too?" but they were no sooner



<P>through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer



<P>the anxious inquiry, and, encouraging him by all means



<P>to pay his respects to Sir Thomas without delay,



<P>sent him after the others with delighted haste.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates.



<P>She had been quite overlooked by her cousins; and as her



<P>own opinion of her claims on Sir Thomas's affection



<P>was much too humble to give her any idea of classing



<P>herself with his children, she was glad to remain



<P>behind and gain a little breathing-time. Her agitation



<P>and alarm exceeded all that was endured by the rest,



<P>by the right of a disposition which not even innocence



<P>could keep from suffering.&nbsp; She was nearly fainting:



<P>all her former habitual dread of her uncle was returning,



<P>and with it compassion for him and for almost every one



<P>of the party on the development before him, with solicitude



<P>on Edmund's account indescribable.&nbsp; She had found a seat,



<P>where in excessive trembling she was enduring all these



<P>fearful thoughts, while the other three, no longer under



<P>any restraint, were giving vent to their feelings of vexation,



<P>lamenting over such an unlooked-for premature arrival



<P>as a most untoward event, and without mercy wishing



<P>poor Sir Thomas had been twice as long on his passage,



<P>or were still in Antigua.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates,



<P>from better understanding the family, and judging more



<P>clearly of the mischief that must ensue.&nbsp; The ruin of



<P>the play was to them a certainty:&nbsp; they felt the total



<P>destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand;



<P>while Mr. Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption,



<P>a disaster for the evening, and could even suggest the



<P>possibility of the rehearsal being renewed after tea,



<P>when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over,



<P>and he might be at leisure to be amused by it.



<P>The Crawfords laughed at the idea; and having soon



<P>agreed on the propriety of their walking quietly home



<P>and leaving the family to themselves, proposed Mr. Yates's



<P>accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage.



<P>But Mr. Yates, having never been with those who thought much



<P>of parental claims, or family confidence, could not perceive



<P>that anything of the kind was necessary; and therefore,



<P>thanking them, said, "he preferred remaining where he was,



<P>that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman



<P>handsomely since he _was_ come; and besides, he did not



<P>think it would be fair by the others to have everybody run away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was just beginning to collect herself,



<P>and to feel that if she staid longer behind it might



<P>seem disrespectful, when this point was settled, and being



<P>commissioned with the brother and sister's apology,



<P>saw them preparing to go as she quitted the room herself



<P>to perform the dreadful duty of appearing before her uncle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Too soon did she find herself at the drawing-room door;



<P>and after pausing a moment for what she knew would not come,



<P>for a courage which the outside of no door had ever supplied



<P>to her, she turned the lock in desperation, and the lights



<P>of the drawing-room, and all the collected family,



<P>were before her.&nbsp; As she entered, her own name caught



<P>her ear.&nbsp; Sir Thomas was at that moment looking round him,



<P>and saying, "But where is Fanny?&nbsp; Why do not I see



<P>my little Fanny?"--and on perceiving her, came forward



<P>with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her,



<P>calling her his dear Fanny, kissing her affectionately,



<P>and observing with decided pleasure how much she was grown!



<P>Fanny knew not how to feel, nor where to look.&nbsp; She was



<P>quite oppressed.&nbsp; He had never been so kind, so _very_



<P>kind to her in his life.&nbsp; His manner seemed changed,



<P>his voice was quick from the agitation of joy; and all that



<P>had been awful in his dignity seemed lost in tenderness.



<P>He led her nearer the light and looked at her again--



<P>inquired particularly after her health, and then,



<P>correcting himself, observed that he need not inquire,



<P>for her appearance spoke sufficiently on that point.&nbsp; A fine



<P>blush having succeeded the previous paleness of her face,



<P>he was justified in his belief of her equal improvement



<P>in health and beauty.&nbsp; He inquired next after her family,



<P>especially William:&nbsp; and his kindness altogether was such



<P>as made her reproach herself for loving him so little,



<P>and thinking his return a misfortune; and when, on having



<P>courage to lift her eyes to his face, she saw that he



<P>was grown thinner, and had the burnt, fagged, worn look



<P>of fatigue and a hot climate, every tender feeling



<P>was increased, and she was miserable in considering



<P>how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst



<P>on him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas was indeed the life of the party, who at



<P>his suggestion now seated themselves round the fire.



<P>He had the best right to be the talker; and the delight



<P>of his sensations in being again in his own house,



<P>in the centre of his family, after such a separation,



<P>made him communicative and chatty in a very unusual degree;



<P>and he was ready to give every information as to his voyage,



<P>and answer every question of his two sons almost before



<P>it was put.&nbsp; His business in Antigua had latterly been



<P>prosperously rapid, and he came directly from Liverpool,



<P>having had an opportunity of making his passage thither



<P>in a private vessel, instead of waiting for the packet;



<P>and all the little particulars of his proceedings and events,



<P>his arrivals and departures, were most promptly delivered,



<P>as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with heartfelt



<P>satisfaction on the faces around him--interrupting himself



<P>more than once, however, to remark on his good fortune



<P>in finding them all at home--coming unexpectedly as he did--



<P>all collected together exactly as he could have wished,



<P>but dared not depend on.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth was not forgotten:



<P>a most friendly reception and warmth of hand-shaking



<P>had already met him, and with pointed attention he was



<P>now included in the objects most intimately connected



<P>with Mansfield.&nbsp; There was nothing disagreeable in



<P>Mr. Rushworth's appearance, and Sir Thomas was liking



<P>him already.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken,



<P>unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife, who was really



<P>extremely happy to see him, and whose feelings were



<P>so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her nearer



<P>agitation than she had been for the last twenty years.



<P>She had been _almost_ fluttered for a few minutes,



<P>and still remained so sensibly animated as to put away



<P>her work, move Pug from her side, and give all her



<P>attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband.



<P>She had no anxieties for anybody to cloud _her_ pleasure:



<P>her own time had been irreproachably spent during his absence:



<P>she had done a great deal of carpet-work, and made many



<P>yards of fringe; and she would have answered as freely



<P>for the good conduct and useful pursuits of all the young



<P>people as for her own.&nbsp; It was so agreeable to her to see



<P>him again, and hear him talk, to have her ear amused



<P>and her whole comprehension filled by his narratives,



<P>that she began particularly to feel how dreadfully she



<P>must have missed him, and how impossible it would have



<P>been for her to bear a lengthened absence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness



<P>to her sister.&nbsp; Not that _she_ was incommoded by many



<P>fears of Sir Thomas's disapprobation when the present



<P>state of his house should be known, for her judgment



<P>had been so blinded that, except by the instinctive



<P>caution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth's



<P>pink satin cloak as her brother-in-law entered,



<P>she could hardly be said to shew any sign of alarm;



<P>but she was vexed by the _manner_ of his return.



<P>It had left her nothing to do.&nbsp; Instead of being sent



<P>for out of the room, and seeing him first, and having



<P>to spread the happy news through the house, Sir Thomas,



<P>with a very reasonable dependence, perhaps, on the nerves



<P>of his wife and children, had sought no confidant but



<P>the butler, and had been following him almost instantaneously



<P>into the drawing-room. Mrs. Norris felt herself defrauded



<P>of an office on which she had always depended, whether his



<P>arrival or his death were to be the thing unfolded;



<P>and was now trying to be in a bustle without having



<P>anything to bustle about, and labouring to be important



<P>where nothing was wanted but tranquillity and silence.



<P>Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat, she might have gone



<P>to the housekeeper with troublesome directions, and insulted



<P>the footmen with injunctions of despatch; but Sir Thomas



<P>resolutely declined all dinner:&nbsp; he would take nothing,



<P>nothing till tea came--he would rather wait for tea.



<P>Still Mrs. Norris was at intervals urging something different;



<P>and in the most interesting moment of his passage to England,



<P>when the alarm of a French privateer was at the height,



<P>she burst through his recital with the proposal of soup.



<P>"Sure, my dear Sir Thomas, a basin of soup would be



<P>a much better thing for you than tea.&nbsp; Do have a basin



<P>of soup."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas could not be provoked.&nbsp; "Still the same



<P>anxiety for everybody's comfort, my dear Mrs. Norris,"



<P>was his answer.&nbsp; "But indeed I would rather have nothing



<P>but tea."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, then, Lady Bertram, suppose you speak for



<P>tea directly; suppose you hurry Baddeley a little;



<P>he seems behindhand to-night." She carried this point,



<P>and Sir Thomas's narrative proceeded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At length there was a pause.&nbsp; His immediate communications



<P>were exhausted, and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully



<P>around him, now at one, now at another of the beloved circle;



<P>but the pause was not long:&nbsp; in the elation of her



<P>spirits Lady Bertram became talkative, and what were



<P>the sensations of her children upon hearing her say,



<P>"How do you think the young people have been amusing



<P>themselves lately, Sir Thomas?&nbsp; They have been acting.



<P>We have been all alive with acting."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed! and what have you been acting?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! they'll tell you all about it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The _all_ will soon be told," cried Tom hastily,



<P>and with affected unconcern; "but it is not worth



<P>while to bore my father with it now.&nbsp; You will hear



<P>enough of it to-morrow, sir.&nbsp; We have just been trying,



<P>by way of doing something, and amusing my mother,



<P>just within the last week, to get up a few scenes,



<P>a mere trifle.&nbsp; We have had such incessant rains almost



<P>since October began, that we have been nearly confined



<P>to the house for days together.&nbsp; I have hardly taken out



<P>a gun since the 3rd.&nbsp; Tolerable sport the first three days,



<P>but there has been no attempting anything since.



<P>The first day I went over Mansfield Wood, and Edmund took



<P>the copses beyond Easton, and we brought home six brace



<P>between us, and might each have killed six times as many,



<P>but we respect your pheasants, sir, I assure you,



<P>as much as you could desire.&nbsp; I do not think you will find



<P>your woods by any means worse stocked than they were.



<P>_I_ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my



<P>life as this year.&nbsp; I hope you will take a day's sport



<P>there yourself, sir, soon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the present the danger was over, and Fanny's sick



<P>feelings subsided; but when tea was soon afterwards



<P>brought in, and Sir Thomas, getting up, said that he found



<P>that he could not be any longer in the house without



<P>just looking into his own dear room, every agitation



<P>was returning.&nbsp; He was gone before anything had been



<P>said to prepare him for the change he must find there;



<P>and a pause of alarm followed his disappearance.



<P>Edmund was the first to speak--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Something must be done," said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is time to think of our visitors," said Maria,



<P>still feeling her hand pressed to Henry Crawford's heart,



<P>and caring little for anything else.&nbsp; "Where did you leave



<P>Miss Crawford, Fanny?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny told of their departure, and delivered their message.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then poor Yates is all alone," cried Tom.&nbsp; "I will go



<P>and fetch him.&nbsp; He will be no bad assistant when it



<P>all comes out."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To the theatre he went, and reached it just in time to



<P>witness the first meeting of his father and his friend.



<P>Sir Thomas had been a good deal surprised to find candles



<P>burning in his room; and on casting his eye round it,



<P>to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general



<P>air of confusion in the furniture.&nbsp; The removal of the



<P>bookcase from before the billiard-room door struck



<P>him especially, but he had scarcely more than time



<P>to feel astonished at all this, before there were sounds



<P>from the billiard-room to astonish him still farther.



<P>Some one was talking there in a very loud accent; he did



<P>not know the voice--more than talking--almost hallooing.



<P>He stepped to the door, rejoicing at that moment in having



<P>the means of immediate communication, and, opening it,



<P>found himself on the stage of a theatre, and opposed



<P>to a ranting young man, who appeared likely to knock him



<P>down backwards.&nbsp; At the very moment of Yates perceiving



<P>Sir Thomas, and giving perhaps the very best start he



<P>had ever given in the whole course of his rehearsals,



<P>Tom Bertram entered at the other end of the room;



<P>and never had he found greater difficulty in keeping



<P>his countenance.&nbsp; His father's looks of solemnity and



<P>amazement on this his first appearance on any stage,



<P>and the gradual metamorphosis of the impassioned Baron



<P>Wildenheim into the well-bred and easy Mr. Yates,



<P>making his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram, was such



<P>an exhibition, such a piece of true acting, as he would



<P>not have lost upon any account.&nbsp; It would be the last--



<P>in all probability--the last scene on that stage; but he



<P>was sure there could not be a finer.&nbsp; The house would



<P>close with the greatest eclat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was little time, however, for the indulgence



<P>of any images of merriment.&nbsp; It was necessary for him



<P>to step forward, too, and assist the introduction,



<P>and with many awkward sensations he did his best.



<P>Sir Thomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance



<P>of cordiality which was due to his own character,



<P>but was really as far from pleased with the necessity of



<P>the acquaintance as with the manner of its commencement.



<P>Mr. Yates's family and connexions were sufficiently known



<P>to him to render his introduction as the "particular friend,"



<P>another of the hundred particular friends of his son,



<P>exceedingly unwelcome; and it needed all the felicity of being



<P>again at home, and all the forbearance it could supply,



<P>to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding himself thus



<P>bewildered in his own house, making part of a ridiculous



<P>exhibition in the midst of theatrical nonsense, and forced



<P>in so untoward a moment to admit the acquaintance of a young



<P>man whom he felt sure of disapproving, and whose easy



<P>indifference and volubility in the course of the first



<P>five minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of the two.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Tom understood his father's thoughts, and heartily



<P>wishing he might be always as well disposed to give them



<P>but partial expression, began to see, more clearly than



<P>he had ever done before, that there might be some ground



<P>of offence, that there might be some reason for the glance



<P>his father gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room;



<P>and that when he inquired with mild gravity after the fate



<P>of the billiard-table, he was not proceeding beyond



<P>a very allowable curiosity.&nbsp; A few minutes were enough



<P>for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side; and Sir



<P>Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few



<P>words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal



<P>of Mr. Yates, as to the happiness of the arrangement,



<P>the three gentlemen returned to the drawing-room together,



<P>Sir Thomas with an increase of gravity which was not



<P>lost on all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I come from your theatre," said he composedly, as he



<P>sat down; "I found myself in it rather unexpectedly.



<P>Its vicinity to my own room--but in every respect, indeed,



<P>it took me by surprise, as I had not the smallest suspicion



<P>of your acting having assumed so serious a character.



<P>It appears a neat job, however, as far as I could judge



<P>by candlelight, and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit."



<P>And then he would have changed the subject, and sipped



<P>his coffee in peace over domestic matters of a calmer hue;



<P>but Mr. Yates, without discernment to catch Sir Thomas's meaning,



<P>or diffidence, or delicacy, or discretion enough to allow



<P>him to lead the discourse while he mingled among the others



<P>with the least obtrusiveness himself, would keep him on



<P>the topic of the theatre, would torment him with questions



<P>and remarks relative to it, and finally would make him hear



<P>the whole history of his disappointment at Ecclesford.



<P>Sir Thomas listened most politely, but found much to



<P>offend his ideas of decorum, and confirm his ill-opinion



<P>of Mr. Yates's habits of thinking, from the beginning



<P>to the end of the story; and when it was over, could give



<P>him no other assurance of sympathy than what a slight bow conveyed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This was, in fact, the origin of _our_ acting," said Tom,



<P>after a moment's thought.&nbsp; "My friend Yates brought the



<P>infection from Ecclesford, and it spread--as those things



<P>always spread, you know, sir--the faster, probably,



<P>from _your_ having so often encouraged the sort of thing



<P>in us formerly.&nbsp; It was like treading old ground again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Yates took the subject from his friend as soon as possible,



<P>and immediately gave Sir Thomas an account of what they



<P>had done and were doing:&nbsp; told him of the gradual



<P>increase of their views, the happy conclusion of their



<P>first difficulties, and present promising state of affairs;



<P>relating everything with so blind an interest as made him



<P>not only totally unconscious of the uneasy movements of many



<P>of his friends as they sat, the change of countenance,



<P>the fidget, the hem! of unquietness, but prevented him



<P>even from seeing the expression of the face on which his



<P>own eyes were fixed--from seeing Sir Thomas's dark brow



<P>contract as he looked with inquiring earnestness at his



<P>daughters and Edmund, dwelling particularly on the latter,



<P>and speaking a language, a remonstrance, a reproof,



<P>which _he_ felt at his heart.&nbsp; Not less acutely was it



<P>felt by Fanny, who had edged back her chair behind her



<P>aunt's end of the sofa, and, screened from notice herself,



<P>saw all that was passing before her.&nbsp; Such a look



<P>of reproach at Edmund from his father she could never



<P>have expected to witness; and to feel that it was in any



<P>degree deserved was an aggravation indeed.&nbsp; Sir Thomas's



<P>look implied, "On your judgment, Edmund, I depended;



<P>what have you been about?"&nbsp; She knelt in spirit to her uncle,



<P>and her bosom swelled to utter, "Oh, not to _him_!



<P>Look so to all the others, but not to _him_!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Yates was still talking.&nbsp; "To own the truth, Sir Thomas,



<P>we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived



<P>this evening.&nbsp; We were going through the three first acts,



<P>and not unsuccessfully upon the whole.&nbsp; Our company is



<P>now so dispersed, from the Crawfords being gone home,



<P>that nothing more can be done to-night; but if you will



<P>give us the honour of your company to-morrow evening,



<P>I should not be afraid of the result.&nbsp; We bespeak



<P>your indulgence, you understand, as young performers;



<P>we bespeak your indulgence."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My indulgence shall be given, sir," replied Sir



<P>Thomas gravely, "but without any other rehearsal."



<P>And with a relenting smile, he added, "I come home



<P>to be happy and indulgent."&nbsp; Then turning away towards



<P>any or all of the rest, he tranquilly said, "Mr. and Miss



<P>Crawford were mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield.



<P>Do you find them agreeable acquaintance?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Tom was the only one at all ready with an answer, but he



<P>being entirely without particular regard for either,



<P>without jealousy either in love or acting, could speak



<P>very handsomely of both.&nbsp; "Mr. Crawford was a most pleasant,



<P>gentleman-like man; his sister a sweet, pretty, elegant,



<P>lively girl."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Rushworth could be silent no longer.&nbsp; "I do not say



<P>he is not gentleman-like, considering; but you should



<P>tell your father he is not above five feet eight,



<P>or he will be expecting a well-looking man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas did not quite understand this, and looked



<P>with some surprise at the speaker.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I must say what I think," continued Mr. Rushworth, "in my



<P>opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing.



<P>It is having too much of a good thing.&nbsp; I am not so fond



<P>of acting as I was at first.&nbsp; I think we are a great deal



<P>better employed, sitting comfortably here among ourselves,



<P>and doing nothing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas looked again, and then replied with an approving



<P>smile, "I am happy to find our sentiments on this subject



<P>so much the same.&nbsp; It gives me sincere satisfaction.



<P>That I should be cautious and quick-sighted, and feel many



<P>scruples which my children do _not_ feel, is perfectly natural;



<P>and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity,



<P>for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures, should much



<P>exceed theirs.&nbsp; But at your time of life to feel all this,



<P>is a most favourable circumstance for yourself,



<P>and for everybody connected with you; and I am sensible



<P>of the importance of having an ally of such weight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas meant to be giving Mr. Rushworth's opinion



<P>in better words than he could find himself.&nbsp; He was



<P>aware that he must not expect a genius in Mr. Rushworth;



<P>but as a well-judging, steady young man, with better notions



<P>than his elocution would do justice to, he intended to value



<P>him very highly.&nbsp; It was impossible for many of the others



<P>not to smile.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth hardly knew what to do



<P>with so much meaning; but by looking, as he really felt,



<P>most exceedingly pleased with Sir Thomas's good opinion,



<P>and saying scarcely anything, he did his best towards



<P>preserving that good opinion a little longer.

<B>CHAPTER XXV</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The intercourse of the two families was at this period



<P>more nearly restored to what it had been in the autumn,



<P>than any member of the old intimacy had thought ever



<P>likely to be again.&nbsp; The return of Henry Crawford,



<P>and the arrival of William Price, had much to do with it,



<P>but much was still owing to Sir Thomas's more than toleration



<P>of the neighbourly attempts at the Parsonage.&nbsp; His mind,



<P>now disengaged from the cares which had pressed on him



<P>at first, was at leisure to find the Grants and their



<P>young inmates really worth visiting; and though infinitely



<P>above scheming or contriving for any the most advantageous



<P>matrimonial establishment that could be among the apparent



<P>possibilities of any one most dear to him, and disdaining



<P>even as a littleness the being quick-sighted on such points,



<P>he could not avoid perceiving, in a grand and careless way,



<P>that Mr. Crawford was somewhat distinguishing his niece--



<P>nor perhaps refrain (though unconsciously) from giving a



<P>more willing assent to invitations on that account.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His readiness, however, in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage,



<P>when the general invitation was at last hazarded,



<P>after many debates and many doubts as to whether it were



<P>worth while, "because Sir Thomas seemed so ill inclined,



<P>and Lady Bertram was so indolent!" proceeded from



<P>good-breeding and goodwill alone, and had nothing to do



<P>with Mr. Crawford, but as being one in an agreeable group:



<P>for it was in the course of that very visit that he first



<P>began to think that any one in the habit of such idle



<P>observations _would_ _have_ _thought_ that Mr. Crawford



<P>was the admirer of Fanny Price.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The meeting was generally felt to be a pleasant one,



<P>being composed in a good proportion of those who would talk



<P>and those who would listen; and the dinner itself was elegant



<P>and plentiful, according to the usual style of the Grants,



<P>and too much according to the usual habits of all to raise



<P>any emotion except in Mrs. Norris, who could never behold



<P>either the wide table or the number of dishes on it



<P>with patience, and who did always contrive to experience



<P>some evil from the passing of the servants behind her chair,



<P>and to bring away some fresh conviction of its being



<P>impossible among so many dishes but that some must be cold.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the evening it was found, according to the predetermination



<P>of Mrs. Grant and her sister, that after making up



<P>the whist-table there would remain sufficient for a



<P>round game, and everybody being as perfectly complying



<P>and without a choice as on such occasions they always are,



<P>speculation was decided on almost as soon as whist;



<P>and Lady Bertram soon found herself in the critical situation



<P>of being applied to for her own choice between the games,



<P>and being required either to draw a card for whist or not.



<P>She hesitated.&nbsp; Luckily Sir Thomas was at hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What shall I do, Sir Thomas?&nbsp; Whist and speculation;



<P>which will amuse me most?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas, after a moment's thought, recommended speculation.



<P>He was a whist player himself, and perhaps might feel



<P>that it would not much amuse him to have her for a partner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well," was her ladyship's contented answer;



<P>"then speculation, if you please, Mrs. Grant.&nbsp; I know



<P>nothing about it, but Fanny must teach me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here Fanny interposed, however, with anxious protestations



<P>of her own equal ignorance; she had never played the



<P>game nor seen it played in her life; and Lady Bertram



<P>felt a moment's indecision again; but upon everybody's



<P>assuring her that nothing could be so easy, that it



<P>was the easiest game on the cards, and Henry Crawford's



<P>stepping forward with a most earnest request to be allowed



<P>to sit between her ladyship and Miss Price, and teach



<P>them both, it was so settled; and Sir Thomas, Mrs. Norris,



<P>and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime



<P>intellectual state and dignity, the remaining six,



<P>under Miss Crawford's direction, were arranged round



<P>the other.&nbsp; It was a fine arrangement for Henry Crawford,



<P>who was close to Fanny, and with his hands full of business,



<P>having two persons' cards to manage as well as his own;



<P>for though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself



<P>mistress of the rules of the game in three minutes,



<P>he had yet to inspirit her play, sharpen her avarice,



<P>and harden her heart, which, especially in any competition



<P>with William, was a work of some difficulty; and as for



<P>Lady Bertram, he must continue in charge of all her fame



<P>and fortune through the whole evening; and if quick enough



<P>to keep her from looking at her cards when the deal began,



<P>must direct her in whatever was to be done with them



<P>to the end of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was in high spirits, doing everything with happy ease,



<P>and preeminent in all the lively turns, quick resources,



<P>and playful impudence that could do honour to the game;



<P>and the round table was altogether a very comfortable



<P>contrast to the steady sobriety and orderly silence of



<P>the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Twice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and



<P>success of his lady, but in vain; no pause was long enough



<P>for the time his measured manner needed; and very little



<P>of her state could be known till Mrs. Grant was able,



<P>at the end of the first rubber, to go to her and pay



<P>her compliments.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh dear, yes! very entertaining indeed.&nbsp; A very odd game.



<P>I do not know what it is all about.&nbsp; I am never to see



<P>my cards; and Mr. Crawford does all the rest."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bertram," said Crawford, some time afterwards, taking the



<P>opportunity of a little languor in the game, "I have never



<P>told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home."



<P>They had been hunting together, and were in the midst of a



<P>good run, and at some distance from Mansfield, when his horse



<P>being found to have flung a shoe, Henry Crawford had been



<P>obliged to give up, and make the best of his way back.



<P>"I told you I lost my way after passing that old farmhouse



<P>with the yew-trees, because I can never bear to ask;



<P>but I have not told you that, with my usual luck--for I



<P>never do wrong without gaining by it--I found myself in due



<P>time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see.



<P>I was suddenly, upon turning the corner of a steepish



<P>downy field, in the midst of a retired little village



<P>between gently rising hills; a small stream before me to



<P>be forded, a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right--



<P>which church was strikingly large and handsome for



<P>the place, and not a gentleman or half a gentleman's house



<P>to be seen excepting one--to be presumed the Parsonage--



<P>within a stone's throw of the said knoll and church.



<P>I found myself, in short, in Thornton Lacey."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It sounds like it," said Edmund; "but which way did you



<P>turn after passing Sewell's farm?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions;



<P>though were I to answer all that you could put in the course



<P>of an hour, you would never be able to prove that it



<P>was _not_ Thornton Lacey--for such it certainly was."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You inquired, then?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I never inquire.&nbsp; But I _told_ a man mending a hedge



<P>that it was Thornton Lacey, and he agreed to it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have a good memory.&nbsp; I had forgotten having ever



<P>told you half so much of the place."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thornton Lacey was the name of his impending living,



<P>as Miss Crawford well knew; and her interest in a negotiation



<P>for William Price's knave increased.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," continued Edmund, "and how did you like what



<P>you saw?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very much indeed.&nbsp; You are a lucky fellow.&nbsp; There will be



<P>work for five summers at least before the place is liveable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no, not so bad as that.&nbsp; The farmyard must be moved,



<P>I grant you; but I am not aware of anything else.



<P>The house is by no means bad, and when the yard is removed,



<P>there may be a very tolerable approach to it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The farmyard must be cleared away entirely, and planted



<P>up to shut out the blacksmith's shop.&nbsp; The house must



<P>be turned to front the east instead of the north--



<P>the entrance and principal rooms, I mean, must be on



<P>that side, where the view is really very pretty; I am



<P>sure it may be done.&nbsp; And _there_ must be your approach,



<P>through what is at present the garden.&nbsp; You must make



<P>a new garden at what is now the back of the house;



<P>which will be giving it the best aspect in the world,



<P>sloping to the south-east. The ground seems precisely



<P>formed for it.&nbsp; I rode fifty yards up the lane,



<P>between the church and the house, in order to look about me;



<P>and saw how it might all be.&nbsp; Nothing can be easier.



<P>The meadows beyond what _will_ _be_ the garden, as well



<P>as what now _is_, sweeping round from the lane I stood



<P>in to the north-east, that is, to the principal road



<P>through the village, must be all laid together, of course;



<P>very pretty meadows they are, finely sprinkled with timber.



<P>They belong to the living, I suppose; if not, you must



<P>purchase them.&nbsp; Then the stream--something must be done



<P>with the stream; but I could not quite determine what.



<P>I had two or three ideas."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I have two or three ideas also," said Edmund,



<P>"and one of them is, that very little of your plan



<P>for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in practice.



<P>I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty.



<P>I think the house and premises may be made comfortable,



<P>and given the air of a gentleman's residence, without any



<P>very heavy expense, and that must suffice me; and, I hope,



<P>may suffice all who care about me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford, a little suspicious and resentful of a



<P>certain tone of voice, and a certain half-look attending



<P>the last expression of his hope, made a hasty finish



<P>of her dealings with William Price; and securing his knave



<P>at an exorbitant rate, exclaimed, "There, I will stake



<P>my last like a woman of spirit.&nbsp; No cold prudence for me.



<P>I am not born to sit still and do nothing.&nbsp; If I lose



<P>the game, it shall not be from not striving for it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The game was hers, and only did not pay her for what



<P>she had given to secure it.&nbsp; Another deal proceeded,



<P>and Crawford began again about Thornton Lacey.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My plan may not be the best possible:&nbsp; I had not many



<P>minutes to form it in; but you must do a good deal.



<P>The place deserves it, and you will find yourself not



<P>satisfied with much less than it is capable of.&nbsp; (Excuse me,



<P>your ladyship must not see your cards.&nbsp; There, let them



<P>lie just before you.) The place deserves it, Bertram.



<P>You talk of giving it the air of a gentleman's residence.



<P>_That_ will be done by the removal of the farmyard;



<P>for, independent of that terrible nuisance, I never saw



<P>a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air



<P>of a gentleman's residence, so much the look of a something



<P>above a mere parsonage-house--above the expenditure of a few



<P>hundreds a year.&nbsp; It is not a scrambling collection of low



<P>single rooms, with as many roofs as windows; it is not



<P>cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse:



<P>it is a solid, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as one



<P>might suppose a respectable old country family had lived



<P>in from generation to generation, through two centuries



<P>at least, and were now spending from two to three thousand



<P>a year in."&nbsp; Miss Crawford listened, and Edmund agreed



<P>to this.&nbsp; "The air of a gentleman's residence, therefore,



<P>you cannot but give it, if you do anything.&nbsp; But it is



<P>capable of much more.&nbsp; (Let me see, Mary; Lady Bertram



<P>bids a dozen for that queen; no, no, a dozen is more



<P>than it is worth.&nbsp; Lady Bertram does not bid a dozen.



<P>She will have nothing to say to it.&nbsp; Go on, go on.)



<P>By some such improvements as I have suggested (I do not really



<P>require you to proceed upon my plan, though, by the bye,



<P>I doubt anybody's striking out a better) you may give it



<P>a higher character.&nbsp; You may raise it into a _place_.



<P>From being the mere gentleman's residence, it becomes,



<P>by judicious improvement, the residence of a man



<P>of education, taste, modern manners, good connexions.



<P>All this may be stamped on it; and that house receive



<P>such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great



<P>landholder of the parish by every creature travelling



<P>the road; especially as there is no real squire's house



<P>to dispute the point--a circumstance, between ourselves,



<P>to enhance the value of such a situation in point



<P>of privilege and independence beyond all calculation.



<P>_You_ think with me, I hope" (turning with a softened



<P>voice to Fanny). "Have you ever seen the place?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny gave a quick negative, and tried to hide her interest



<P>in the subject by an eager attention to her brother,



<P>who was driving as hard a bargain, and imposing on her



<P>as much as he could; but Crawford pursued with "No, no,



<P>you must not part with the queen.&nbsp; You have bought



<P>her too dearly, and your brother does not offer half



<P>her value.&nbsp; No, no, sir, hands off, hands off.&nbsp; Your sister



<P>does not part with the queen.&nbsp; She is quite determined.



<P>The game will be yours," turning to her again; "it will



<P>certainly be yours."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And Fanny had much rather it were William's," said Edmund,



<P>smiling at her.&nbsp; "Poor Fanny! not allowed to cheat herself



<P>as she wishes!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Bertram," said Miss Crawford, a few minutes afterwards,



<P>"you know Henry to be such a capital improver, that you



<P>cannot possibly engage in anything of the sort at Thornton



<P>Lacey without accepting his help.&nbsp; Only think how useful



<P>he was at Sotherton!&nbsp; Only think what grand things were



<P>produced there by our all going with him one hot day



<P>in August to drive about the grounds, and see his genius



<P>take fire.&nbsp; There we went, and there we came home again;



<P>and what was done there is not to be told!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's eyes were turned on Crawford for a moment



<P>with an expression more than grave--even reproachful;



<P>but on catching his, were instantly withdrawn.



<P>With something of consciousness he shook his head at



<P>his sister, and laughingly replied, "I cannot say there



<P>was much done at Sotherton; but it was a hot day, and we



<P>were all walking after each other, and bewildered."



<P>As soon as a general buzz gave him shelter, he added,



<P>in a low voice, directed solely at Fanny, "I should be



<P>sorry to have my powers of _planning_ judged of by the



<P>day at Sotherton.&nbsp; I see things very differently now.



<P>Do not think of me as I appeared then."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sotherton was a word to catch Mrs. Norris, and being



<P>just then in the happy leisure which followed securing



<P>the odd trick by Sir Thomas's capital play and her own



<P>against Dr. and Mrs. Grant's great hands, she called out,



<P>in high good-humour, "Sotherton!&nbsp; Yes, that is a place,



<P>indeed, and we had a charming day there.&nbsp; William, you are



<P>quite out of luck; but the next time you come, I hope dear



<P>Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth will be at home, and I am sure



<P>I can answer for your being kindly received by both.



<P>Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations,



<P>and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man.&nbsp; They are at



<P>Brighton now, you know; in one of the best houses there,



<P>as Mr. Rushworth's fine fortune gives them a right to be.



<P>I do not exactly know the distance, but when you get back



<P>to Portsmouth, if it is not very far off, you ought to go



<P>over and pay your respects to them; and I could send



<P>a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to



<P>your cousins."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should be very happy, aunt; but Brighton is almost



<P>by Beachey Head; and if I could get so far, I could



<P>not expect to be welcome in such a smart place as that--



<P>poor scrubby midshipman as I am."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the



<P>affability he might depend on, when she was stopped



<P>by Sir Thomas's saying with authority, "I do not advise



<P>your going to Brighton, William, as I trust you may soon



<P>have more convenient opportunities of meeting; but my



<P>daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere;



<P>and you will find Mr. Rushworth most sincerely disposed



<P>to regard all the connexions of our family as his own."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I would rather find him private secretary to the First



<P>Lord than anything else," was William's only answer,



<P>in an undervoice, not meant to reach far, and the



<P>subject dropped.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford's



<P>behaviour; but when the whist-table broke up at the end



<P>of the second rubber, and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris



<P>to dispute over their last play, he became a looker-on



<P>at the other, he found his niece the object of attentions,



<P>or rather of professions, of a somewhat pointed character.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Henry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme



<P>about Thornton Lacey; and not being able to catch



<P>Edmund's ear, was detailing it to his fair neighbour



<P>with a look of considerable earnestness.&nbsp; His scheme



<P>was to rent the house himself the following winter,



<P>that he might have a home of his own in that neighbourhood;



<P>and it was not merely for the use of it in the hunting-season



<P>(as he was then telling her), though _that_ consideration



<P>had certainly some weight, feeling as he did that,



<P>in spite of all Dr. Grant's very great kindness, it was



<P>impossible for him and his horses to be accommodated



<P>where they now were without material inconvenience;



<P>but his attachment to that neighbourhood did not depend



<P>upon one amusement or one season of the year:&nbsp; he had set



<P>his heart upon having a something there that he could



<P>come to at any time, a little homestall at his command,



<P>where all the holidays of his year might be spent, and he



<P>might find himself continuing, improving, and _perfecting_



<P>that friendship and intimacy with the Mansfield Park



<P>family which was increasing in value to him every day.



<P>Sir Thomas heard and was not offended.&nbsp; There was no want



<P>of respect in the young man's address; and Fanny's reception



<P>of it was so proper and modest, so calm and uninviting,



<P>that he had nothing to censure in her.&nbsp; She said little,



<P>assented only here and there, and betrayed no inclination



<P>either of appropriating any part of the compliment to herself,



<P>or of strengthening his views in favour of Northamptonshire.



<P>Finding by whom he was observed, Henry Crawford addressed



<P>himself on the same subject to Sir Thomas, in a more



<P>everyday tone, but still with feeling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I want to be your neighbour, Sir Thomas, as you have,



<P>perhaps, heard me telling Miss Price.&nbsp; May I hope



<P>for your acquiescence, and for your not influencing



<P>your son against such a tenant?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas, politely bowing, replied, "It is the only way,



<P>sir, in which I could _not_ wish you established as a



<P>permanent neighbour; but I hope, and believe, that Edmund will



<P>occupy his own house at Thornton Lacey.&nbsp; Edmund, am I saying too



<P>much?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund, on this appeal, had first to hear what was going on;



<P>but, on understanding the question, was at no loss for an answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly, sir, I have no idea but of residence.



<P>But, Crawford, though I refuse you as a tenant,



<P>come to me as a friend.&nbsp; Consider the house as half



<P>your own every winter, and we will add to the stables



<P>on your own improved plan, and with all the improvements



<P>of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We shall be the losers," continued Sir Thomas.



<P>"His going, though only eight miles, will be an unwelcome



<P>contraction of our family circle; but I should have been



<P>deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile



<P>himself to doing less.&nbsp; It is perfectly natural that you



<P>should not have thought much on the subject, Mr. Crawford.



<P>But a parish has wants and claims which can be known



<P>only by a clergyman constantly resident, and which no



<P>proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent.



<P>Edmund might, in the common phrase, do the duty of Thornton,



<P>that is, he might read prayers and preach, without giving



<P>up Mansfield Park:&nbsp; he might ride over every Sunday, to a



<P>house nominally inhabited, and go through divine service;



<P>he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day,



<P>for three or four hours, if that would content him.



<P>But it will not.&nbsp; He knows that human nature needs more



<P>lessons than a weekly sermon can convey; and that if he



<P>does not live among his parishioners, and prove himself,



<P>by constant attention, their well-wisher and friend, he does



<P>very little either for their good or his own."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Crawford bowed his acquiescence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I repeat again," added Sir Thomas, "that Thornton Lacey



<P>is the only house in the neighbourhood in which I should



<P>_not_ be happy to wait on Mr. Crawford as occupier."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Crawford bowed his thanks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sir Thomas," said Edmund, "undoubtedly understands



<P>the duty of a parish priest.&nbsp; We must hope his son



<P>may prove that _he_ knows it too."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Whatever effect Sir Thomas's little harangue might really



<P>produce on Mr. Crawford, it raised some awkward sensations



<P>in two of the others, two of his most attentive listeners--



<P>Miss Crawford and Fanny.&nbsp; One of whom, having never before



<P>understood that Thornton was so soon and so completely



<P>to be his home, was pondering with downcast eyes on what it



<P>would be _not_ to see Edmund every day; and the other,



<P>startled from the agreeable fancies she had been previously



<P>indulging on the strength of her brother's description,



<P>no longer able, in the picture she had been forming of a



<P>future Thornton, to shut out the church, sink the clergyman,



<P>and see only the respectable, elegant, modernised,



<P>and occasional residence of a man of independent fortune,



<P>was considering Sir Thomas, with decided ill-will,



<P>as the destroyer of all this, and suffering the more



<P>from that involuntary forbearance which his character



<P>and manner commanded, and from not daring to relieve



<P>herself by a single attempt at throwing ridicule on his cause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All the agreeable of _her_ speculation was over for that hour.



<P>It was time to have done with cards, if sermons prevailed;



<P>and she was glad to find it necessary to come to a conclusion,



<P>and be able to refresh her spirits by a change of place



<P>and neighbour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The chief of the party were now collected irregularly



<P>round the fire, and waiting the final break-up. William



<P>and Fanny were the most detached.&nbsp; They remained



<P>together at the otherwise deserted card-table, talking



<P>very comfortably, and not thinking of the rest, till some



<P>of the rest began to think of them.&nbsp; Henry Crawford's



<P>chair was the first to be given a direction towards them,



<P>and he sat silently observing them for a few minutes;



<P>himself, in the meanwhile, observed by Sir Thomas,



<P>who was standing in chat with Dr. Grant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is the assembly night," said William.&nbsp; "If I were



<P>at Portsmouth I should be at it, perhaps."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth, William?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, Fanny, that I do not.&nbsp; I shall have enough of Portsmouth



<P>and of dancing too, when I cannot have you.&nbsp; And I do not



<P>know that there would be any good in going to the assembly,



<P>for I might not get a partner.&nbsp; The Portsmouth girls turn



<P>up their noses at anybody who has not a commission.



<P>One might as well be nothing as a midshipman.



<P>One _is_ nothing, indeed.&nbsp; You remember the Gregorys;



<P>they are grown up amazing fine girls, but they will hardly



<P>speak to _me_, because Lucy is courted by a lieutenant."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! shame, shame!&nbsp; But never mind it, William" (her own



<P>cheeks in a glow of indignation as she spoke). "It is not



<P>worth minding.&nbsp; It is no reflection on _you_; it is no



<P>more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced,



<P>more or less, in their time.&nbsp; You must think of that,



<P>you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the



<P>hardships which fall to every sailor's share, like bad



<P>weather and hard living, only with this advantage,



<P>that there will be an end to it, that there will come



<P>a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure.



<P>When you are a lieutenant! only think, William, when you



<P>are a lieutenant, how little you will care for any nonsense



<P>of this kind."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant, Fanny.



<P>Everybody gets made but me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! my dear William, do not talk so; do not be so desponding.



<P>My uncle says nothing, but I am sure he will do everything



<P>in his power to get you made.&nbsp; He knows, as well as you do,



<P>of what consequence it is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was checked by the sight of her uncle much nearer



<P>to them than she had any suspicion of, and each found



<P>it necessary to talk of something else.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you fond of dancing, Fanny?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, very; only I am soon tired."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should like to go to a ball with you and see



<P>you dance.&nbsp; Have you never any balls at Northampton?



<P>I should like to see you dance, and I'd dance with you



<P>if you _would_, for nobody would know who I was here,



<P>and I should like to be your partner once more.



<P>We used to jump about together many a time, did not we?



<P>when the hand-organ was in the street?&nbsp; I am a pretty



<P>good dancer in my way, but I dare say you are a better."



<P>And turning to his uncle, who was now close to them,



<P>"Is not Fanny a very good dancer, sir?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, in dismay at such an unprecedented question,



<P>did not know which way to look, or how to be prepared



<P>for the answer.&nbsp; Some very grave reproof, or at least



<P>the coldest expression of indifference, must be coming



<P>to distress her brother, and sink her to the ground.



<P>But, on the contrary, it was no worse than, "I am sorry



<P>to say that I am unable to answer your question.



<P>I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a little girl;



<P>but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like



<P>a gentlewoman when we do see her, which, perhaps, we may



<P>have an opportunity of doing ere long."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance,



<P>Mr. Price," said Henry Crawford, leaning forward,



<P>"and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can



<P>make on the subject, to your entire satisfaction.



<P>But I believe" (seeing Fanny looked distressed) "it must



<P>be at some other time.&nbsp; There is _one_ person in company



<P>who does not like to have Miss Price spoken of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>True enough, he had once seen Fanny dance; and it was



<P>equally true that he would now have answered for her gliding



<P>about with quiet, light elegance, and in admirable time;



<P>but, in fact, he could not for the life of him recall



<P>what her dancing had been, and rather took it for granted



<P>that she had been present than remembered anything about her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He passed, however, for an admirer of her dancing;



<P>and Sir Thomas, by no means displeased, prolonged the



<P>conversation on dancing in general, and was so well



<P>engaged in describing the balls of Antigua, and listening



<P>to what his nephew could relate of the different modes



<P>of dancing which had fallen within his observation,



<P>that he had not heard his carriage announced, and was first



<P>called to the knowledge of it by the bustle of Mrs. Norris.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come, Fanny, Fanny, what are you about?&nbsp; We are going.



<P>Do not you see your aunt is going?&nbsp; Quick, quick!&nbsp; I cannot



<P>bear to keep good old Wilcox waiting.&nbsp; You should always



<P>remember the coachman and horses.&nbsp; My dear Sir Thomas,



<P>we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you,



<P>and Edmund and William."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas could not dissent, as it had been his



<P>own arrangement, previously communicated to his wife



<P>and sister; but _that_ seemed forgotten by Mrs. Norris,



<P>who must fancy that she settled it all herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's last feeling in the visit was disappointment:



<P>for the shawl which Edmund was quietly taking from the



<P>servant to bring and put round her shoulders was seized



<P>by Mr. Crawford's quicker hand, and she was obliged to be



<P>indebted to his more prominent attention.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Henry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning,



<P>and at an earlier hour than common visiting warrants.



<P>The two ladies were together in the breakfast-room, and,



<P>fortunately for him, Lady Bertram was on the very point



<P>of quitting it as he entered.&nbsp; She was almost at the door,



<P>and not chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain,



<P>she still went on, after a civil reception, a short sentence



<P>about being waited for, and a "Let Sir Thomas know"



<P>to the servant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Henry, overjoyed to have her go, bowed and watched her off,



<P>and without losing another moment, turned instantly to Fanny,



<P>and, taking out some letters, said, with a most animated look,



<P>"I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature



<P>who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone:



<P>I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea.



<P>Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are, I could



<P>hardly have borne that any one in the house should share



<P>with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring.



<P>He is made.&nbsp; Your brother is a lieutenant.&nbsp; I have



<P>the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your



<P>brother's promotion.&nbsp; Here are the letters which announce it,



<P>this moment come to hand.&nbsp; You will, perhaps, like to see them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny could not speak, but he did not want her to speak.



<P>To see the expression of her eyes, the change



<P>of her complexion, the progress of her feelings,



<P>their doubt, confusion, and felicity, was enough.



<P>She took the letters as he gave them.&nbsp; The first was



<P>from the Admiral to inform his nephew, in a few words,



<P>of his having succeeded in the object he had undertaken,



<P>the promotion of young Price, and enclosing two more,



<P>one from the Secretary of the First Lord to a friend,



<P>whom the Admiral had set to work in the business,



<P>the other from that friend to himself, by which it



<P>appeared that his lordship had the very great happiness



<P>of attending to the recommendation of Sir Charles;



<P>that Sir Charles was much delighted in having such an



<P>opportunity of proving his regard for Admiral Crawford,



<P>and that the circumstance of Mr. William Price's commission



<P>as Second Lieutenant of H.M. Sloop Thrush being made



<P>out was spreading general joy through a wide circle



<P>of great people.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While her hand was trembling under these letters,



<P>her eye running from one to the other, and her heart



<P>swelling with emotion, Crawford thus continued,



<P>with unfeigned eagerness, to express his interest in the event--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will not talk of my own happiness," said he, "great as



<P>it is, for I think only of yours.&nbsp; Compared with you,



<P>who has a right to be happy?&nbsp; I have almost grudged myself



<P>my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known



<P>before all the world.&nbsp; I have not lost a moment, however.



<P>The post was late this morning, but there has not been



<P>since a moment's delay.&nbsp; How impatient, how anxious,



<P>how wild I have been on the subject, I will not attempt



<P>to describe; how severely mortified, how cruelly disappointed,



<P>in not having it finished while I was in London!



<P>I was kept there from day to day in the hope of it,



<P>for nothing less dear to me than such an object would



<P>have detained me half the time from Mansfield.



<P>But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the



<P>warmth I could desire, and exerted himself immediately,



<P>there were difficulties from the absence of one friend,



<P>and the engagements of another, which at last I could no longer



<P>bear to stay the end of, and knowing in what good hands I



<P>left the cause, I came away on Monday, trusting that many



<P>posts would not pass before I should be followed by such



<P>very letters as these.&nbsp; My uncle, who is the very best man



<P>in the world, has exerted himself, as I knew he would,



<P>after seeing your brother.&nbsp; He was delighted with him.



<P>I would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted,



<P>or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his praise.



<P>I deferred it all till his praise should be proved



<P>the praise of a friend, as this day _does_ prove it.



<P>_Now_ I may say that even I could not require William



<P>Price to excite a greater interest, or be followed



<P>by warmer wishes and higher commendation, than were most



<P>voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had



<P>passed together."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Has this been all _your_ doing, then?" cried Fanny.



<P>"Good heaven! how very, very kind!&nbsp; Have you really--



<P>was it by _your_ desire?&nbsp; I beg your pardon, but I



<P>am bewildered.&nbsp; Did Admiral Crawford apply?&nbsp; How was it?



<P>I am stupefied."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Henry was most happy to make it more intelligible,



<P>by beginning at an earlier stage, and explaining very



<P>particularly what he had done.&nbsp; His last journey to London



<P>had been undertaken with no other view than that of



<P>introducing her brother in Hill Street, and prevailing



<P>on the Admiral to exert whatever interest he might



<P>have for getting him on.&nbsp; This had been his business.



<P>He had communicated it to no creature:&nbsp; he had not



<P>breathed a syllable of it even to Mary; while uncertain



<P>of the issue, he could not have borne any participation



<P>of his feelings, but this had been his business; and he



<P>spoke with such a glow of what his solicitude had been,



<P>and used such strong expressions, was so abounding



<P>in the _deepest_ _interest_, in _twofold_ _motives_,



<P>in _views_ _and_ _wishes_ _more_ _than_ _could_ _be_ _told_,



<P>that Fanny could not have remained insensible of his drift,



<P>had she been able to attend; but her heart was so full



<P>and her senses still so astonished, that she could listen



<P>but imperfectly even to what he told her of William,



<P>and saying only when he paused, "How kind! how very kind!



<P>Oh, Mr. Crawford, we are infinitely obliged to you!



<P>Dearest, dearest William!"&nbsp; She jumped up and moved in haste



<P>towards the door, crying out, "I will go to my uncle.



<P>My uncle ought to know it as soon as possible."&nbsp; But this



<P>could not be suffered.&nbsp; The opportunity was too fair,



<P>and his feelings too impatient.&nbsp; He was after her immediately.



<P>"She must not go, she must allow him five minutes longer,"



<P>and he took her hand and led her back to her seat,



<P>and was in the middle of his farther explanation,



<P>before she had suspected for what she was detained.



<P>When she did understand it, however, and found herself



<P>expected to believe that she had created sensations which



<P>his heart had never known before, and that everything



<P>he had done for William was to be placed to the account



<P>of his excessive and unequalled attachment to her,



<P>she was exceedingly distressed, and for some moments



<P>unable to speak.&nbsp; She considered it all as nonsense,



<P>as mere trifling and gallantry, which meant only to deceive



<P>for the hour; she could not but feel that it was treating



<P>her improperly and unworthily, and in such a way as she



<P>had not deserved; but it was like himself, and entirely



<P>of a piece with what she had seen before; and she would



<P>not allow herself to shew half the displeasure she felt,



<P>because he had been conferring an obligation, which no



<P>want of delicacy on his part could make a trifle to her.



<P>While her heart was still bounding with joy and gratitude



<P>on William's behalf, she could not be severely resentful



<P>of anything that injured only herself; and after having



<P>twice drawn back her hand, and twice attempted in vain



<P>to turn away from him, she got up, and said only,



<P>with much agitation, "Don't, Mr. Crawford, pray don't! I



<P>beg you would not.&nbsp; This is a sort of talking which is very



<P>unpleasant to me.&nbsp; I must go away.&nbsp; I cannot bear it."



<P>But he was still talking on, describing his affection,



<P>soliciting a return, and, finally, in words so plain



<P>as to bear but one meaning even to her, offering himself,



<P>hand, fortune, everything, to her acceptance.&nbsp; It was so;



<P>he had said it.&nbsp; Her astonishment and confusion increased;



<P>and though still not knowing how to suppose him serious,



<P>she could hardly stand.&nbsp; He pressed for an answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no, no!" she cried, hiding her face.&nbsp; "This is all nonsense.



<P>Do not distress me.&nbsp; I can hear no more of this.



<P>Your kindness to William makes me more obliged to you



<P>than words can express; but I do not want, I cannot bear,



<P>I must not listen to such--No, no, don't think of me.



<P>But you are _not_ thinking of me.&nbsp; I know it is all nothing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had burst away from him, and at that moment Sir Thomas



<P>was heard speaking to a servant in his way towards the room



<P>they were in.&nbsp; It was no time for farther assurances



<P>or entreaty, though to part with her at a moment when her



<P>modesty alone seemed, to his sanguine and preassured mind,



<P>to stand in the way of the happiness he sought, was a



<P>cruel necessity.&nbsp; She rushed out at an opposite door



<P>from the one her uncle was approaching, and was walking



<P>up and down the East room ill the utmost confusion



<P>of contrary feeling, before Sir Thomas's politeness



<P>or apologies were over, or he had reached the beginning



<P>of the joyful intelligence which his visitor came to communicate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was feeling, thinking, trembling about everything;



<P>agitated, happy, miserable, infinitely obliged,



<P>absolutely angry.&nbsp; It was all beyond belief!



<P>He was inexcusable, incomprehensible!&nbsp; But such were



<P>his habits that he could do nothing without a mixture



<P>of evil.&nbsp; He had previously made her the happiest



<P>of human beings, and now he had insulted--she knew



<P>not what to say, how to class, or how to regard it.



<P>She would not have him be serious, and yet what could



<P>excuse the use of such words and offers, if they meant but to



<P>trifle?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But William was a lieutenant.&nbsp; _That_ was a fact beyond



<P>a doubt, and without an alloy.&nbsp; She would think of it



<P>for ever and forget all the rest.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford would



<P>certainly never address her so again:&nbsp; he must have



<P>seen how unwelcome it was to her; and in that case,



<P>how gratefully she could esteem him for his friendship



<P>to William!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She would not stir farther from the East room than



<P>the head of the great staircase, till she had satisfied



<P>herself of Mr. Crawford's having left the house;



<P>but when convinced of his being gone, she was eager to go



<P>down and be with her uncle, and have all the happiness



<P>of his joy as well as her own, and all the benefit



<P>of his information or his conjectures as to what would



<P>now be William's destination.&nbsp; Sir Thomas was as joyful



<P>as she could desire, and very kind and communicative;



<P>and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William



<P>as to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her,



<P>till she found, towards the close, that Mr. Crawford



<P>was engaged to return and dine there that very day.



<P>This was a most unwelcome hearing, for though he might



<P>think nothing of what had passed, it would be quite



<P>distressing to her to see him again so soon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She tried to get the better of it; tried very hard,



<P>as the dinner hour approached, to feel and appear as usual;



<P>but it was quite impossible for her not to look most shy



<P>and uncomfortable when their visitor entered the room.



<P>She could not have supposed it in the power of any concurrence



<P>of circumstances to give her so many painful sensations on



<P>the first day of hearing of William's promotion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Crawford was not only in the room--he was soon close



<P>to her.&nbsp; He had a note to deliver from his sister.



<P>Fanny could not look at him, but there was no consciousness



<P>of past folly in his voice.&nbsp; She opened her note immediately,



<P>glad to have anything to do, and happy, as she read it,



<P>to feel that the fidgetings of her aunt Norris, who was



<P>also to dine there, screened her a little from view.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Fanny,--for so I may now always call you,



<P>to the infinite relief of a tongue that has been stumbling



<P>at _Miss_ _Price_ for at least the last six weeks--



<P>I cannot let my brother go without sending you a few lines



<P>of general congratulation, and giving my most joyful consent



<P>and approval.&nbsp; Go on, my dear Fanny, and without fear;



<P>there can be no difficulties worth naming.&nbsp; I chuse to



<P>suppose that the assurance of my consent will be something;



<P>so you may smile upon him with your sweetest smiles



<P>this afternoon, and send him back to me even happier



<P>than he goes.--Yours affectionately, M. C."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These were not expressions to do Fanny any good;



<P>for though she read in too much haste and confusion



<P>to form the clearest judgment of Miss Crawford's meaning,



<P>it was evident that she meant to compliment her on her



<P>brother's attachment, and even to _appear_ to believe



<P>it serious.&nbsp; She did not know what to do, or what to think.



<P>There was wretchedness in the idea of its being serious;



<P>there was perplexity and agitation every way.



<P>She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her,



<P>and he spoke to her much too often; and she was afraid



<P>there was a something in his voice and manner in addressing



<P>her very different from what they were when he talked



<P>to the others.&nbsp; Her comfort in that day's dinner



<P>was quite destroyed:&nbsp; she could hardly eat anything;



<P>and when Sir Thomas good-humouredly observed that joy had



<P>taken away her appetite, she was ready to sink with shame,



<P>from the dread of Mr. Crawford's interpretation;



<P>for though nothing could have tempted her to turn her eyes



<P>to the right hand, where he sat, she felt that _his_



<P>were immediately directed towards her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was more silent than ever.&nbsp; She would hardly join



<P>even when William was the subject, for his commission



<P>came all from the right hand too, and there was pain



<P>in the connexion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever, and began



<P>to be in despair of ever getting away; but at last they



<P>were in the drawing-room, and she was able to think



<P>as she would, while her aunts finished the subject



<P>of William's appointment in their own style.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris seemed as much delighted with the saving



<P>it would be to Sir Thomas as with any part of it.



<P>"_Now_ William would be able to keep himself, which would



<P>make a vast difference to his uncle, for it was unknown



<P>how much he had cost his uncle; and, indeed, it would make



<P>some difference in _her_ presents too.&nbsp; She was very glad



<P>that she had given William what she did at parting,



<P>very glad, indeed, that it had been in her power,



<P>without material inconvenience, just at that time to give



<P>him something rather considerable; that is, for_her_,



<P>with _her_ limited means, for now it would all be useful



<P>in helping to fit up his cabin.&nbsp; She knew he must be at



<P>some expense, that he would have many things to buy,



<P>though to be sure his father and mother would be able



<P>to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap;



<P>but she was very glad she had contributed her mite



<P>towards it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am glad you gave him something considerable,"



<P>said Lady Bertram, with most unsuspicious calmness,



<P>"for _I_ gave him only 10."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed!" cried Mrs. Norris, reddening.&nbsp; "Upon my word,



<P>he must have gone off with his pockets 1 well lined,



<P>and at no expense for his journey to London either!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sir Thomas told me 10 would be enough."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris, being not at all inclined to question



<P>its sufficiency, began to take the matter in another point.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is amazing," said she, "how much young people cost



<P>their friends, what with bringing them up and putting them



<P>out in the world!&nbsp; They little think how much it comes to,



<P>or what their parents, or their uncles and aunts, pay for



<P>them in the course of the year.&nbsp; Now, here are my sister



<P>Price's children; take them all together, I dare say nobody



<P>would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year,



<P>to say nothing of what _I_ do for them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very true, sister, as you say.&nbsp; But, poor things!



<P>they cannot help it; and you know it makes very little



<P>difference to Sir Thomas.&nbsp; Fanny, William must not forget



<P>my shawl if he goes to the East Indies; and I shall give



<P>him a commission for anything else that is worth having.



<P>I wish he may go to the East Indies, that I may have my shawl.



<P>I think I will have two shawls, Fanny."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, meanwhile, speaking only when she could not help it,



<P>was very earnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss



<P>Crawford were at.&nbsp; There was everything in the world



<P>_against_ their being serious but his words and manner.



<P>Everything natural, probable, reasonable, was against it;



<P>all their habits and ways of thinking, and all



<P>her own demerits.&nbsp; How could _she_ have excited



<P>serious attachment in a man who had seen so many,



<P>and been admired by so many, and flirted with so many,



<P>infinitely her superiors; who seemed so little open



<P>to serious impressions, even where pains had been taken



<P>to please him; who thought so slightly, so carelessly,



<P>so unfeelingly on all such points; who was everything



<P>to everybody, and seemed to find no one essential to him?



<P>And farther, how could it be supposed that his sister,



<P>with all her high and worldly notions of matrimony,



<P>would be forwarding anything of a serious nature in such



<P>a quarter?&nbsp; Nothing could be more unnatural in either.



<P>Fanny was ashamed of her own doubts.&nbsp; Everything might



<P>be possible rather than serious attachment, or serious



<P>approbation of it toward her.&nbsp; She had quite convinced herself



<P>of this before Sir Thomas and Mr. Crawford joined them.



<P>The difficulty was in maintaining the conviction quite



<P>so absolutely after Mr. Crawford was in the room;



<P>for once or twice a look seemed forced on her which she



<P>did not know how to class among the common meaning;



<P>in any other man, at least, she would have said



<P>that it meant something very earnest, very pointed.



<P>But she still tried to believe it no more than what he



<P>might often have expressed towards her cousins and fifty



<P>other women.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She thought he was wishing to speak to her unheard



<P>by the rest.&nbsp; She fancied he was trying for it the



<P>whole evening at intervals, whenever Sir Thomas was



<P>out of the room, or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris,



<P>and she carefully refused him every opportunity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last--it seemed an at last to Fanny's nervousness,



<P>though not remarkably late--he began to talk of going away;



<P>but the comfort of the sound was impaired by his turning



<P>to her the next moment, and saying, "Have you nothing to send



<P>to Mary?&nbsp; No answer to her note?&nbsp; She will be disappointed



<P>if she receives nothing from you.&nbsp; Pray write to her,



<P>if it be only a line."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh yes! certainly," cried Fanny, rising in haste,



<P>the haste of embarrassment and of wanting to get away--



<P>"I will write directly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She went accordingly to the table, where she was in the



<P>habit of writing for her aunt, and prepared her materials



<P>without knowing what in the world to say.&nbsp; She had read



<P>Miss Crawford's note only once, and how to reply to



<P>anything so imperfectly understood was most distressing.



<P>Quite unpractised in such sort of note-writing, had



<P>there been time for scruples and fears as to style she



<P>would have felt them in abundance:&nbsp; but something must



<P>be instantly written; and with only one decided feeling,



<P>that of wishing not to appear to think anything really intended,



<P>she wrote thus, in great trembling both of spirits and hand--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am very much obliged to you, my dear Miss Crawford,



<P>for your kind congratulations, as far as they relate to my



<P>dearest William.&nbsp; The rest of your note I know means nothing;



<P>but I am so unequal to anything of the sort, that I hope



<P>you will excuse my begging you to take no farther notice.



<P>I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand



<P>his manners; if he understood me as well, he would,



<P>I dare say, behave differently.&nbsp; I do not know what I write,



<P>but it would be a great favour of you never to mention



<P>the subject again.&nbsp; With thanks for the honour of your note,



<P>I remain, dear Miss Crawford, etc., etc."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing



<P>fright, for she found that Mr. Crawford, under pretence



<P>of receiving the note, was coming towards her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You cannot think I mean to hurry you," said he,



<P>in an undervoice, perceiving the amazing trepidation



<P>with which she made up the note, "you cannot think



<P>I have any such object.&nbsp; Do not hurry yourself, I entreat."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!&nbsp; I thank you; I have quite done, just done; it will



<P>be ready in a moment; I am very much obliged to you;



<P>if you will be so good as to give _that_ to Miss Crawford."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The note was held out, and must be taken; and as she



<P>instantly and with averted eyes walked towards the fireplace,



<P>where sat the others, he had nothing to do but to go



<P>in good earnest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny thought she had never known a day of greater agitation,



<P>both of pain and pleasure; but happily the pleasure



<P>was not of a sort to die with the day; for every day



<P>would restore the knowledge of William's advancement,



<P>whereas the pain, she hoped, would return no more.



<P>She had no doubt that her note must appear excessively



<P>ill-written, that the language would disgrace a child,



<P>for her distress had allowed no arrangement; but at least



<P>it would assure them both of her being neither imposed



<P>on nor gratified by Mr. Crawford's attentions.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Miss Crawford's uneasiness was much lightened by



<P>this conversation, and she walked home again in spirits



<P>which might have defied almost another week of the same



<P>small party in the same bad weather, had they been put



<P>to the proof; but as that very evening brought her brother



<P>down from London again in quite, or more than quite,



<P>his usual cheerfulness, she had nothing farther to try



<P>her own.&nbsp; His still refusing to tell her what he had gone



<P>for was but the promotion of gaiety; a day before it



<P>might have irritated, but now it was a pleasant joke--



<P>suspected only of concealing something planned as a pleasant



<P>surprise to herself.&nbsp; And the next day _did_ bring a



<P>surprise to her.&nbsp; Henry had said he should just go and ask



<P>the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes,



<P>but he was gone above an hour; and when his sister,



<P>who had been waiting for him to walk with her in the garden,



<P>met him at last most impatiently in the sweep, and cried out,



<P>"My dear Henry, where can you have been all this time?"



<P>he had only to say that he had been sitting with Lady



<P>Bertram and Fanny.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sitting with them an hour and a half!" exclaimed Mary.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But this was only the beginning of her surprise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Mary," said he, drawing her arm within his,



<P>and walking along the sweep as if not knowing where he was:



<P>"I could not get away sooner; Fanny looked so lovely!



<P>I am quite determined, Mary.&nbsp; My mind is entirely made up.



<P>Will it astonish you?&nbsp; No: you must be aware that I am quite



<P>determined to marry Fanny Price."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The surprise was now complete; for, in spite of whatever



<P>his consciousness might suggest, a suspicion of his having



<P>any such views had never entered his sister's imagination;



<P>and she looked so truly the astonishment she felt, that he



<P>was obliged to repeat what he had said, and more fully



<P>and more solemnly.&nbsp; The conviction of his determination



<P>once admitted, it was not unwelcome.&nbsp; There was even



<P>pleasure with the surprise.&nbsp; Mary was in a state of mind



<P>to rejoice in a connexion with the Bertram family,



<P>and to be not displeased with her brother's marrying



<P>a little beneath him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Mary," was Henry's concluding assurance.&nbsp; "I am



<P>fairly caught.&nbsp; You know with what idle designs I began;



<P>but this is the end of them.&nbsp; I have, I flatter myself,



<P>made no inconsiderable progress in her affections;



<P>but my own are entirely fixed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Lucky, lucky girl!" cried Mary, as soon as she could speak;



<P>"what a match for her!&nbsp; My dearest Henry, this must



<P>be my _first_ feeling; but my _second_, which you shall



<P>have as sincerely, is, that I approve your choice from



<P>my soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I



<P>wish and desire it.&nbsp; You will have a sweet little wife;



<P>all gratitude and devotion.&nbsp; Exactly what you deserve.



<P>What an amazing match for her!&nbsp; Mrs. Norris often talks



<P>of her luck; what will she say now?&nbsp; The delight of all



<P>the family, indeed!&nbsp; And she has some _true_ friends in it!



<P>How _they_ will rejoice!&nbsp; But tell me all about it!



<P>Talk to me for ever.&nbsp; When did you begin to think seriously



<P>about her?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nothing could be more impossible than to answer such



<P>a question, though nothing could be more agreeable than



<P>to have it asked.&nbsp; "How the pleasing plague had stolen



<P>on him" he could not say; and before he had expressed



<P>the same sentiment with a little variation of words



<P>three times over, his sister eagerly interrupted him with,



<P>"Ah, my dear Henry, and this is what took you to London!



<P>This was your business!&nbsp; You chose to consult the Admiral



<P>before you made up your mind."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But this he stoutly denied.&nbsp; He knew his uncle too well



<P>to consult him on any matrimonial scheme.&nbsp; The Admiral



<P>hated marriage, and thought it never pardonable in a young



<P>man of independent fortune.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When Fanny is known to him," continued Henry, "he will doat



<P>on her.&nbsp; She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice



<P>of such a man as the Admiral, for she he would describe,



<P>if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody



<P>his own ideas.&nbsp; But till it is absolutely settled--



<P>settled beyond all interference, he shall know nothing



<P>of the matter.&nbsp; No, Mary, you are quite mistaken.



<P>You have not discovered my business yet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, well, I am satisfied.&nbsp; I know now to whom



<P>it must relate, and am in no hurry for the rest.



<P>Fanny Price! wonderful, quite wonderful!&nbsp; That Mansfield



<P>should have done so much for--that _you_ should have



<P>found your fate in Mansfield!&nbsp; But you are quite right;



<P>you could not have chosen better.&nbsp; There is not a better



<P>girl in the world, and you do not want for fortune;



<P>and as to her connexions, they are more than good.



<P>The Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people



<P>in this country.&nbsp; She is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram;



<P>that will be enough for the world.&nbsp; But go on, go on.



<P>Tell me more.&nbsp; What are your plans?&nbsp; Does she know her



<P>own happiness?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What are you waiting for?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"For--for very little more than opportunity.&nbsp; Mary, she is



<P>not like her cousins; but I think I shall not ask in vain."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh no! you cannot.&nbsp; Were you even less pleasing--



<P>supposing her not to love you already (of which,



<P>however, I can have little doubt)--you would be safe.



<P>The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would



<P>secure her all your own immediately.&nbsp; From my soul I do



<P>not think she would marry you _without_ love; that is,



<P>if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced



<P>by ambition, I can suppose it her; but ask her to love you,



<P>and she will never have the heart to refuse."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As soon as her eagerness could rest in silence,



<P>he was as happy to tell as she could be to listen;



<P>and a conversation followed almost as deeply interesting



<P>to her as to himself, though he had in fact nothing



<P>to relate but his own sensations, nothing to dwell on



<P>but Fanny's charms.&nbsp; Fanny's beauty of face and figure,



<P>Fanny's graces of manner and goodness of heart, were the



<P>exhaustless theme.&nbsp; The gentleness, modesty, and sweetness



<P>of her character were warmly expatiated on; that sweetness



<P>which makes so essential a part of every woman's worth



<P>in the judgment of man, that though he sometimes loves



<P>where it is not, he can never believe it absent.



<P>Her temper he had good reason to depend on and to praise.



<P>He had often seen it tried.&nbsp; Was there one of the family,



<P>excepting Edmund, who had not in some way or other



<P>continually exercised her patience and forbearance?



<P>Her affections were evidently strong.&nbsp; To see her with



<P>her brother!&nbsp; What could more delightfully prove that



<P>the warmth of her heart was equal to its gentleness?



<P>What could be more encouraging to a man who had her love



<P>in view?&nbsp; Then, her understanding was beyond every suspicion,



<P>quick and clear; and her manners were the mirror of



<P>her own modest and elegant mind.&nbsp; Nor was this all.



<P>Henry Crawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of good



<P>principles in a wife, though he was too little accustomed



<P>to serious reflection to know them by their proper name;



<P>but when he talked of her having such a steadiness



<P>and regularity of conduct, such a high notion of honour,



<P>and such an observance of decorum as might warrant any man



<P>in the fullest dependence on her faith and integrity,



<P>he expressed what was inspired by the knowledge of her



<P>being well principled and religious.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her," said he;



<P>"and _that_ is what I want."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well might his sister, believing as she really did that his



<P>opinion of Fanny Price was scarcely beyond her merits,



<P>rejoice in her prospects.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The more I think of it," she cried, "the more am I convinced



<P>that you are doing quite right; and though I should never have



<P>selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you,



<P>I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy.



<P>Your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever



<P>thought indeed.&nbsp; You will both find your good in it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was bad, very bad in me against such a creature;



<P>but I did not know her then; and she shall have no reason



<P>to lament the hour that first put it into my head.



<P>I will make her very happy, Mary; happier than she has ever



<P>yet been herself, or ever seen anybody else.&nbsp; I will not



<P>take her from Northamptonshire.&nbsp; I shall let Everingham,



<P>and rent a place in this neighbourhood; perhaps Stanwix Lodge.



<P>I shall let a seven years' lease of Everingham.



<P>I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word.



<P>I could name three people now, who would give me my own



<P>terms and thank me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ha!" cried Mary; "settle in Northamptonshire!



<P>That is pleasant!&nbsp; Then we shall be all together."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When she had spoken it, she recollected herself,



<P>and wished it unsaid; but there was no need of confusion;



<P>for her brother saw her only as the supposed inmate



<P>of Mansfield parsonage, and replied but to invite her



<P>in the kindest manner to his own house, and to claim



<P>the best right in her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You must give us more than half your time," said he.



<P>"I cannot admit Mrs. Grant to have an equal claim with



<P>Fanny and myself, for we shall both have a right in you.



<P>Fanny will be so truly your sister!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mary had only to be grateful and give general assurances;



<P>but she was now very fully purposed to be the guest of



<P>neither brother nor sister many months longer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's right; and in London, of course, a house of



<P>your own:&nbsp; no longer with the Admiral.&nbsp; My dearest Henry,



<P>the advantage to you of getting away from the Admiral



<P>before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his,



<P>before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions,



<P>or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best



<P>blessing of life!&nbsp; _You_ are not sensible of the gain,



<P>for your regard for him has blinded you; but, in my estimation,



<P>your marrying early may be the saving of you.&nbsp; To have seen



<P>you grow like the Admiral in word or deed, look or gesture,



<P>would have broken my heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, well, we do not think quite alike here.



<P>The Admiral has his faults, but he is a very good man,



<P>and has been more than a father to me.&nbsp; Few fathers would



<P>have let me have my own way half so much.&nbsp; You must



<P>not prejudice Fanny against him.&nbsp; I must have them love



<P>one another."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mary refrained from saying what she felt, that there could



<P>not be two persons in existence whose characters and manners



<P>were less accordant:&nbsp; time would discover it to him;



<P>but she could not help _this_ reflection on the Admiral.



<P>"Henry, I think so highly of Fanny Price, that if I could



<P>suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason



<P>which my poor ill-used aunt had to abhor the very name,



<P>I would prevent the marriage, if possible; but I know you:



<P>I know that a wife you _loved_ would be the happiest



<P>of women, and that even when you ceased to love, she would



<P>yet find in you the liberality and good-breeding of



<P>a gentleman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The impossibility of not doing everything in the world to



<P>make Fanny Price happy, or of ceasing to love Fanny Price,



<P>was of course the groundwork of his eloquent answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Had you seen her this morning, Mary," he continued,



<P>"attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to



<P>all the demands of her aunt's stupidity, working with her,



<P>and for her, her colour beautifully heightened as she



<P>leant over the work, then returning to her seat to finish



<P>a note which she was previously engaged in writing



<P>for that stupid woman's service, and all this with such



<P>unpretending gentleness, so much as if it were a matter



<P>of course that she was not to have a moment at her



<P>own command, her hair arranged as neatly as it always is,



<P>and one little curl falling forward as she wrote, which she



<P>now and then shook back, and in the midst of all this,



<P>still speaking at intervals to _me_, or listening,



<P>and as if she liked to listen, to what I said.



<P>Had you seen her so, Mary, you would not have implied



<P>the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dearest Henry," cried Mary, stopping short, and smiling



<P>in his face, "how glad I am to see you so much in love!



<P>It quite delights me.&nbsp; But what will Mrs. Rushworth and



<P>Julia say?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I care neither what they say nor what they feel.



<P>They will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me,



<P>that can attach a man of sense.&nbsp; I wish the discovery



<P>may do them any good.&nbsp; And they will now see their cousin



<P>treated as she ought to be, and I wish they may be heartily



<P>ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness.



<P>They will be angry," he added, after a moment's silence,



<P>and in a cooler tone; "Mrs. Rushworth will be very angry.



<P>It will be a bitter pill to her; that is, like other



<P>bitter pills, it will have two moments' ill flavour, and then



<P>be swallowed and forgotten; for I am not such a coxcomb



<P>as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women's,



<P>though _I_ was the object of them.&nbsp; Yes, Mary, my Fanny



<P>will feel a difference indeed:&nbsp; a daily, hourly difference,



<P>in the behaviour of every being who approaches her;



<P>and it will be the completion of my happiness to know



<P>that I am the doer of it, that I am the person to give



<P>the consequence so justly her due.&nbsp; Now she is dependent,



<P>helpless, friendless, neglected, forgotten."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nay, Henry, not by all; not forgotten by all; not friendless



<P>or forgotten.&nbsp; Her cousin Edmund never forgets her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Edmund!&nbsp; True, I believe he is, generally speaking,



<P>kind to her, and so is Sir Thomas in his way; but it is



<P>the way of a rich, superior, long-worded, arbitrary uncle.



<P>What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together do, what do they



<P>_do_ for her happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity in



<P>the world, to what I _shall_ do?"

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Henry Crawford had quite made up his mind by the



<P>next morning to give another fortnight to Mansfield,



<P>and having sent for his hunters, and written a few



<P>lines of explanation to the Admiral, he looked round at



<P>his sister as he sealed and threw the letter from him,



<P>and seeing the coast clear of the rest of the family,



<P>said, with a smile, "And how do you think I mean to



<P>amuse myself, Mary, on the days that I do not hunt?



<P>I am grown too old to go out more than three times a week;



<P>but I have a plan for the intermediate days, and what do you think



<P>it is?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To walk and ride with me, to be sure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not exactly, though I shall be happy to do both, but _that_



<P>would be exercise only to my body, and I must take care



<P>of my mind.&nbsp; Besides, _that_ would be all recreation



<P>and indulgence, without the wholesome alloy of labour,



<P>and I do not like to eat the bread of idleness.&nbsp; No, my plan



<P>is to make Fanny Price in love with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Fanny Price!&nbsp; Nonsense!&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; You ought to be



<P>satisfied with her two cousins."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But I cannot be satisfied without Fanny Price,



<P>without making a small hole in Fanny Price's heart.



<P>You do not seem properly aware of her claims to notice.



<P>When we talked of her last night, you none of you



<P>seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has



<P>taken place in her looks within the last six weeks.



<P>You see her every day, and therefore do not notice it;



<P>but I assure you she is quite a different creature



<P>from what she was in the autumn.&nbsp; She was then merely



<P>a quiet, modest, not plain-looking girl, but she is now



<P>absolutely pretty.&nbsp; I used to think she had neither



<P>complexion nor countenance; but in that soft skin of hers,



<P>so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday,



<P>there is decided beauty; and from what I observed of her



<P>eyes and mouth, I do not despair of their being capable



<P>of expression enough when she has anything to express.



<P>And then, her air, her manner, her _tout_ _ensemble_,



<P>is so indescribably improved!&nbsp; She must be grown two inches,



<P>at least, since October."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Phoo! phoo!&nbsp; This is only because there were no tall women



<P>to compare her with, and because she has got a new gown,



<P>and you never saw her so well dressed before.&nbsp; She is



<P>just what she was in October, believe me.&nbsp; The truth is,



<P>that she was the only girl in company for you to notice,



<P>and you must have a somebody.&nbsp; I have always thought



<P>her pretty--not strikingly pretty--but 'pretty enough,'



<P>as people say; a sort of beauty that grows on one.



<P>Her eyes should be darker, but she has a sweet smile;



<P>but as for this wonderful degree of improvement, I am



<P>sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress,



<P>and your having nobody else to look at; and therefore,



<P>if you do set about a flirtation with her, you never



<P>will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty,



<P>or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness



<P>and folly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her brother gave only a smile to this accusation,



<P>and soon afterwards said, "I do not quite know what to make



<P>of Miss Fanny.&nbsp; I do not understand her.&nbsp; I could not tell



<P>what she would be at yesterday.&nbsp; What is her character?



<P>Is she solemn?&nbsp; Is she queer?&nbsp; Is she prudish?&nbsp; Why did



<P>she draw back and look so grave at me?&nbsp; I could hardly get



<P>her to speak.&nbsp; I never was so long in company with a girl



<P>in my life, trying to entertain her, and succeed so ill!



<P>Never met with a girl who looked so grave on me!



<P>I must try to get the better of this.&nbsp; Her looks say,



<P>'I will not like you, I am determined not to like you';



<P>and I say she shall."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Foolish fellow!&nbsp; And so this is her attraction after all!



<P>This it is, her not caring about you, which gives



<P>her such a soft skin, and makes her so much taller,



<P>and produces all these charms and graces!&nbsp; I do desire



<P>that you will not be making her really unhappy;



<P>a _little_ love, perhaps, may animate and do her good,



<P>but I will not have you plunge her deep, for she is as



<P>good a little creature as ever lived, and has a great



<P>deal of feeling."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It can be but for a fortnight," said Henry; "and if a



<P>fortnight can kill her, she must have a constitution



<P>which nothing could save.&nbsp; No, I will not do her any harm,



<P>dear little soul! only want her to look kindly on me,



<P>to give me smiles as well as blushes, to keep a chair



<P>for me by herself wherever we are, and be all animation



<P>when I take it and talk to her; to think as I think,



<P>be interested in all my possessions and pleasures,



<P>try to keep me longer at Mansfield, and feel when I



<P>go away that she shall be never happy again.&nbsp; I want



<P>nothing more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Moderation itself!" said Mary.&nbsp; "I can have no scruples now.



<P>Well, you will have opportunities enough of endeavouring



<P>to recommend yourself, for we are a great deal together."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And without attempting any farther remonstrance, she left



<P>Fanny to her fate, a fate which, had not Fanny's heart



<P>been guarded in a way unsuspected by Miss Crawford,



<P>might have been a little harder than she deserved;



<P>for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young



<P>ladies of eighteen (or one should not read about them)



<P>as are never to be persuaded into love against their judgment



<P>by all that talent, manner, attention, and flattery can do,



<P>I have no inclination to believe Fanny one of them,



<P>or to think that with so much tenderness of disposition,



<P>and so much taste as belonged to her, she could have



<P>escaped heart-whole from the courtship (though the



<P>courtship only of a fortnight) of such a man as Crawford,



<P>in spite of there being some previous ill opinion of him



<P>to be overcome, had not her affection been engaged elsewhere.



<P>With all the security which love of another and disesteem



<P>of him could give to the peace of mind he was attacking,



<P>his continued attentions--continued, but not obtrusive,



<P>and adapting themselves more and more to the gentleness



<P>and delicacy of her character--obliged her very soon



<P>to dislike him less than formerly.&nbsp; She had by no means



<P>forgotten the past, and she thought as ill of him as ever;



<P>but she felt his powers:&nbsp; he was entertaining; and his



<P>manners were so improved, so polite, so seriously and



<P>blamelessly polite, that it was impossible not to be civil



<P>to him in return.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A very few days were enough to effect this; and at the end



<P>of those few days, circumstances arose which had a tendency



<P>rather to forward his views of pleasing her, inasmuch as



<P>they gave her a degree of happiness which must dispose



<P>her to be pleased with everybody.&nbsp; William, her brother,



<P>the so long absent and dearly loved brother, was in



<P>England again.&nbsp; She had a letter from him herself, a few



<P>hurried happy lines, written as the ship came up Channel,



<P>and sent into Portsmouth with the first boat that left



<P>the Antwerp at anchor in Spithead; and when Crawford walked



<P>up with the newspaper in his hand, which he had hoped



<P>would bring the first tidings, he found her trembling



<P>with joy over this letter, and listening with a glowing,



<P>grateful countenance to the kind invitation which her



<P>uncle was most collectedly dictating in reply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was but the day before that Crawford had made himself



<P>thoroughly master of the subject, or had in fact become



<P>at all aware of her having such a brother, or his being



<P>in such a ship, but the interest then excited had been



<P>very properly lively, determining him on his return to



<P>town to apply for information as to the probable period



<P>of the Antwerp's return from the Mediterranean, etc.;



<P>and the good luck which attended his early examination



<P>of ship news the next morning seemed the reward of his



<P>ingenuity in finding out such a method of pleasing her,



<P>as well as of his dutiful attention to the Admiral,



<P>in having for many years taken in the paper esteemed



<P>to have the earliest naval intelligence.&nbsp; He proved,



<P>however, to be too late.&nbsp; All those fine first feelings,



<P>of which he had hoped to be the exciter, were already given.



<P>But his intention, the kindness of his intention,



<P>was thankfully acknowledged:&nbsp; quite thankfully and warmly,



<P>for she was elevated beyond the common timidity of her



<P>mind by the flow of her love for William.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This dear William would soon be amongst them.&nbsp; There could



<P>be no doubt of his obtaining leave of absence immediately,



<P>for he was still only a midshipman; and as his parents,



<P>from living on the spot, must already have seen him,



<P>and be seeing him perhaps daily, his direct holidays



<P>might with justice be instantly given to the sister,



<P>who had been his best correspondent through a period of



<P>seven years, and the uncle who had done most for his support



<P>and advancement; and accordingly the reply to her reply,



<P>fixing a very early day for his arrival, came as soon



<P>as possible; and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny



<P>had been in the agitation of her first dinner-visit,



<P>when she found herself in an agitation of a higher nature,



<P>watching in the hall, in the lobby, on the stairs,



<P>for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her



<P>a brother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It came happily while she was thus waiting; and there



<P>being neither ceremony nor fearfulness to delay the moment



<P>of meeting, she was with him as he entered the house,



<P>and the first minutes of exquisite feeling had no interruption



<P>and no witnesses, unless the servants chiefly intent



<P>upon opening the proper doors could be called such.



<P>This was exactly what Sir Thomas and Edmund had been



<P>separately conniving at, as each proved to the other



<P>by the sympathetic alacrity with which they both advised



<P>Mrs. Norris's continuing where she was, instead of rushing



<P>out into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival



<P>reached them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>William and Fanny soon shewed themselves; and Sir Thomas



<P>had the pleasure of receiving, in his protege, certainly a



<P>very different person from the one he had equipped seven



<P>years ago, but a young man of an open, pleasant countenance,



<P>and frank, unstudied, but feeling and respectful manners,



<P>and such as confirmed him his friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was long before Fanny could recover from the agitating



<P>happiness of such an hour as was formed by the last



<P>thirty minutes of expectation, and the first of fruition;



<P>it was some time even before her happiness could be said



<P>to make her happy, before the disappointment inseparable



<P>from the alteration of person had vanished, and she could



<P>see in him the same William as before, and talk to him,



<P>as her heart had been yearning to do through many



<P>a past year.&nbsp; That time, however, did gradually come,



<P>forwarded by an affection on his side as warm as her own,



<P>and much less encumbered by refinement or self-distrust.



<P>She was the first object of his love, but it was a love



<P>which his stronger spirits, and bolder temper, made it



<P>as natural for him to express as to feel.&nbsp; On the morrow



<P>they were walking about together with true enjoyment,



<P>and every succeeding morrow renewed a _tete-a-tete_



<P>which Sir Thomas could not but observe with complacency,



<P>even before Edmund had pointed it out to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Excepting the moments of peculiar delight, which any marked



<P>or unlooked-for instance of Edmund's consideration of her



<P>in the last few months had excited, Fanny had never known



<P>so much felicity in her life, as in this unchecked, equal,



<P>fearless intercourse with the brother and friend who was opening



<P>all his heart to her, telling her all his hopes and fears,



<P>plans, and solicitudes respecting that long thought of,



<P>dearly earned, and justly valued blessing of promotion;



<P>who could give her direct and minute information of the



<P>father and mother, brothers and sisters, of whom she



<P>very seldom heard; who was interested in all the comforts



<P>and all the little hardships of her home at Mansfield;



<P>ready to think of every member of that home as she directed,



<P>or differing only by a less scrupulous opinion, and more



<P>noisy abuse of their aunt Norris, and with whom (perhaps



<P>the dearest indulgence of the whole) all the evil and



<P>good of their earliest years could be gone over again,



<P>and every former united pain and pleasure retraced



<P>with the fondest recollection.&nbsp; An advantage this,



<P>a strengthener of love, in which even the conjugal tie



<P>is beneath the fraternal.&nbsp; Children of the same family,



<P>the same blood, with the same first associations and habits,



<P>have some means of enjoyment in their power, which no



<P>subsequent connexions can supply; and it must be by a



<P>long and unnatural estrangement, by a divorce which no



<P>subsequent connexion can justify, if such precious remains



<P>of the earliest attachments are ever entirely outlived.



<P>Too often, alas! it is so.&nbsp; Fraternal love, sometimes



<P>almost everything, is at others worse than nothing.



<P>But with William and Fanny Price it was still a sentiment



<P>in all its prime and freshness, wounded by no opposition



<P>of interest, cooled by no separate attachment, and feeling



<P>the influence of time and absence only in its increase.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>An affection so amiable was advancing each in the opinion



<P>of all who had hearts to value anything good.&nbsp; Henry Crawford



<P>was as much struck with it as any.&nbsp; He honoured the



<P>warm-hearted, blunt fondness of the young sailor, which led



<P>him to say, with his hands stretched towards Fanny's head,



<P>"Do you know, I begin to like that queer fashion already,



<P>though when I first heard of such things being done



<P>in England, I could not believe it; and when Mrs. Brown,



<P>and the other women at the Commissioner's at Gibraltar,



<P>appeared in the same trim, I thought they were mad; but Fanny



<P>can reconcile me to anything"; and saw, with lively admiration,



<P>the glow of Fanny's cheek, the brightness of her eye,



<P>the deep interest, the absorbed attention, while her



<P>brother was describing any of the imminent hazards,



<P>or terrific scenes, which such a period at sea must supply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a picture which Henry Crawford had moral taste enough



<P>to value.&nbsp; Fanny's attractions increased--increased twofold;



<P>for the sensibility which beautified her complexion and



<P>illumined her countenance was an attraction in itself.



<P>He was no longer in doubt of the capabilities of her heart.



<P>She had feeling, genuine feeling.&nbsp; It would be something



<P>to be loved by such a girl, to excite the first ardours



<P>of her young unsophisticated mind!&nbsp; She interested him



<P>more than he had foreseen.&nbsp; A fortnight was not enough.



<P>His stay became indefinite.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>William was often called on by his uncle to be the talker.



<P>His recitals were amusing in themselves to Sir Thomas,



<P>but the chief object in seeking them was to understand



<P>the reciter, to know the young man by his histories;



<P>and he listened to his clear, simple, spirited details with



<P>full satisfaction, seeing in them the proof of good principles,



<P>professional knowledge, energy, courage, and cheerfulness,



<P>everything that could deserve or promise well.



<P>Young as he was, William had already seen a great deal.



<P>He had been in the Mediterranean; in the West Indies;



<P>in the Mediterranean again; had been often taken on shore



<P>by the favour of his captain, and in the course of seven



<P>years had known every variety of danger which sea and war



<P>together could offer.&nbsp; With such means in his power he



<P>had a right to be listened to; and though Mrs. Norris could



<P>fidget about the room, and disturb everybody in quest



<P>of two needlefuls of thread or a second-hand shirt button,



<P>in the midst of her nephew's account of a shipwreck



<P>or an engagement, everybody else was attentive; and even



<P>Lady Bertram could not hear of such horrors unmoved,



<P>or without sometimes lifting her eyes from her work to say,



<P>"Dear me! how disagreeable!&nbsp; I wonder anybody can ever go



<P>to sea."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To Henry Crawford they gave a different feeling.&nbsp; He longed



<P>to have been at sea, and seen and done and suffered as much.



<P>His heart was warmed, his fancy fired, and he felt



<P>the highest respect for a lad who, before he was twenty,



<P>had gone through such bodily hardships and given such



<P>proofs of mind.&nbsp; The glory of heroism, of usefulness,



<P>of exertion, of endurance, made his own habits of selfish



<P>indulgence appear in shameful contrast; and he wished



<P>he had been a William Price, distinguishing himself and



<P>working his way to fortune and consequence with so much



<P>self-respect and happy ardour, instead of what he was!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The wish was rather eager than lasting.&nbsp; He was roused from



<P>the reverie of retrospection and regret produced by it,



<P>by some inquiry from Edmund as to his plans for the next



<P>day's hunting; and he found it was as well to be a man



<P>of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his command.



<P>In one respect it was better, as it gave him the means



<P>of conferring a kindness where he wished to oblige.



<P>With spirits, courage, and curiosity up to anything,



<P>William expressed an inclination to hunt; and Crawford could



<P>mount him without the slightest inconvenience to himself,



<P>and with only some scruples to obviate in Sir Thomas,



<P>who knew better than his nephew the value of such a loan,



<P>and some alarms to reason away in Fanny.&nbsp; She feared



<P>for William; by no means convinced by all that he could



<P>relate of his own horsemanship in various countries,



<P>of the scrambling parties in which he had been engaged,



<P>the rough horses and mules he had ridden, or his many narrow



<P>escapes from dreadful falls, that he was at all equal to the



<P>management of a high-fed hunter in an English fox-chase;



<P>nor till he returned safe and well, without accident



<P>or discredit, could she be reconciled to the risk,



<P>or feel any of that obligation to Mr. Crawford for lending



<P>the horse which he had fully intended it should produce.



<P>When it was proved, however, to have done William no harm,



<P>she could allow it to be a kindness, and even reward



<P>the owner with a smile when the animal was one minute



<P>tendered to his use again; and the next, with the



<P>greatest cordiality, and in a manner not to be resisted,



<P>made over to his use entirely so long as he remained



<P>in Northamptonshire.

<B>CHAPTER XVIII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Everything was now in a regular train:&nbsp; theatre, actors,



<P>actresses, and dresses, were all getting forward;



<P>but though no other great impediments arose, Fanny found,



<P>before many days were past, that it was not all uninterrupted



<P>enjoyment to the party themselves, and that she had



<P>not to witness the continuance of such unanimity and



<P>delight as had been almost too much for her at first.



<P>Everybody began to have their vexation.&nbsp; Edmund had many.



<P>Entirely against _his_ judgment, a scene-painter arrived



<P>from town, and was at work, much to the increase



<P>of the expenses, and, what was worse, of the eclat of



<P>their proceedings; and his brother, instead of being really



<P>guided by him as to the privacy of the representation,



<P>was giving an invitation to every family who came in his way.



<P>Tom himself began to fret over the scene-painter's



<P>slow progress, and to feel the miseries of waiting.



<P>He had learned his part--all his parts, for he took



<P>every trifling one that could be united with the Butler,



<P>and began to be impatient to be acting; and every day



<P>thus unemployed was tending to increase his sense of



<P>the insignificance of all his parts together, and make



<P>him more ready to regret that some other play had not been chosen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, being always a very courteous listener, and often



<P>the only listener at hand, came in for the complaints



<P>and the distresses of most of them.&nbsp; _She_ knew that



<P>Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant dreadfully;



<P>that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford;



<P>that Tom Bertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible;



<P>that Mrs. Grant spoiled everything by laughing; that Edmund



<P>was behindhand with his part, and that it was misery



<P>to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth, who was wanting



<P>a prompter through every speech.&nbsp; She knew, also, that poor



<P>Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him:



<P>_his_ complaint came before her as well as the rest;



<P>and so decided to her eye was her cousin Maria's



<P>avoidance of him, and so needlessly often the rehearsal



<P>of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford, that she



<P>had soon all the terror of other complaints from _him_.



<P>So far from being all satisfied and all enjoying,



<P>she found everybody requiring something they had not,



<P>and giving occasion of discontent to the others.



<P>Everybody had a part either too long or too short;



<P>nobody would attend as they ought; nobody would remember on



<P>which side they were to come in; nobody but the complainer



<P>would observe any directions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment



<P>from the play as any of them; Henry Crawford acted well,



<P>and it was a pleasure to _her_ to creep into the theatre,



<P>and attend the rehearsal of the first act, in spite of the



<P>feelings it excited in some speeches for Maria.&nbsp; Maria, she



<P>also thought, acted well, too well; and after the first



<P>rehearsal or two, Fanny began to be their only audience;



<P>and sometimes as prompter, sometimes as spectator,



<P>was often very useful.&nbsp; As far as she could judge,



<P>Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor of all:



<P>he had more confidence than Edmund, more judgment than Tom,



<P>more talent and taste than Mr. Yates.&nbsp; She did not like him



<P>as a man, but she must admit him to be the best actor,



<P>and on this point there were not many who differed from her.



<P>Mr. Yates, indeed, exclaimed against his tameness



<P>and insipidity; and the day came at last, when Mr. Rushworth



<P>turned to her with a black look, and said, "Do you think



<P>there is anything so very fine in all this?&nbsp; For the life



<P>and soul of me, I cannot admire him; and, between ourselves,



<P>to see such an undersized, little, mean-looking man,



<P>set up for a fine actor, is very ridiculous in my opinion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From this moment there was a return of his former jealousy,



<P>which Maria, from increasing hopes of Crawford, was at



<P>little pains to remove; and the chances of Mr. Rushworth's



<P>ever attaining to the knowledge of his two-and-forty



<P>speeches became much less.&nbsp; As to his ever making anything



<P>_tolerable_ of them, nobody had the smallest idea of that



<P>except his mother; _she_, indeed, regretted that his part



<P>was not more considerable, and deferred coming over to



<P>Mansfield till they were forward enough in their rehearsal



<P>to comprehend all his scenes; but the others aspired at



<P>nothing beyond his remembering the catchword, and the first



<P>line of his speech, and being able to follow the prompter



<P>through the rest.&nbsp; Fanny, in her pity and kindheartedness,



<P>was at great pains to teach him how to learn, giving him



<P>all the helps and directions in her power, trying to make



<P>an artificial memory for him, and learning every word



<P>of his part herself, but without his being much the forwarder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Many uncomfortable, anxious, apprehensive feelings she



<P>certainly had; but with all these, and other claims



<P>on her time and attention, she was as far from finding



<P>herself without employment or utility amongst them,



<P>as without a companion in uneasiness; quite as far from



<P>having no demand on her leisure as on her compassion.



<P>The gloom of her first anticipations was proved to have



<P>been unfounded.&nbsp; She was occasionally useful to all;



<P>she was perhaps as much at peace as any.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a great deal of needlework to be done, moreover,



<P>in which her help was wanted; and that Mrs. Norris



<P>thought her quite as well off as the rest, was evident



<P>by the manner in which she claimed it--"Come, Fanny,"



<P>she cried, "these are fine times for you, but you must



<P>not be always walking from one room to the other,



<P>and doing the lookings-on at your ease, in this way;



<P>I want you here.&nbsp; I have been slaving myself till I



<P>can hardly stand, to contrive Mr. Rushworth's cloak



<P>without sending for any more satin; and now I think



<P>you may give me your help in putting it together.



<P>There are but three seams; you may do them in a trice.



<P>It would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive



<P>part to do.&nbsp; _You_ are best off, I can tell you:



<P>but if nobody did more than _you_, we should not get on



<P>very fast"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny took the work very quietly, without attempting



<P>any defence; but her kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"One cannot wonder, sister, that Fanny _should_ be delighted:



<P>it is all new to her, you know; you and I used to be



<P>very fond of a play ourselves, and so am I still;



<P>and as soon as I am a little more at leisure, _I_ mean



<P>to look in at their rehearsals too.&nbsp; What is the play about,



<P>Fanny? you have never told me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! sister, pray do not ask her now; for Fanny is not



<P>one of those who can talk and work at the same time.



<P>It is about Lovers' Vows."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I believe," said Fanny to her aunt Bertram, "there will



<P>be three acts rehearsed to-morrow evening, and that will



<P>give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You had better stay till the curtain is hung," interposed



<P>Mrs. Norris; "the curtain will be hung in a day or two--



<P>there is very little sense in a play without a curtain--



<P>and I am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up



<P>into very handsome festoons."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting.&nbsp; Fanny did



<P>not share her aunt's composure:&nbsp; she thought of the morrow



<P>a great deal, for if the three acts were rehearsed,



<P>Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be acting together



<P>for the first time; the third act would bring a scene



<P>between them which interested her most particularly,



<P>and which she was longing and dreading to see how they



<P>would perform.&nbsp; The whole subject of it was love--



<P>a marriage of love was to be described by the gentleman,



<P>and very little short of a declaration of love be made by



<P>the lady.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had read and read the scene again with many painful,



<P>many wondering emotions, and looked forward to their



<P>representation of it as a circumstance almost too interesting.



<P>She did not _believe_ they had yet rehearsed it,



<P>even in private.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The morrow came, the plan for the evening continued,



<P>and Fanny's consideration of it did not become less agitated.



<P>She worked very diligently under her aunt's directions,



<P>but her diligence and her silence concealed a very absent,



<P>anxious mind; and about noon she made her escape with her



<P>work to the East room, that she might have no concern



<P>in another, and, as she deemed it, most unnecessary



<P>rehearsal of the first act, which Henry Crawford was



<P>just proposing, desirous at once of having her time



<P>to herself, and of avoiding the sight of Mr. Rushworth.



<P>A glimpse, as she passed through the hall, of the two



<P>ladies walking up from the Parsonage made no change



<P>in her wish of retreat, and she worked and meditated



<P>in the East room, undisturbed, for a quarter of an hour,



<P>when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the entrance



<P>of Miss Crawford.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Am I right?&nbsp; Yes; this is the East room.&nbsp; My dear



<P>Miss Price, I beg your pardon, but I have made my way



<P>to you on purpose to entreat your help."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, quite surprised, endeavoured to shew herself



<P>mistress of the room by her civilities, and looked



<P>at the bright bars of her empty grate with concern.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you; I am quite warm, very warm.&nbsp; Allow me to stay



<P>here a little while, and do have the goodness to hear me



<P>my third act.&nbsp; I have brought my book, and if you would



<P>but rehearse it with me, I should be _so_ obliged!



<P>I came here to-day intending to rehearse it with Edmund--



<P>by ourselves--against the evening, but he is not in the way;



<P>and if he _were_, I do not think I could go through



<P>it with _him_, till I have hardened myself a little;



<P>for really there is a speech or two.&nbsp; You will be so good,



<P>won't you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny was most civil in her assurances, though she could



<P>not give them in a very steady voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean?"



<P>continued Miss Crawford, opening her book.&nbsp; "Here it is.



<P>I did not think much of it at first--but, upon my word.



<P>There, look at _that_ speech, and _that_, and _that_.



<P>How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things?



<P>Could you do it?&nbsp; But then he is your cousin, which makes



<P>all the difference.&nbsp; You must rehearse it with me, that I



<P>may fancy _you_ him, and get on by degrees.&nbsp; You _have_ a look



<P>of _his_ sometimes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have I?&nbsp; I will do my best with the greatest readiness;



<P>but I must _read_ the part, for I can say very little



<P>of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"_None_ of it, I suppose.&nbsp; You are to have the book,



<P>of course.&nbsp; Now for it.&nbsp; We must have two chairs at hand



<P>for you to bring forward to the front of the stage.



<P>There--very good school-room chairs, not made for a theatre,



<P>I dare say; much more fitted for little girls to sit and



<P>kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson.



<P>What would your governess and your uncle say to see them



<P>used for such a purpose?&nbsp; Could Sir Thomas look in upon us



<P>just now, he would bless himself, for we are rehearsing



<P>all over the house.&nbsp; Yates is storming away in the



<P>dining-room. I heard him as I came upstairs, and the theatre



<P>is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers,



<P>Agatha and Frederick.&nbsp; If _they_ are not perfect,



<P>I _shall_ be surprised.&nbsp; By the bye, I looked in upon



<P>them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at



<P>one of the times when they were trying _not_ to embrace,



<P>and Mr. Rushworth was with me.&nbsp; I thought he began to look



<P>a little queer, so I turned it off as well as I could,



<P>by whispering to him, 'We shall have an excellent Agatha;



<P>there is something so _maternal_ in her manner,



<P>so completely _maternal_ in her voice and countenance.'



<P>Was not that well done of me?&nbsp; He brightened up directly.



<P>Now for my soliloquy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She began, and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling



<P>which the idea of representing Edmund was so strongly



<P>calculated to inspire; but with looks and voice so truly



<P>feminine as to be no very good picture of a man.&nbsp; With such



<P>an Anhalt, however, Miss Crawford had courage enough;



<P>and they had got through half the scene, when a tap at



<P>the door brought a pause, and the entrance of Edmund,



<P>the next moment, suspended it all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Surprise, consciousness, and pleasure appeared in each



<P>of the three on this unexpected meeting; and as Edmund



<P>was come on the very same business that had brought



<P>Miss Crawford, consciousness and pleasure were likely



<P>to be more than momentary in _them_.&nbsp; He too had his book,



<P>and was seeking Fanny, to ask her to rehearse with him,



<P>and help him to prepare for the evening, without knowing



<P>Miss Crawford to be in the house; and great was the joy and



<P>animation of being thus thrown together, of comparing schemes,



<P>and sympathising in praise of Fanny's kind offices.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>_She_ could not equal them in their warmth.&nbsp; _Her_ spirits



<P>sank under the glow of theirs, and she felt herself becoming



<P>too nearly nothing to both to have any comfort in having



<P>been sought by either.&nbsp; They must now rehearse together.



<P>Edmund proposed, urged, entreated it, till the lady,



<P>not very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer,



<P>and Fanny was wanted only to prompt and observe them.



<P>She was invested, indeed, with the office of judge and critic,



<P>and earnestly desired to exercise it and tell them all



<P>their faults; but from doing so every feeling within



<P>her shrank--she could not, would not, dared not attempt it:



<P>had she been otherwise qualified for criticism, her conscience



<P>must have restrained her from venturing at disapprobation.



<P>She believed herself to feel too much of it in the aggregate



<P>for honesty or safety in particulars.&nbsp; To prompt them must



<P>be enough for her; and it was sometimes _more_ than enough;



<P>for she could not always pay attention to the book.



<P>In watching them she forgot herself; and, agitated by the



<P>increasing spirit of Edmund's manner, had once closed



<P>the page and turned away exactly as he wanted help.



<P>It was imputed to very reasonable weariness, and she was



<P>thanked and pitied; but she deserved their pity more than



<P>she hoped they would ever surmise.&nbsp; At last the scene



<P>was over, and Fanny forced herself to add her praise to



<P>the compliments each was giving the other; and when again



<P>alone and able to recall the whole, she was inclined



<P>to believe their performance would, indeed, have such



<P>nature and feeling in it as must ensure their credit,



<P>and make it a very suffering exhibition to herself.



<P>Whatever might be its effect, however, she must stand



<P>the brunt of it again that very day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The first regular rehearsal of the three first acts



<P>was certainly to take place in the evening:&nbsp; Mrs. Grant



<P>and the Crawfords were engaged to return for that purpose



<P>as soon as they could after dinner; and every one concerned



<P>was looking forward with eagerness.&nbsp; There seemed



<P>a general diffusion of cheerfulness on the occasion.



<P>Tom was enjoying such an advance towards the end;



<P>Edmund was in spirits from the morning's rehearsal,



<P>and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed away.



<P>All were alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon,



<P>the gentlemen soon followed them, and with the exception



<P>of Lady Bertram, Mrs. Norris, and Julia, everybody was



<P>in the theatre at an early hour; and having lighted it up



<P>as well as its unfinished state admitted, were waiting only



<P>the arrival of Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They did not wait long for the Crawfords, but there



<P>was no Mrs. Grant.&nbsp; She could not come.&nbsp; Dr. Grant,



<P>professing an indisposition, for which he had little credit



<P>with his fair sister-in-law, could not spare his wife.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dr. Grant is ill," said she, with mock solemnity.



<P>"He has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the



<P>pheasant today.&nbsp; He fancied it tough, sent away his plate,



<P>and has been suffering ever since".

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here was disappointment!&nbsp; Mrs. Grant's non-attendance



<P>was sad indeed.&nbsp; Her pleasant manners and cheerful



<P>conformity made her always valuable amongst them;



<P>but _now_ she was absolutely necessary.&nbsp; They could not act,



<P>they could not rehearse with any satisfaction without her.



<P>The comfort of the whole evening was destroyed.



<P>What was to be done?&nbsp; Tom, as Cottager, was in despair.



<P>After a pause of perplexity, some eyes began to be



<P>turned towards Fanny, and a voice or two to say,



<P>"If Miss Price would be so good as to _read_ the part."



<P>She was immediately surrounded by supplications;



<P>everybody asked it; even Edmund said, "Do, Fanny, if it is



<P>not _very_ disagreeable to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Fanny still hung back.&nbsp; She could not endure the idea



<P>of it.&nbsp; Why was not Miss Crawford to be applied to as well?



<P>Or why had not she rather gone to her own room,



<P>as she had felt to be safest, instead of attending



<P>the rehearsal at all?&nbsp; She had known it would irritate



<P>and distress her; she had known it her duty to keep away.



<P>She was properly punished.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have only to _read_ the part," said Henry Crawford,



<P>with renewed entreaty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I do believe she can say every word of it,"



<P>added Maria, "for she could put Mrs. Grant right the other



<P>day in twenty places.&nbsp; Fanny, I am sure you know the part."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny could not say she did _not_; and as they all persevered,



<P>as Edmund repeated his wish, and with a look of even



<P>fond dependence on her good-nature, she must yield.



<P>She would do her best.&nbsp; Everybody was satisfied; and she



<P>was left to the tremors of a most palpitating heart,



<P>while the others prepared to begin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They _did_ begin; and being too much engaged in their



<P>own noise to be struck by an unusual noise in the other



<P>part of the house, had proceeded some way when the door



<P>of the room was thrown open, and Julia, appearing at it,



<P>with a face all aghast, exclaimed, "My father is come!



<P>He is in the hall at this moment."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Fanny had by no means forgotten Mr. Crawford when she



<P>awoke the next morning; but she remembered the purport



<P>of her note, and was not less sanguine as to its effect



<P>than she had been the night before.&nbsp; If Mr. Crawford would



<P>but go away!&nbsp; That was what she most earnestly desired:



<P>go and take his sister with him, as he was to do,



<P>and as he returned to Mansfield on purpose to do.



<P>And why it was not done already she could not devise,



<P>for Miss Crawford certainly wanted no delay.&nbsp; Fanny had hoped,



<P>in the course of his yesterday's visit, to hear the day named;



<P>but he had only spoken of their journey as what would take



<P>place ere long.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note



<P>would convey, she could not but be astonished to see



<P>Mr. Crawford, as she accidentally did, coming up to the



<P>house again, and at an hour as early as the day before.



<P>His coming might have nothing to do with her, but she



<P>must avoid seeing him if possible; and being then



<P>on her way upstairs, she resolved there to remain,



<P>during the whole of his visit, unless actually sent for;



<P>and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house, there seemed



<P>little danger of her being wanted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She sat some time in a good deal of agitation, listening,



<P>trembling, and fearing to be sent for every moment;



<P>but as no footsteps approached the East room, she grew



<P>gradually composed, could sit down, and be able to



<P>employ herself, and able to hope that Mr. Crawford had come



<P>and would go without her being obliged to know anything of the



<P>matter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nearly half an hour had passed, and she was growing



<P>very comfortable, when suddenly the sound of a step



<P>in regular approach was heard; a heavy step, an unusual



<P>step in that part of the house:&nbsp; it was her uncle's;



<P>she knew it as well as his voice; she had trembled at it



<P>as often, and began to tremble again, at the idea of his



<P>coming up to speak to her, whatever might be the subject.



<P>It was indeed Sir Thomas who opened the door and asked



<P>if she were there, and if he might come in.&nbsp; The terror



<P>of his former occasional visits to that room seemed



<P>all renewed, and she felt as if he were going to examine



<P>her again in French and English.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was all attention, however, in placing a chair for him,



<P>and trying to appear honoured; and, in her agitation,



<P>had quite overlooked the deficiencies of her apartment, till he,



<P>stopping short as he entered, said, with much surprise,



<P>"Why have you no fire to-day?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was snow on the ground, and she was sitting in a shawl.



<P>She hesitated.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am not cold, sir:&nbsp; I never sit here long at this time



<P>of year."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you have a fire in general?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How comes this about?&nbsp; Here must be some mistake.



<P>I understood that you had the use of this room by way



<P>of making you perfectly comfortable.&nbsp; In your bedchamber



<P>I know you _cannot_ have a fire.&nbsp; Here is some great



<P>misapprehension which must be rectified.&nbsp; It is highly



<P>unfit for you to sit, be it only half an hour a day,



<P>without a fire.&nbsp; You are not strong.&nbsp; You are chilly.



<P>Your aunt cannot be aware of this."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny would rather have been silent; but being obliged



<P>to speak, she could not forbear, in justice to the aunt



<P>she loved best, from saying something in which the words



<P>"my aunt Norris" were distinguishable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I understand," cried her uncle, recollecting himself,



<P>and not wanting to hear more:&nbsp; "I understand.&nbsp; Your aunt



<P>Norris has always been an advocate, and very judiciously,



<P>for young people's being brought up without unnecessary



<P>indulgences; but there should be moderation in everything.



<P>She is also very hardy herself, which of course will



<P>influence her in her opinion of the wants of others.



<P>And on another account, too, I can perfectly comprehend.



<P>I know what her sentiments have always been.



<P>The principle was good in itself, but it may have been,



<P>and I believe _has_ _been_, carried too far in your case.



<P>I am aware that there has been sometimes, in some points,



<P>a misplaced distinction; but I think too well of you, Fanny,



<P>to suppose you will ever harbour resentment on that account.



<P>You have an understanding which will prevent you from



<P>receiving things only in part, and judging partially



<P>by the event.&nbsp; You will take in the whole of the past,



<P>you will consider times, persons, and probabilities,



<P>and you will feel that _they_ were not least your



<P>friends who were educating and preparing you for that



<P>mediocrity of condition which _seemed_ to be your lot.



<P>Though their caution may prove eventually unnecessary,



<P>it was kindly meant; and of this you may be assured,



<P>that every advantage of affluence will be doubled by the little



<P>privations and restrictions that may have been imposed.



<P>I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you,



<P>by failing at any time to treat your aunt Norris



<P>with the respect and attention that are due to her.



<P>But enough of this.&nbsp; Sit down, my dear.&nbsp; I must speak



<P>to you for a few minutes, but I will not detain



<P>you long."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny obeyed, with eyes cast down and colour rising.



<P>After a moment's pause, Sir Thomas, trying to suppress



<P>a smile, went on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are not aware, perhaps, that I have had a visitor



<P>this morning.&nbsp; I had not been long in my own room,



<P>after breakfast, when Mr. Crawford was shewn in.



<P>His errand you may probably conjecture."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny's colour grew deeper and deeper; and her uncle,



<P>perceiving that she was embarrassed to a degree that



<P>made either speaking or looking up quite impossible,



<P>turned away his own eyes, and without any farther pause



<P>proceeded in his account of Mr. Crawford's visit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Crawford's business had been to declare himself



<P>the lover of Fanny, make decided proposals for her,



<P>and entreat the sanction of the uncle, who seemed to stand



<P>in the place of her parents; and he had done it all so well,



<P>so openly, so liberally, so properly, that Sir Thomas,



<P>feeling, moreover, his own replies, and his own remarks



<P>to have been very much to the purpose, was exceedingly



<P>happy to give the particulars of their conversation;



<P>and little aware of what was passing in his niece's mind,



<P>conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her



<P>far more than himself.&nbsp; He talked, therefore, for several



<P>minutes without Fanny's daring to interrupt him.



<P>She had hardly even attained the wish to do it.&nbsp; Her mind



<P>was in too much confusion.&nbsp; She had changed her position;



<P>and, with her eyes fixed intently on one of the windows,



<P>was listening to her uncle in the utmost perturbation



<P>and dismay.&nbsp; For a moment he ceased, but she had barely



<P>become conscious of it, when, rising from his chair, he said,



<P>"And now, Fanny, having performed one part of my commission,



<P>and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured



<P>and satisfactory, I may execute the remainder by prevailing



<P>on you to accompany me downstairs, where, though I cannot



<P>but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself,



<P>I must submit to your finding one still better worth



<P>listening to.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford, as you have perhaps foreseen,



<P>is yet in the house.&nbsp; He is in my room, and hoping to see



<P>you there."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a look, a start, an exclamation on hearing this,



<P>which astonished Sir Thomas; but what was his increase of



<P>astonishment on hearing her exclaim--"Oh! no, sir, I cannot,



<P>indeed I cannot go down to him.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford ought to know--



<P>he must know that:&nbsp; I told him enough yesterday to convince him;



<P>he spoke to me on this subject yesterday, and I told him



<P>without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me,



<P>and quite out of my power to return his good opinion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not catch your meaning," said Sir Thomas, sitting



<P>down again.&nbsp; "Out of your power to return his good opinion?



<P>What is all this?&nbsp; I know he spoke to you yesterday,



<P>and (as far as I understand) received as much encouragement



<P>to proceed as a well-judging young woman could permit



<P>herself to give.&nbsp; I was very much pleased with what I



<P>collected to have been your behaviour on the occasion;



<P>it shewed a discretion highly to be commended.&nbsp; But now,



<P>when he has made his overtures so properly, and honourably--



<P>what are your scruples _now_?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are mistaken, sir," cried Fanny, forced by the anxiety



<P>of the moment even to tell her uncle that he was wrong;



<P>"you are quite mistaken.&nbsp; How could Mr. Crawford say



<P>such a thing?&nbsp; I gave him no encouragement yesterday.



<P>On the contrary, I told him, I cannot recollect my exact words,



<P>but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him,



<P>that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect, and that



<P>I begged him never to talk to me in that manner again.



<P>I am sure I said as much as that and more; and I should



<P>have said still more, if I had been quite certain of his



<P>meaning anything seriously; but I did not like to be,



<P>I could not bear to be, imputing more than might be intended.



<P>I thought it might all pass for nothing with _him_."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could say no more; her breath was almost gone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Am I to understand," said Sir Thomas, after a few moments'



<P>silence, "that you mean to _refuse_ Mr. Crawford?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Refuse him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Refuse Mr. Crawford!&nbsp; Upon what plea?&nbsp; For what reason?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I--I cannot like him, sir, well enough to marry him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is very strange!" said Sir Thomas, in a voice of



<P>calm displeasure.&nbsp; "There is something in this which my



<P>comprehension does not reach.&nbsp; Here is a young man wishing



<P>to pay his addresses to you, with everything to recommend him:



<P>not merely situation in life, fortune, and character,



<P>but with more than common agreeableness, with address



<P>and conversation pleasing to everybody.&nbsp; And he is not an



<P>acquaintance of to-day; you have now known him some time.



<P>His sister, moreover, is your intimate friend, and he has



<P>been doing _that_ for your brother, which I should suppose



<P>would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you,



<P>had there been no other.&nbsp; It is very uncertain when my



<P>interest might have got William on.&nbsp; He has done it already."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Fanny, in a faint voice, and looking down



<P>with fresh shame; and she did feel almost ashamed



<P>of herself, after such a picture as her uncle had drawn,



<P>for not liking Mr. Crawford.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You must have been aware," continued Sir Thomas presently,



<P>"you must have been some time aware of a particularity



<P>in Mr. Crawford's manners to you.&nbsp; This cannot have taken



<P>you by surprise.&nbsp; You must have observed his attentions;



<P>and though you always received them very properly (I have



<P>no accusation to make on that head), I never perceived them



<P>to be unpleasant to you.&nbsp; I am half inclined to think,



<P>Fanny, that you do not quite know your own feelings."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh yes, sir! indeed I do.&nbsp; His attentions were always--



<P>what I did not like."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas looked at her with deeper surprise.



<P>"This is beyond me," said he.&nbsp; "This requires explanation.



<P>Young as you are, and having seen scarcely any one,



<P>it is hardly possible that your affections--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He paused and eyed her fixedly.&nbsp; He saw her lips



<P>formed into a _no_, though the sound was inarticulate,



<P>but her face was like scarlet.&nbsp; That, however, in so



<P>modest a girl, might be very compatible with innocence;



<P>and chusing at least to appear satisfied, he quickly added,



<P>"No, no, I know _that_ is quite out of the question;



<P>quite impossible.&nbsp; Well, there is nothing more to be said."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And for a few minutes he did say nothing.&nbsp; He was deep



<P>in thought.&nbsp; His niece was deep in thought likewise, trying to



<P>harden and prepare herself against farther questioning.



<P>She would rather die than own the truth; and she hoped,



<P>by a little reflection, to fortify herself beyond



<P>betraying it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford's _choice_



<P>seemed to justify" said Sir Thomas, beginning again,



<P>and very composedly, "his wishing to marry at all so



<P>early is recommendatory to me.&nbsp; I am an advocate for



<P>early marriages, where there are means in proportion,



<P>and would have every young man, with a sufficient income,



<P>settle as soon after four-and-twenty as he can.&nbsp; This is



<P>so much my opinion, that I am sorry to think how little



<P>likely my own eldest son, your cousin, Mr. Bertram,



<P>is to marry early; but at present, as far as I can judge,



<P>matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts.



<P>I wish he were more likely to fix."&nbsp; Here was a glance



<P>at Fanny.&nbsp; "Edmund, I consider, from his dispositions



<P>and habits, as much more likely to marry early than



<P>his brother.&nbsp; _He_, indeed, I have lately thought,



<P>has seen the woman he could love, which, I am convinced,



<P>my eldest son has not.&nbsp; Am I right?&nbsp; Do you agree with me,



<P>my dear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was gently, but it was calmly said, and Sir Thomas was



<P>easy on the score of the cousins.&nbsp; But the removal of his



<P>alarm did his niece no service:&nbsp; as her unaccountableness



<P>was confirmed his displeasure increased; and getting up



<P>and walking about the room with a frown, which Fanny could



<P>picture to herself, though she dared not lift up her eyes,



<P>he shortly afterwards, and in a voice of authority, said,



<P>"Have you any reason, child, to think ill of Mr. Crawford's



<P>temper?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She longed to add, "But of his principles I have"; but her



<P>heart sunk under the appalling prospect of discussion,



<P>explanation, and probably non-conviction. Her ill opinion



<P>of him was founded chiefly on observations, which,



<P>for her cousins' sake, she could scarcely dare mention



<P>to their father.&nbsp; Maria and Julia, and especially Maria,



<P>were so closely implicated in Mr. Crawford's misconduct,



<P>that she could not give his character, such as she



<P>believed it, without betraying them.&nbsp; She had hoped that,



<P>to a man like her uncle, so discerning, so honourable,



<P>so good, the simple acknowledgment of settled _dislike_



<P>on her side would have been sufficient.&nbsp; To her infinite



<P>grief she found it was not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas came towards the table where she sat



<P>in trembling wretchedness, and with a good deal of



<P>cold sternness, said, "It is of no use, I perceive,



<P>to talk to you.&nbsp; We had better put an end to this



<P>most mortifying conference.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford must not be



<P>kept longer waiting.&nbsp; I will, therefore, only add,



<P>as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct,



<P>that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed,



<P>and proved yourself of a character the very reverse



<P>of what I had supposed.&nbsp; For I _had_, Fanny, as I think



<P>my behaviour must have shewn, formed a very favourable



<P>opinion of you from the period of my return to England.



<P>I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper,



<P>self-conceit, and every tendency to that independence



<P>of spirit which prevails so much in modern days,



<P>even in young women, and which in young women is offensive



<P>and disgusting beyond all common offence.&nbsp; But you



<P>have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse;



<P>that you can and will decide for yourself, without any



<P>consideration or deference for those who have surely some



<P>right to guide you, without even asking their advice.



<P>You have shewn yourself very, very different from anything



<P>that I had imagined.&nbsp; The advantage or disadvantage of



<P>your family, of your parents, your brothers and sisters,



<P>never seems to have had a moment's share in your thoughts



<P>on this occasion.&nbsp; How _they_ might be benefited,



<P>how _they_ must rejoice in such an establishment for you,



<P>is nothing to _you_.&nbsp; You think only of yourself,



<P>and because you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a



<P>young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness,



<P>you resolve to refuse him at once, without wishing



<P>even for a little time to consider of it, a little more



<P>time for cool consideration, and for really examining



<P>your own inclinations; and are, in a wild fit of folly,



<P>throwing away from you such an opportunity of being



<P>settled in life, eligibly, honourably, nobly settled,



<P>as will, probably, never occur to you again.&nbsp; Here is a



<P>young man of sense, of character, of temper, of manners,



<P>and of fortune, exceedingly attached to you, and seeking



<P>your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way;



<P>and let me tell you, Fanny, that you may live eighteen years



<P>longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half



<P>Mr. Crawford's estate, or a tenth part of his merits.



<P>Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters



<P>on him.&nbsp; Maria is nobly married; but had Mr. Crawford



<P>sought Julia's hand, I should have given it to him with



<P>superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave



<P>Maria's to Mr. Rushworth."&nbsp; After half a moment's pause:



<P>"And I should have been very much surprised had either



<P>of my daughters, on receiving a proposal of marriage at any



<P>time which might carry with it only _half_ the eligibility



<P>of _this_, immediately and peremptorily, and without paying



<P>my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation,



<P>put a decided negative on it.&nbsp; I should have been much



<P>surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding.&nbsp; I should



<P>have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect.



<P>_You_ are not to be judged by the same rule.&nbsp; You do not



<P>owe me the duty of a child.&nbsp; But, Fanny, if your heart



<P>can acquit you of _ingratitude_--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He ceased.&nbsp; Fanny was by this time crying so bitterly that,



<P>angry as he was, he would not press that article farther.



<P>Her heart was almost broke by such a picture of what



<P>she appeared to him; by such accusations, so heavy,



<P>so multiplied, so rising in dreadful gradation!



<P>Self-willed, obstinate, selfish, and ungrateful.



<P>He thought her all this.&nbsp; She had deceived his expectations;



<P>she had lost his good opinion.&nbsp; What was to become



<P>of her?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am very sorry," said she inarticulately, through her tears,



<P>"I am very sorry indeed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sorry! yes, I hope you are sorry; and you will probably



<P>have reason to be long sorry for this day's transactions."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If it were possible for me to do otherwise" said she,



<P>with another strong effort; "but I am so perfectly



<P>convinced that I could never make him happy, and that I



<P>should be miserable myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another burst of tears; but in spite of that burst,



<P>and in spite of that great black word _miserable_,



<P>which served to introduce it, Sir Thomas began to think



<P>a little relenting, a little change of inclination,



<P>might have something to do with it; and to augur favourably



<P>from the personal entreaty of the young man himself.



<P>He knew her to be very timid, and exceedingly nervous;



<P>and thought it not improbable that her mind might be



<P>in such a state as a little time, a little pressing,



<P>a little patience, and a little impatience, a judicious



<P>mixture of all on the lover's side, might work their



<P>usual effect on.&nbsp; If the gentleman would but persevere,



<P>if he had but love enough to persevere, Sir Thomas began



<P>to have hopes; and these reflections having passed across



<P>his mind and cheered it, "Well," said he, in a tone



<P>of becoming gravity, but of less anger, "well, child,



<P>dry up your tears.&nbsp; There is no use in these tears;



<P>they can do no good.&nbsp; You must now come downstairs with me.



<P>Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting too long already.



<P>You must give him your own answer:&nbsp; we cannot expect him



<P>to be satisfied with less; and you only can explain to him



<P>the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments, which,



<P>unfortunately for himself, he certainly has imbibed.&nbsp; I am



<P>totally unequal to it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Fanny shewed such reluctance, such misery, at the



<P>idea of going down to him, that Sir Thomas, after a



<P>little consideration, judged it better to indulge her.



<P>His hopes from both gentleman and lady suffered a small



<P>depression in consequence; but when he looked at his niece,



<P>and saw the state of feature and complexion which her



<P>crying had brought her into, he thought there might



<P>be as much lost as gained by an immediate interview.



<P>With a few words, therefore, of no particular meaning,



<P>he walked off by himself, leaving his poor niece to sit



<P>and cry over what had passed, with very wretched feelings

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her mind was all disorder.&nbsp; The past, present, future,



<P>everything was terrible.&nbsp; But her uncle's anger gave



<P>her the severest pain of all.&nbsp; Selfish and ungrateful!



<P>to have appeared so to him!&nbsp; She was miserable for ever.



<P>She had no one to take her part, to counsel, or speak



<P>for her.&nbsp; Her only friend was absent.&nbsp; He might have



<P>softened his father; but all, perhaps all, would think



<P>her selfish and ungrateful.&nbsp; She might have to endure



<P>the reproach again and again; she might hear it, or see it,



<P>or know it to exist for ever in every connexion about her.



<P>She could not but feel some resentment against Mr. Crawford;



<P>yet, if he really loved her, and were unhappy too!



<P>It was all wretchedness together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In about a quarter of an hour her uncle returned;



<P>she was almost ready to faint at the sight of him.



<P>He spoke calmly, however, without austerity, without reproach,



<P>and she revived a little.&nbsp; There was comfort, too,



<P>in his words, as well as his manner, for he began with,



<P>"Mr. Crawford is gone:&nbsp; he has just left me.&nbsp; I need not



<P>repeat what has passed.&nbsp; I do not want to add to anything



<P>you may now be feeling, by an account of what he has felt.



<P>Suffice it, that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike



<P>and generous manner, and has confirmed me in a most



<P>favourable opinion of his understanding, heart, and temper.



<P>Upon my representation of what you were suffering,



<P>he immediately, and with the greatest delicacy,



<P>ceased to urge to see you for the present."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here Fanny, who had looked up, looked down again.&nbsp; "Of course,"



<P>continued her uncle, "it cannot be supposed but that he should



<P>request to speak with you alone, be it only for five minutes;



<P>a request too natural, a claim too just to be denied.



<P>But there is no time fixed; perhaps to-morrow, or whenever



<P>your spirits are composed enough.&nbsp; For the present you



<P>have only to tranquillise yourself.&nbsp; Check these tears;



<P>they do but exhaust you.&nbsp; If, as I am willing to suppose,



<P>you wish to shew me any observance, you will not give



<P>way to these emotions, but endeavour to reason yourself



<P>into a stronger frame of mind.&nbsp; I advise you to go out:



<P>the air will do you good; go out for an hour on the gravel;



<P>you will have the shrubbery to yourself, and will be the



<P>better for air and exercise.&nbsp; And, Fanny" (turning back



<P>again for a moment), "I shall make no mention below of



<P>what has passed; I shall not even tell your aunt Bertram.



<P>There is no occasion for spreading the disappointment;



<P>say nothing about it yourself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was an order to be most joyfully obeyed; this was



<P>an act of kindness which Fanny felt at her heart.



<P>To be spared from her aunt Norris's interminable



<P>reproaches! he left her in a glow of gratitude.



<P>Anything might be bearable rather than such reproaches.



<P>Even to see Mr. Crawford would be less overpowering.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She walked out directly, as her uncle recommended,



<P>and followed his advice throughout, as far as she could;



<P>did check her tears; did earnestly try to compose her spirits



<P>and strengthen her mind.&nbsp; She wished to prove to him that she



<P>did desire his comfort, and sought to regain his favour;



<P>and he had given her another strong motive for exertion,



<P>in keeping the whole affair from the knowledge of her aunts.



<P>Not to excite suspicion by her look or manner was now



<P>an object worth attaining; and she felt equal to almost



<P>anything that might save her from her aunt Norris.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was struck, quite struck, when, on returning from her



<P>walk and going into the East room again, the first thing



<P>which caught her eye was a fire lighted and burning.



<P>A fire! it seemed too much; just at that time to be giving



<P>her such an indulgence was exciting even painful gratitude.



<P>She wondered that Sir Thomas could have leisure to think



<P>of such a trifle again; but she soon found, from the voluntary



<P>information of the housemaid, who came in to attend it,



<P>that so it was to be every day.&nbsp; Sir Thomas had given



<P>orders for it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I must be a brute, indeed, if I can be really ungrateful!"



<P>said she, in soliloquy.&nbsp; "Heaven defend me from



<P>being ungrateful!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She saw nothing more of her uncle, nor of her aunt Norris,



<P>till they met at dinner.&nbsp; Her uncle's behaviour to her



<P>was then as nearly as possible what it had been before;



<P>she was sure he did not mean there should be any change,



<P>and that it was only her own conscience that could fancy any;



<P>but her aunt was soon quarrelling with her; and when she



<P>found how much and how unpleasantly her having only walked



<P>out without her aunt's knowledge could be dwelt on,



<P>she felt all the reason she had to bless the kindness



<P>which saved her from the same spirit of reproach,



<P>exerted on a more momentous subject.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I had known you were going out, I should have got you



<P>just to go as far as my house with some orders for Nanny,"



<P>said she, "which I have since, to my very great inconvenience,



<P>been obliged to go and carry myself.&nbsp; I could very ill



<P>spare the time, and you might have saved me the trouble,



<P>if you would only have been so good as to let us know you



<P>were going out.&nbsp; It would have made no difference to you,



<P>I suppose, whether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone



<P>to my house."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place,"



<P>said Sir Thomas.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!" said Mrs. Norris, with a moment's check,



<P>"that was very kind of you, Sir Thomas; but you do not



<P>know how dry the path is to my house.&nbsp; Fanny would have



<P>had quite as good a walk there, I assure you, with the



<P>advantage of being of some use, and obliging her aunt:



<P>it is all her fault.&nbsp; If she would but have let us know



<P>she was going out but there is a something about Fanny,



<P>I have often observed it before--she likes to go her



<P>own way to work; she does not like to be dictated to;



<P>she takes her own independent walk whenever she can;



<P>she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy, and independence,



<P>and nonsense, about her, which I would advise her to get



<P>the better of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As a general reflection on Fanny, Sir Thomas thought



<P>nothing could be more unjust, though he had been so lately



<P>expressing the same sentiments himself, and he tried to turn



<P>the conversation:&nbsp; tried repeatedly before he could succeed;



<P>for Mrs. Norris had not discernment enough to perceive,



<P>either now, or at any other time, to what degree he



<P>thought well of his niece, or how very far he was from



<P>wishing to have his own children's merits set off by



<P>the depreciation of hers.&nbsp; She was talking _at_ Fanny,



<P>and resenting this private walk half through the dinner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was over, however, at last; and the evening set in with



<P>more composure to Fanny, and more cheerfulness of spirits



<P>than she could have hoped for after so stormy a morning;



<P>but she trusted, in the first place, that she had done right:



<P>that her judgment had not misled her.&nbsp; For the purity



<P>of her intentions she could answer; and she was willing



<P>to hope, secondly, that her uncle's displeasure was abating,



<P>and would abate farther as he considered the matter with



<P>more impartiality, and felt, as a good man must feel,



<P>how wretched, and how unpardonable, how hopeless,



<P>and how wicked it was to marry without affection.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the meeting with which she was threatened for the



<P>morrow was past, she could not but flatter herself that



<P>the subject would be finally concluded, and Mr. Crawford



<P>once gone from Mansfield, that everything would soon



<P>be as if no such subject had existed.&nbsp; She would not,



<P>could not believe, that Mr. Crawford's affection for her



<P>could distress him long; his mind was not of that sort.



<P>London would soon bring its cure.&nbsp; In London he would



<P>soon learn to wonder at his infatuation, and be thankful



<P>for the right reason in her which had saved him from its



<P>evil consequences.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While Fanny's mind was engaged in these sort of hopes,



<P>her uncle was, soon after tea, called out of the room;



<P>an occurrence too common to strike her, and she thought nothing



<P>of it till the butler reappeared ten minutes afterwards,



<P>and advancing decidedly towards herself, said, "Sir Thomas



<P>wishes to speak with you, ma'am, in his own room."



<P>Then it occurred to her what might be going on; a suspicion



<P>rushed over her mind which drove the colour from her cheeks;



<P>but instantly rising, she was preparing to obey, when Mrs. Norris



<P>called out, "Stay, stay, Fanny! what are you about? where



<P>are you going? don't be in such a hurry.&nbsp; Depend upon it,



<P>it is not you who are wanted; depend upon it, it is me"



<P>(looking at the butler); "but you are so very eager to put



<P>yourself forward.&nbsp; What should Sir Thomas want you for?



<P>It is me, Baddeley, you mean; I am coming this moment.



<P>You mean me, Baddeley, I am sure; Sir Thomas wants me,



<P>not Miss Price."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Baddeley was stout.&nbsp; "No, ma'am, it is Miss Price;



<P>I am certain of its being Miss Price."&nbsp; And there was



<P>a half-smile with the words, which meant, "I do not think



<P>you would answer the purpose at all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris, much discontented, was obliged to compose



<P>herself to work again; and Fanny, walking off in



<P>agitating consciousness, found herself, as she anticipated,



<P>in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>William's desire of seeing Fanny dance made more than a



<P>momentary impression on his uncle.&nbsp; The hope of an opportunity,



<P>which Sir Thomas had then given, was not given to be thought



<P>of no more.&nbsp; He remained steadily inclined to gratify



<P>so amiable a feeling; to gratify anybody else who might



<P>wish to see Fanny dance, and to give pleasure to the young



<P>people in general; and having thought the matter over,



<P>and taken his resolution in quiet independence,



<P>the result of it appeared the next morning at breakfast,



<P>when, after recalling and commending what his nephew



<P>had said, he added, "I do not like, William, that you



<P>should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence.



<P>It would give me pleasure to see you both dance.



<P>You spoke of the balls at Northampton.&nbsp; Your cousins have



<P>occasionally attended them; but they would not altogether



<P>suit us now.&nbsp; The fatigue would be too much for your aunt.



<P>I believe we must not think of a Northampton ball.



<P>A dance at home would be more eligible; and if--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, my dear Sir Thomas!" interrupted Mrs. Norris, "I knew



<P>what was coming.&nbsp; I knew what you were going to say.&nbsp; If dear



<P>Julia were at home, or dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton,



<P>to afford a reason, an occasion for such a thing, you would



<P>be tempted to give the young people a dance at Mansfield.



<P>I know you would.&nbsp; If _they_ were at home to grace



<P>the ball, a ball you would have this very Christmas.



<P>Thank your uncle, William, thank your uncle!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My daughters," replied Sir Thomas, gravely interposing,



<P>"have their pleasures at Brighton, and I hope are very happy;



<P>but the dance which I think of giving at Mansfield



<P>will be for their cousins.&nbsp; Could we be all assembled,



<P>our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete,



<P>but the absence of some is not to debar the others



<P>of amusement."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris had not another word to say.&nbsp; She saw decision



<P>in his looks, and her surprise and vexation required



<P>some minutes' silence to be settled into composure.



<P>A ball at such a time!&nbsp; His daughters absent and herself



<P>not consulted!&nbsp; There was comfort, however, soon at hand.



<P>_She_ must be the doer of everything:&nbsp; Lady Bertram



<P>would of course be spared all thought and exertion,



<P>and it would all fall upon _her_.&nbsp; She should have to do



<P>the honours of the evening; and this reflection quickly



<P>restored so much of her good-humour as enabled her to join



<P>in with the others, before their happiness and thanks were



<P>all expressed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund, William, and Fanny did, in their different ways,



<P>look and speak as much grateful pleasure in the promised



<P>ball as Sir Thomas could desire.&nbsp; Edmund's feelings



<P>were for the other two.&nbsp; His father had never conferred



<P>a favour or shewn a kindness more to his satisfaction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Bertram was perfectly quiescent and contented,



<P>and had no objections to make.&nbsp; Sir Thomas engaged



<P>for its giving her very little trouble; and she assured



<P>him "that she was not at all afraid of the trouble;



<P>indeed, she could not imagine there would be any."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris was ready with her suggestions as to the rooms he



<P>would think fittest to be used, but found it all prearranged;



<P>and when she would have conjectured and hinted about



<P>the day, it appeared that the day was settled too.



<P>Sir Thomas had been amusing himself with shaping a very



<P>complete outline of the business; and as soon as she



<P>would listen quietly, could read his list of the families



<P>to be invited, from whom he calculated, with all necessary



<P>allowance for the shortness of the notice, to collect



<P>young people enough to form twelve or fourteen couple:



<P>and could detail the considerations which had induced



<P>him to fix on the 22nd as the most eligible day.



<P>William was required to be at Portsmouth on the 24th;



<P>the 22nd would therefore be the last day of his visit;



<P>but where the days were so few it would be unwise to fix



<P>on any earlier.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris was obliged to be satisfied



<P>with thinking just the same, and with having been on the



<P>point of proposing the 22nd herself, as by far the best day



<P>for the purpose.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The ball was now a settled thing, and before the evening



<P>a proclaimed thing to all whom it concerned.&nbsp; Invitations were



<P>sent with despatch, and many a young lady went to bed that



<P>night with her head full of happy cares as well as Fanny.



<P>To her the cares were sometimes almost beyond the happiness;



<P>for young and inexperienced, with small means of choice



<P>and no confidence in her own taste, the "how she



<P>should be dressed" was a point of painful solicitude;



<P>and the almost solitary ornament in her possession,



<P>a very pretty amber cross which William had brought



<P>her from Sicily, was the greatest distress of all,



<P>for she had nothing but a bit of ribbon to fasten it to;



<P>and though she had worn it in that manner once, would it



<P>be allowable at such a time in the midst of all the rich



<P>ornaments which she supposed all the other young ladies



<P>would appear in?&nbsp; And yet not to wear it!&nbsp; William had



<P>wanted to buy her a gold chain too, but the purchase had



<P>been beyond his means, and therefore not to wear the cross



<P>might be mortifying him.&nbsp; These were anxious considerations;



<P>enough to sober her spirits even under the prospect



<P>of a ball given principally for her gratification.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The preparations meanwhile went on, and Lady Bertram continued



<P>to sit on her sofa without any inconvenience from them.



<P>She had some extra visits from the housekeeper, and her



<P>maid was rather hurried in making up a new dress for her:



<P>Sir Thomas gave orders, and Mrs. Norris ran about;



<P>but all this gave _her_ no trouble, and as she had foreseen,



<P>"there was, in fact, no trouble in the business."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund was at this time particularly full of cares:



<P>his mind being deeply occupied in the consideration of two



<P>important events now at hand, which were to fix his fate



<P>in life--ordination and matrimony--events of such a serious



<P>character as to make the ball, which would be very quickly



<P>followed by one of them, appear of less moment in his



<P>eyes than in those of any other person in the house.



<P>On the 23rd he was going to a friend near Peterborough,



<P>in the same situation as himself, and they were to



<P>receive ordination in the course of the Christmas week.



<P>Half his destiny would then be determined, but the other



<P>half might not be so very smoothly wooed.&nbsp; His duties would



<P>be established, but the wife who was to share, and animate,



<P>and reward those duties, might yet be unattainable.



<P>He knew his own mind, but he was not always perfectly assured



<P>of knowing Miss Crawford's. There were points on which they



<P>did not quite agree; there were moments in which she did



<P>not seem propitious; and though trusting altogether to



<P>her affection, so far as to be resolved--almost resolved--



<P>on bringing it to a decision within a very short time,



<P>as soon as the variety of business before him were arranged,



<P>and he knew what he had to offer her, he had many



<P>anxious feelings, many doubting hours as to the result.



<P>His conviction of her regard for him was sometimes very strong;



<P>he could look back on a long course of encouragement,



<P>and she was as perfect in disinterested attachment as



<P>in everything else.&nbsp; But at other times doubt and alarm



<P>intermingled with his hopes; and when he thought of her



<P>acknowledged disinclination for privacy and retirement,



<P>her decided preference of a London life, what could he expect



<P>but a determined rejection? unless it were an acceptance



<P>even more to be deprecated, demanding such sacrifices



<P>of situation and employment on his side as conscience



<P>must forbid.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The issue of all depended on one question.&nbsp; Did she



<P>love him well enough to forego what had used to be



<P>essential points?&nbsp; Did she love him well enough to make



<P>them no longer essential?&nbsp; And this question, which he



<P>was continually repeating to himself, though oftenest



<P>answered with a "Yes," had sometimes its "No."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Crawford was soon to leave Mansfield, and on this



<P>circumstance the "no" and the "yes" had been very recently



<P>in alternation.&nbsp; He had seen her eyes sparkle as she spoke



<P>of the dear friend's letter, which claimed a long visit from



<P>her in London, and of the kindness of Henry, in engaging



<P>to remain where he was till January, that he might convey



<P>her thither; he had heard her speak of the pleasure of such



<P>a journey with an animation which had "no" in every tone.



<P>But this had occurred on the first day of its being settled,



<P>within the first hour of the burst of such enjoyment,



<P>when nothing but the friends she was to visit was before her.



<P>He had since heard her express herself differently,



<P>with other feelings, more chequered feelings:&nbsp; he had heard



<P>her tell Mrs. Grant that she should leave her with regret;



<P>that she began to believe neither the friends nor



<P>the pleasures she was going to were worth those she



<P>left behind; and that though she felt she must go,



<P>and knew she should enjoy herself when once away, she was



<P>already looking forward to being at Mansfield again.



<P>Was there not a "yes" in all this?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With such matters to ponder over, and arrange, and re-arrange,



<P>Edmund could not, on his own account, think very much



<P>of the evening which the rest of the family were looking



<P>forward to with a more equal degree of strong interest.



<P>Independent of his two cousins' enjoyment in it,



<P>the evening was to him of no higher value than any



<P>other appointed meeting of the two families might be.



<P>In every meeting there was a hope of receiving farther



<P>confirmation of Miss Crawford's attachment; but the whirl



<P>of a ballroom, perhaps, was not particularly favourable



<P>to the excitement or expression of serious feelings.



<P>To engage her early for the two first dances was all the



<P>command of individual happiness which he felt in his power,



<P>and the only preparation for the ball which he could



<P>enter into, in spite of all that was passing around him



<P>on the subject, from morning till night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thursday was the day of the ball; and on Wednesday



<P>morning Fanny, still unable to satisfy herself as to what



<P>she ought to wear, determined to seek the counsel of the



<P>more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant and her sister,



<P>whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her blameless;



<P>and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton,



<P>and she had reason to think Mr. Crawford likewise out,



<P>she walked down to the Parsonage without much fear of wanting



<P>an opportunity for private discussion; and the privacy of



<P>such a discussion was a most important part of it to Fanny,



<P>being more than half-ashamed of her own solicitude.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage,



<P>just setting out to call on her, and as it seemed to her



<P>that her friend, though obliged to insist on turning back,



<P>was unwilling to lose her walk, she explained her business



<P>at once, and observed, that if she would be so kind



<P>as to give her opinion, it might be all talked over as



<P>well without doors as within.&nbsp; Miss Crawford appeared



<P>gratified by the application, and after a moment's thought,



<P>urged Fanny's returning with her in a much more cordial



<P>manner than before, and proposed their going up into



<P>her room, where they might have a comfortable coze,



<P>without disturbing Dr. and Mrs. Grant, who were together



<P>in the drawing-room. It was just the plan to suit Fanny;



<P>and with a great deal of gratitude on her side for such ready



<P>and kind attention, they proceeded indoors, and upstairs,



<P>and were soon deep in the interesting subject.&nbsp; Miss Crawford,



<P>pleased with the appeal, gave her all her best judgment



<P>and taste, made everything easy by her suggestions,



<P>and tried to make everything agreeable by her encouragement.



<P>The dress being settled in all its grander parts--



<P>"But what shall you have by way of necklace?" said Miss



<P>Crawford.&nbsp; "Shall not you wear your brother's cross?"



<P>And as she spoke she was undoing a small parcel,



<P>which Fanny had observed in her hand when they met.



<P>Fanny acknowledged her wishes and doubts on this point:



<P>she did not know how either to wear the cross, or to



<P>refrain from wearing it.&nbsp; She was answered by having



<P>a small trinket-box placed before her, and being requested



<P>to chuse from among several gold chains and necklaces.



<P>Such had been the parcel with which Miss Crawford



<P>was provided, and such the object of her intended visit:



<P>and in the kindest manner she now urged Fanny's taking one



<P>for the cross and to keep for her sake, saying everything



<P>she could think of to obviate the scruples which were



<P>making Fanny start back at first with a look of horror at



<P>the proposal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You see what a collection I have," said she; "more by half



<P>than I ever use or think of.&nbsp; I do not offer them as new.



<P>I offer nothing but an old necklace.&nbsp; You must forgive



<P>the liberty, and oblige me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny still resisted, and from her heart.&nbsp; The gift was



<P>too valuable.&nbsp; But Miss Crawford persevered, and argued



<P>the case with so much affectionate earnestness through



<P>all the heads of William and the cross, and the ball,



<P>and herself, as to be finally successful.&nbsp; Fanny found



<P>herself obliged to yield, that she might not be accused



<P>of pride or indifference, or some other littleness;



<P>and having with modest reluctance given her consent,



<P>proceeded to make the selection.&nbsp; She looked and looked,



<P>longing to know which might be least valuable; and was



<P>determined in her choice at last, by fancying there was



<P>one necklace more frequently placed before her eyes than



<P>the rest.&nbsp; It was of gold, prettily worked; and though Fanny



<P>would have preferred a longer and a plainer chain as more



<P>adapted for her purpose, she hoped, in fixing on this,



<P>to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to keep.



<P>Miss Crawford smiled her perfect approbation; and hastened



<P>to complete the gift by putting the necklace round her,



<P>and making her see how well it looked.&nbsp; Fanny had not a



<P>word to say against its becomingness, and, excepting what



<P>remained of her scruples, was exceedingly pleased with an



<P>acquisition so very apropos.&nbsp; She would rather, perhaps,



<P>have been obliged to some other person.&nbsp; But this was



<P>an unworthy feeling.&nbsp; Miss Crawford had anticipated her



<P>wants with a kindness which proved her a real friend.



<P>"When I wear this necklace I shall always think of you,"



<P>said she, "and feel how very kind you were."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You must think of somebody else too, when you wear



<P>that necklace," replied Miss Crawford.&nbsp; "You must think



<P>of Henry, for it was his choice in the first place.



<P>He gave it to me, and with the necklace I make over



<P>to you all the duty of remembering the original giver.



<P>It is to be a family remembrancer.&nbsp; The sister is not to be



<P>in your mind without bringing the brother too."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, in great astonishment and confusion, would have



<P>returned the present instantly.&nbsp; To take what had



<P>been the gift of another person, of a brother too,



<P>impossible! it must not be! and with an eagerness and



<P>embarrassment quite diverting to her companion, she laid



<P>down the necklace again on its cotton, and seemed resolved



<P>either to take another or none at all.&nbsp; Miss Crawford



<P>thought she had never seen a prettier consciousness.



<P>"My dear child," said she, laughing, "what are you afraid of?



<P>Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine,



<P>and fancy you did not come honestly by it? or are you



<P>imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing



<P>round your lovely throat an ornament which his money



<P>purchased three years ago, before he knew there was such



<P>a throat in the world? or perhaps"--looking archly--



<P>"you suspect a confederacy between us, and that what



<P>I am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With the deepest blushes Fanny protested against such



<P>a thought.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, then," replied Miss Crawford more seriously,



<P>but without at all believing her, "to convince me that you



<P>suspect no trick, and are as unsuspicious of compliment



<P>as I have always found you, take the necklace and say



<P>no more about it.&nbsp; Its being a gift of my brother's need



<P>not make the smallest difference in your accepting it,



<P>as I assure you it makes none in my willingness to part



<P>with it.&nbsp; He is always giving me something or other.



<P>I have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite



<P>impossible for me to value or for him to remember half.



<P>And as for this necklace, I do not suppose I have worn it



<P>six times:&nbsp; it is very pretty, but I never think of it;



<P>and though you would be most heartily welcome to any



<P>other in my trinket-box, you have happened to fix on



<P>the very one which, if I have a choice, I would rather



<P>part with and see in your possession than any other.



<P>Say no more against it, I entreat you.&nbsp; Such a trifle is



<P>not worth half so many words."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny dared not make any farther opposition; and with



<P>renewed but less happy thanks accepted the necklace again,



<P>for there was an expression in Miss Crawford's eyes



<P>which she could not be satisfied with.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was impossible for her to be insensible of Mr. Crawford's



<P>change of manners.&nbsp; She had long seen it.&nbsp; He evidently



<P>tried to please her:&nbsp; he was gallant, he was attentive,



<P>he was something like what he had been to her cousins:



<P>he wanted, she supposed, to cheat her of her tranquillity



<P>as he had cheated them; and whether he might not have some



<P>concern in this necklace--she could not be convinced that



<P>he had not, for Miss Crawford, complaisant as a sister,



<P>was careless as a woman and a friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Reflecting and doubting, and feeling that the possession



<P>of what she had so much wished for did not bring much



<P>satisfaction, she now walked home again, with a change rather



<P>than a diminution of cares since her treading that path before.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>On reaching home Fanny went immediately upstairs to



<P>deposit this unexpected acquisition, this doubtful good



<P>of a necklace, in some favourite box in the East room,



<P>which held all her smaller treasures; but on opening



<P>the door, what was her surprise to find her cousin Edmund



<P>there writing at the table!&nbsp; Such a sight having never



<P>occurred before, was almost as wonderful as it was welcome.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Fanny," said he directly, leaving his seat and his pen,



<P>and meeting her with something in his hand, "I beg



<P>your pardon for being here.&nbsp; I came to look for you,



<P>and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in,



<P>was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand.



<P>You will find the beginning of a note to yourself;



<P>but I can now speak my business, which is merely to beg



<P>your acceptance of this little trifle--a chain for



<P>William's cross.&nbsp; You ought to have had it a week ago,



<P>but there has been a delay from my brother's not



<P>being in town by several days so soon as I expected;



<P>and I have only just now received it at Northampton.



<P>I hope you will like the chain itself, Fanny.&nbsp; I endeavoured



<P>to consult the simplicity of your taste; but, at any rate,



<P>I know you will be kind to my intentions, and consider it,



<P>as it really is, a token of the love of one of your



<P>oldest friends."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And so saying, he was hurrying away, before Fanny,



<P>overpowered by a thousand feelings of pain and pleasure,



<P>could attempt to speak; but quickened by one sovereign wish,



<P>she then called out, "Oh! cousin, stop a moment,



<P>pray stop!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He turned back.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot attempt to thank you," she continued, in a



<P>very agitated manner; "thanks are out of the question.



<P>I feel much more than I can possibly express.



<P>Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond--



<P>"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If that is all you have to say, Fanny" smiling and turning



<P>away again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no, it is not.&nbsp; I want to consult you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almost unconsciously she had now undone the parcel he



<P>had just put into her hand, and seeing before her,



<P>in all the niceness of jewellers' packing, a plain



<P>gold chain, perfectly simple and neat, she could not help



<P>bursting forth again, "Oh, this is beautiful indeed!



<P>This is the very thing, precisely what I wished for!



<P>This is the only ornament I have ever had a desire to possess.



<P>It will exactly suit my cross.&nbsp; They must and shall be



<P>worn together.&nbsp; It comes, too, in such an acceptable moment.



<P>Oh, cousin, you do not know how acceptable it is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Fanny, you feel these things a great deal too much.



<P>I am most happy that you like the chain, and that it



<P>should be here in time for to-morrow; but your thanks are



<P>far beyond the occasion.&nbsp; Believe me, I have no pleasure



<P>in the world superior to that of contributing to yours.



<P>No, I can safely say, I have no pleasure so complete,



<P>so unalloyed.&nbsp; It is without a drawback."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Upon such expressions of affection Fanny could have



<P>lived an hour without saying another word; but Edmund,



<P>after waiting a moment, obliged her to bring down her



<P>mind from its heavenly flight by saying, "But what is it



<P>that you want to consult me about?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was about the necklace, which she was now most earnestly



<P>longing to return, and hoped to obtain his approbation



<P>of her doing.&nbsp; She gave the history of her recent visit,



<P>and now her raptures might well be over; for Edmund was so



<P>struck with the circumstance, so delighted with what Miss



<P>Crawford had done, so gratified by such a coincidence



<P>of conduct between them, that Fanny could not but admit



<P>the superior power of one pleasure over his own mind,



<P>though it might have its drawback.&nbsp; It was some time



<P>before she could get his attention to her plan, or any



<P>answer to her demand of his opinion:&nbsp; he was in a reverie



<P>of fond reflection, uttering only now and then a few



<P>half-sentences of praise; but when he did awake and understand,



<P>he was very decided in opposing what she wished.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Return the necklace!&nbsp; No, my dear Fanny, upon no account.



<P>It would be mortifying her severely.&nbsp; There can hardly



<P>be a more unpleasant sensation than the having anything



<P>returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable



<P>hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend.



<P>Why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself



<P>so deserving of?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If it had been given to me in the first instance,"



<P>said Fanny, "I should not have thought of returning it;



<P>but being her brother's present, is not it fair to suppose



<P>that she would rather not part with it, when it is



<P>not wanted?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She must not suppose it not wanted, not acceptable,



<P>at least:&nbsp; and its having been originally her brother's



<P>gift makes no difference; for as she was not prevented



<P>from offering, nor you from taking it on that account,



<P>it ought not to prevent you from keeping it.&nbsp; No doubt it



<P>is handsomer than mine, and fitter for a ballroom."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, it is not handsomer, not at all handsomer



<P>in its way, and, for my purpose, not half so fit.



<P>The chain will agree with William's cross beyond



<P>all comparison better than the necklace."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"For one night, Fanny, for only one night, if it _be_



<P>a sacrifice; I am sure you will, upon consideration,



<P>make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been



<P>so studious of your comfort.&nbsp; Miss Crawford's attentions



<P>to you have been--not more than you were justly entitled to--



<P>I am the last person to think that _could_ _be_,



<P>but they have been invariable; and to be returning them



<P>with what must have something the _air_ of ingratitude,



<P>though I know it could never have the _meaning_, is not



<P>in your nature, I am sure.&nbsp; Wear the necklace, as you



<P>are engaged to do, to-morrow evening, and let the chain,



<P>which was not ordered with any reference to the ball,



<P>be kept for commoner occasions.&nbsp; This is my advice.



<P>I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose



<P>intimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure,



<P>and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance



<P>in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few



<P>slight differences, resulting principally from situation,



<P>no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship.&nbsp; I would



<P>not have the shadow of a coolness arise," he repeated,



<P>his voice sinking a little, "between the two dearest objects



<P>I have on earth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was gone as he spoke; and Fanny remained to tranquillise



<P>herself as she could.&nbsp; She was one of his two dearest--



<P>that must support her.&nbsp; But the other:&nbsp; the first!



<P>She had never heard him speak so openly before, and though



<P>it told her no more than what she had long perceived,



<P>it was a stab, for it told of his own convictions and views.



<P>They were decided.&nbsp; He would marry Miss Crawford.



<P>It was a stab, in spite of every long-standing expectation;



<P>and she was obliged to repeat again and again, that she



<P>was one of his two dearest, before the words gave



<P>her any sensation.&nbsp; Could she believe Miss Crawford to



<P>deserve him, it would be--oh, how different would it be--



<P>how far more tolerable!&nbsp; But he was deceived in her:



<P>he gave her merits which she had not; her faults were



<P>what they had ever been, but he saw them no longer.



<P>Till she had shed many tears over this deception,



<P>Fanny could not subdue her agitation; and the dejection



<P>which followed could only be relieved by the influence of



<P>fervent prayers for his happiness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was her intention, as she felt it to be her duty,



<P>to try to overcome all that was excessive, all that



<P>bordered on selfishness, in her affection for Edmund.



<P>To call or to fancy it a loss, a disappointment, would be



<P>a presumption for which she had not words strong enough to



<P>satisfy her own humility.&nbsp; To think of him as Miss Crawford



<P>might be justified in thinking, would in her be insanity.



<P>To her he could be nothing under any circumstances;



<P>nothing dearer than a friend.&nbsp; Why did such an idea occur



<P>to her even enough to be reprobated and forbidden?&nbsp; It ought



<P>not to have touched on the confines of her imagination.



<P>She would endeavour to be rational, and to deserve



<P>the right of judging of Miss Crawford's character,



<P>and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a sound



<P>intellect and an honest heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had all the heroism of principle, and was determined



<P>to do her duty; but having also many of the feelings of youth



<P>and nature, let her not be much wondered at, if, after making



<P>all these good resolutions on the side of self-government,



<P>she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund had begun



<P>writing to her, as a treasure beyond all her hopes,



<P>and reading with the tenderest emotion these words,



<P>"My very dear Fanny, you must do me the favour to accept"



<P>locked it up with the chain, as the dearest part of the gift.



<P>It was the only thing approaching to a letter which she



<P>had ever received from him; she might never receive another;



<P>it was impossible that she ever should receive another



<P>so perfectly gratifying in the occasion and the style.



<P>Two lines more prized had never fallen from the pen



<P>of the most distinguished author--never more completely



<P>blessed the researches of the fondest biographer.



<P>The enthusiasm of a woman's love is even beyond



<P>the biographer's. To her, the handwriting itself,



<P>independent of anything it may convey, is a blessedness.



<P>Never were such characters cut by any other human being



<P>as Edmund's commonest handwriting gave!&nbsp; This specimen,



<P>written in haste as it was, had not a fault; and there



<P>was a felicity in the flow of the first four words,



<P>in the arrangement of "My very dear Fanny," which she



<P>could have looked at for ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Having regulated her thoughts and comforted her feelings



<P>by this happy mixture of reason and weakness, she was able



<P>in due time to go down and resume her usual employments



<P>near her aunt Bertram, and pay her the usual observances



<P>without any apparent want of spirits.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thursday, predestined to hope and enjoyment, came; and opened



<P>with more kindness to Fanny than such self-willed,



<P>unmanageable days often volunteer, for soon after breakfast



<P>a very friendly note was brought from Mr. Crawford



<P>to William, stating that as he found himself obliged



<P>to go to London on the morrow for a few days, he could



<P>not help trying to procure a companion; and therefore



<P>hoped that if William could make up his mind to leave



<P>Mansfield half a day earlier than had been proposed,



<P>he would accept a place in his carriage.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford meant



<P>to be in town by his uncle's accustomary late dinner-hour,



<P>and William was invited to dine with him at the Admiral's.



<P>The proposal was a very pleasant one to William himself,



<P>who enjoyed the idea of travelling post with four horses,



<P>and such a good-humoured, agreeable friend; and, in likening



<P>it to going up with despatches, was saying at once everything



<P>in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination



<P>could suggest; and Fanny, from a different motive,



<P>was exceedingly pleased; for the original plan was that



<P>William should go up by the mail from Northampton the



<P>following night, which would not have allowed him an hour's



<P>rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach;



<P>and though this offer of Mr. Crawford's would rob her



<P>of many hours of his company, she was too happy in having



<P>William spared from the fatigue of such a journey,



<P>to think of anything else.&nbsp; Sir Thomas approved of it



<P>for another reason.&nbsp; His nephew's introduction to Admiral



<P>Crawford might be of service.&nbsp; The Admiral, he believed,



<P>had interest.&nbsp; Upon the whole, it was a very joyous note.



<P>Fanny's spirits lived on it half the morning, deriving



<P>some accession of pleasure from its writer being himself to go



<P>away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As for the ball, so near at hand, she had too many



<P>agitations and fears to have half the enjoyment in



<P>anticipation which she ought to have had, or must have



<P>been supposed to have by the many young ladies looking



<P>forward to the same event in situations more at ease,



<P>but under circumstances of less novelty, less interest,



<P>less peculiar gratification, than would be attributed



<P>to her.&nbsp; Miss Price, known only by name to half the



<P>people invited, was now to make her first appearance,



<P>and must be regarded as the queen of the evening.



<P>Who could be happier than Miss Price?&nbsp; But Miss Price



<P>had not been brought up to the trade of _coming_ _out_;



<P>and had she known in what light this ball was, in general,



<P>considered respecting her, it would very much have lessened



<P>her comfort by increasing the fears she already had of doing



<P>wrong and being looked at.&nbsp; To dance without much observation



<P>or any extraordinary fatigue, to have strength and partners



<P>for about half the evening, to dance a little with Edmund,



<P>and not a great deal with Mr. Crawford, to see William



<P>enjoy himself, and be able to keep away from her aunt Norris,



<P>was the height of her ambition, and seemed to comprehend



<P>her greatest possibility of happiness.&nbsp; As these were



<P>the best of her hopes, they could not always prevail;



<P>and in the course of a long morning, spent principally



<P>with her two aunts, she was often under the influence



<P>of much less sanguine views.&nbsp; William, determined to



<P>make this last day a day of thorough enjoyment,



<P>was out snipe-shooting; Edmund, she had too much reason



<P>to suppose, was at the Parsonage; and left alone to bear



<P>the worrying of Mrs. Norris, who was cross because the



<P>housekeeper would have her own way with the supper,



<P>and whom _she_ could not avoid though the housekeeper might,



<P>Fanny was worn down at last to think everything an evil



<P>belonging to the ball, and when sent off with a parting worry



<P>to dress, moved as languidly towards her own room, and felt



<P>as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no share in



<P>it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday;



<P>it had been about the same hour that she had returned



<P>from the Parsonage, and found Edmund in the East room.



<P>"Suppose I were to find him there again to-day!" said she



<P>to herself, in a fond indulgence of fancy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Fanny," said a voice at that moment near her.



<P>Starting and looking up, she saw, across the lobby she



<P>had just reached, Edmund himself, standing at the head



<P>of a different staircase.&nbsp; He came towards her.&nbsp; "You look



<P>tired and fagged, Fanny.&nbsp; You have been walking too far."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I have not been out at all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then you have had fatigues within doors, which are worse.



<P>You had better have gone out."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny, not liking to complain, found it easiest to make



<P>no answer; and though he looked at her with his usual kindness,



<P>she believed he had soon ceased to think of her countenance.



<P>He did not appear in spirits:&nbsp; something unconnected with



<P>her was probably amiss.&nbsp; They proceeded upstairs together,



<P>their rooms being on the same floor above.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I come from Dr. Grant's," said Edmund presently.



<P>"You may guess my errand there, Fanny."&nbsp; And he looked



<P>so conscious, that Fanny could think but of one errand,



<P>which turned her too sick for speech.&nbsp; "I wished to



<P>engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances," was the



<P>explanation that followed, and brought Fanny to life again,



<P>enabling her, as she found she was expected to speak,



<P>to utter something like an inquiry as to the result.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," he answered, "she is engaged to me; but" (with a smile



<P>that did not sit easy) "she says it is to be the last time



<P>that she ever will dance with me.&nbsp; She is not serious.



<P>I think, I hope, I am sure she is not serious; but I would



<P>rather not hear it.&nbsp; She never has danced with a clergyman,



<P>she says, and she never _will_.&nbsp; For my own sake, I could



<P>wish there had been no ball just at--I mean not this



<P>very week, this very day; to-morrow I leave home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny struggled for speech, and said, "I am very sorry



<P>that anything has occurred to distress you.&nbsp; This ought



<P>to be a day of pleasure.&nbsp; My uncle meant it so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh yes, yes! and it will be a day of pleasure.



<P>It will all end right.&nbsp; I am only vexed for a moment.



<P>In fact, it is not that I consider the ball as ill-timed;



<P>what does it signify?&nbsp; But, Fanny," stopping her,



<P>by taking her hand, and speaking low and seriously,



<P>"you know what all this means.&nbsp; You see how it is;



<P>and could tell me, perhaps better than I could tell you,



<P>how and why I am vexed.&nbsp; Let me talk to you a little.



<P>You are a kind, kind listener.&nbsp; I have been pained



<P>by her manner this morning, and cannot get the better



<P>of it.&nbsp; I know her disposition to be as sweet and



<P>faultless as your own, but the influence of her former



<P>companions makes her seem--gives to her conversation,



<P>to her professed opinions, sometimes a tinge of wrong.



<P>She does not _think_ evil, but she speaks it, speaks it



<P>in playfulness; and though I know it to be playfulness,



<P>it grieves me to the soul."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The effect of education," said Fanny gently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edmund could not but agree to it.&nbsp; "Yes, that uncle and aunt!



<P>They have injured the finest mind; for sometimes,



<P>Fanny, I own to you, it does appear more than manner:



<P>it appears as if the mind itself was tainted."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment,



<P>and therefore, after a moment's consideration, said, "If you



<P>only want me as a listener, cousin, I will be as useful



<P>as I can; but I am not qualified for an adviser.



<P>Do not ask advice of _me_.&nbsp; I am not competent."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are right, Fanny, to protest against such an office,



<P>but you need not be afraid.&nbsp; It is a subject on which I



<P>should never ask advice; it is the sort of subject on



<P>which it had better never be asked; and few, I imagine,



<P>do ask it, but when they want to be influenced against



<P>their conscience.&nbsp; I only want to talk to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"One thing more.&nbsp; Excuse the liberty; but take care



<P>_how_ you talk to me.&nbsp; Do not tell me anything now,



<P>which hereafter you may be sorry for.&nbsp; The time may come--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The colour rushed into her cheeks as she spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dearest Fanny!" cried Edmund, pressing her hand to



<P>his lips with almost as much warmth as if it had been



<P>Miss Crawford's, "you are all considerate thought!



<P>But it is unnecessary here.&nbsp; The time will never come.



<P>No such time as you allude to will ever come.&nbsp; I begin to



<P>think it most improbable:&nbsp; the chances grow less and less;



<P>and even if it should, there will be nothing to be



<P>remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of,



<P>for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples; and if they



<P>are removed, it must be by changes that will only raise



<P>her character the more by the recollection of the faults



<P>she once had.&nbsp; You are the only being upon earth to whom



<P>I should say what I have said; but you have always known



<P>my opinion of her; you can bear me witness, Fanny, that I



<P>have never been blinded.&nbsp; How many a time have we



<P>talked over her little errors!&nbsp; You need not fear me;



<P>I have almost given up every serious idea of her;



<P>but I must be a blockhead indeed, if, whatever befell me,



<P>I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the



<P>sincerest gratitude."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen.



<P>He had said enough to give Fanny some happier feelings



<P>than she had lately known, and with a brighter look,



<P>she answered, "Yes, cousin, I am convinced that _you_



<P>would be incapable of anything else, though perhaps some



<P>might not.&nbsp; I cannot be afraid of hearing anything you



<P>wish to say.&nbsp; Do not check yourself.&nbsp; Tell me whatever



<P>you like."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were now on the second floor, and the appearance



<P>of a housemaid prevented any farther conversation.



<P>For Fanny's present comfort it was concluded, perhaps,



<P>at the happiest moment:&nbsp; had he been able to talk another



<P>five minutes, there is no saying that he might not have talked



<P>away all Miss Crawford's faults and his own despondence.



<P>But as it was, they parted with looks on his side of



<P>grateful affection, and with some very precious sensations



<P>on hers.&nbsp; She had felt nothing like it for hours.



<P>Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford's note to William had



<P>worn away, she had been in a state absolutely the reverse;



<P>there had been no comfort around, no hope within her.



<P>Now everything was smiling.&nbsp; William's good fortune



<P>returned again upon her mind, and seemed of greater



<P>value than at first.&nbsp; The ball, too--such an evening



<P>of pleasure before her!&nbsp; It was now a real animation;



<P>and she began to dress for it with much of the happy



<P>flutter which belongs to a ball.&nbsp; All went well:



<P>she did not dislike her own looks; and when she came



<P>to the necklaces again, her good fortune seemed complete,



<P>for upon trial the one given her by Miss Crawford would



<P>by no means go through the ring of the cross.&nbsp; She had,



<P>to oblige Edmund, resolved to wear it; but it was too



<P>large for the purpose.&nbsp; His, therefore, must be worn;



<P>and having, with delightful feelings, joined the chain



<P>and the cross--those memorials of the two most beloved



<P>of her heart, those dearest tokens so formed for each



<P>other by everything real and imaginary--and put them



<P>round her neck, and seen and felt how full of William



<P>and Edmund they were, she was able, without an effort,



<P>to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford's necklace too.



<P>She acknowledged it to be right.&nbsp; Miss Crawford had a claim;



<P>and when it was no longer to encroach on, to interfere



<P>with the stronger claims, the truer kindness of another,



<P>she could do her justice even with pleasure to herself.



<P>The necklace really looked very well; and Fanny left her



<P>room at last, comfortably satisfied with herself and all



<P>about her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her aunt Bertram had recollected her on this occasion with



<P>an unusual degree of wakefulness.&nbsp; It had really occurred



<P>to her, unprompted, that Fanny, preparing for a ball,



<P>might be glad of better help than the upper housemaid's,



<P>and when dressed herself, she actually sent her own maid



<P>to assist her; too late, of course, to be of any use.



<P>Mrs. Chapman had just reached the attic floor, when Miss



<P>Price came out of her room completely dressed, and only



<P>civilities were necessary; but Fanny felt her aunt's



<P>attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman



<P>could do themselves.

<B>CHAPTER XXXIII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The conference was neither so short nor so conclusive



<P>as the lady had designed.&nbsp; The gentleman was not



<P>so easily satisfied.&nbsp; He had all the disposition to



<P>persevere that Sir Thomas could wish him.&nbsp; He had vanity,



<P>which strongly inclined him in the first place to think



<P>she did love him, though she might not know it herself;



<P>and which, secondly, when constrained at last to admit



<P>that she did know her own present feelings, convinced him



<P>that he should be able in time to make those feelings



<P>what he wished.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was in love, very much in love; and it was a love which,



<P>operating on an active, sanguine spirit, of more warmth



<P>than delicacy, made her affection appear of greater



<P>consequence because it was withheld, and determined him



<P>to have the glory, as well as the felicity, of forcing



<P>her to love him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He would not despair:&nbsp; he would not desist.&nbsp; He had every



<P>well-grounded reason for solid attachment; he knew her



<P>to have all the worth that could justify the warmest



<P>hopes of lasting happiness with her; her conduct at this



<P>very time, by speaking the disinterestedness and delicacy



<P>of her character (qualities which he believed most rare



<P>indeed), was of a sort to heighten all his wishes,



<P>and confirm all his resolutions.&nbsp; He knew not that he had a



<P>pre-engaged heart to attack.&nbsp; Of _that_ he had no suspicion.



<P>He considered her rather as one who had never thought



<P>on the subject enough to be in danger; who had been



<P>guarded by youth, a youth of mind as lovely as of person;



<P>whose modesty had prevented her from understanding



<P>his attentions, and who was still overpowered by the



<P>suddenness of addresses so wholly unexpected, and the novelty



<P>of a situation which her fancy had never taken into account.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Must it not follow of course, that, when he was understood,



<P>he should succeed?&nbsp; He believed it fully.&nbsp; Love such as his,



<P>in a man like himself, must with perseverance secure a return,



<P>and at no great distance; and he had so much delight in



<P>the idea of obliging her to love him in a very short time,



<P>that her not loving him now was scarcely regretted.



<P>A little difficulty to be overcome was no evil to



<P>Henry Crawford.&nbsp; He rather derived spirits from it.



<P>He had been apt to gain hearts too easily.&nbsp; His situation



<P>was new and animating.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To Fanny, however, who had known too much opposition all her



<P>life to find any charm in it, all this was unintelligible.



<P>She found that he did mean to persevere; but how he could,



<P>after such language from her as she felt herself obliged



<P>to use, was not to be understood.&nbsp; She told him that she



<P>did not love him, could not love him, was sure she never



<P>should love him; that such a change was quite impossible;



<P>that the subject was most painful to her; that she must



<P>entreat him never to mention it again, to allow her to leave



<P>him at once, and let it be considered as concluded for ever.



<P>And when farther pressed, had added, that in her opinion



<P>their dispositions were so totally dissimilar as to make



<P>mutual affection incompatible; and that they were unfitted



<P>for each other by nature, education, and habit.&nbsp; All this



<P>she had said, and with the earnestness of sincerity;



<P>yet this was not enough, for he immediately denied there



<P>being anything uncongenial in their characters, or anything



<P>unfriendly in their situations; and positively declared,



<P>that he would still love, and still hope!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny knew her own meaning, but was no judge of her own manner.



<P>Her manner was incurably gentle; and she was not aware



<P>how much it concealed the sternness of her purpose.



<P>Her diffidence, gratitude, and softness made every expression



<P>of indifference seem almost an effort of self-denial;



<P>seem, at least, to be giving nearly as much pain to herself



<P>as to him.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who,



<P>as the clandestine, insidious, treacherous admirer of



<P>Maria Bertram, had been her abhorrence, whom she had hated



<P>to see or to speak to, in whom she could believe no good



<P>quality to exist, and whose power, even of being agreeable,



<P>she had barely acknowledged.&nbsp; He was now the Mr. Crawford



<P>who was addressing herself with ardent, disinterested love;



<P>whose feelings were apparently become all that was



<P>honourable and upright, whose views of happiness were all



<P>fixed on a marriage of attachment; who was pouring out



<P>his sense of her merits, describing and describing again



<P>his affection, proving as far as words could prove it,



<P>and in the language, tone, and spirit of a man of talent too,



<P>that he sought her for her gentleness and her goodness;



<P>and to complete the whole, he was now the Mr. Crawford



<P>who had procured William's promotion!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here was a change, and here were claims which could



<P>not but operate!&nbsp; She might have disdained him in all



<P>the dignity of angry virtue, in the grounds of Sotherton,



<P>or the theatre at Mansfield Park; but he approached



<P>her now with rights that demanded different treatment.



<P>She must be courteous, and she must be compassionate.



<P>She must have a sensation of being honoured, and whether



<P>thinking of herself or her brother, she must have a strong



<P>feeling of gratitude.&nbsp; The effect of the whole was a



<P>manner so pitying and agitated, and words intermingled



<P>with her refusal so expressive of obligation and concern,



<P>that to a temper of vanity and hope like Crawford's,



<P>the truth, or at least the strength of her indifference,



<P>might well be questionable; and he was not so irrational



<P>as Fanny considered him, in the professions of persevering,



<P>assiduous, and not desponding attachment which closed



<P>the interview.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was with reluctance that he suffered her to go; but there



<P>was no look of despair in parting to belie his words,



<P>or give her hopes of his being less unreasonable than he



<P>professed himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now she was angry.&nbsp; Some resentment did arise at a



<P>perseverance so selfish and ungenerous.&nbsp; Here was again



<P>a want of delicacy and regard for others which had formerly



<P>so struck and disgusted her.&nbsp; Here was again a something



<P>of the same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated before.



<P>How evidently was there a gross want of feeling and humanity



<P>where his own pleasure was concerned; and alas! how always



<P>known no principle to supply as a duty what the heart



<P>was deficient in!&nbsp; Had her own affections been as free



<P>as perhaps they ought to have been, he never could have engaged



<P>them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So thought Fanny, in good truth and sober sadness,



<P>as she sat musing over that too great indulgence and luxury



<P>of a fire upstairs:&nbsp; wondering at the past and present;



<P>wondering at what was yet to come, and in a nervous



<P>agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion



<P>of her being never under any circumstances able to love



<P>Mr. Crawford, and the felicity of having a fire to sit



<P>over and think of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas was obliged, or obliged himself, to wait till



<P>the morrow for a knowledge of what had passed between



<P>the young people.&nbsp; He then saw Mr. Crawford, and received



<P>his account.&nbsp; The first feeling was disappointment:



<P>he had hoped better things; he had thought that an hour's



<P>entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked



<P>so little change on a gentle-tempered girl like Fanny;



<P>but there was speedy comfort in the determined views



<P>and sanguine perseverance of the lover; and when seeing



<P>such confidence of success in the principal, Sir Thomas



<P>was soon able to depend on it himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nothing was omitted, on his side, of civility, compliment,



<P>or kindness, that might assist the plan.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford's



<P>steadiness was honoured, and Fanny was praised, and the



<P>connexion was still the most desirable in the world.



<P>At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome;



<P>he had only to consult his own judgment and feelings as



<P>to the frequency of his visits, at present or in future.



<P>In all his niece's family and friends, there could be



<P>but one opinion, one wish on the subject; the influence



<P>of all who loved her must incline one way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Everything was said that could encourage, every encouragement



<P>received with grateful joy, and the gentlemen parted



<P>the best of friends.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Satisfied that the cause was now on a footing the most



<P>proper and hopeful, Sir Thomas resolved to abstain



<P>from all farther importunity with his niece, and to



<P>shew no open interference.&nbsp; Upon her disposition he



<P>believed kindness might be the best way of working.



<P>Entreaty should be from one quarter only.&nbsp; The forbearance



<P>of her family on a point, respecting which she could



<P>be in no doubt of their wishes, might be their surest



<P>means of forwarding it.&nbsp; Accordingly, on this principle,



<P>Sir Thomas took the first opportunity of saying to her,



<P>with a mild gravity, intended to be overcoming,



<P>"Well, Fanny, I have seen Mr. Crawford again, and learn



<P>from him exactly how matters stand between you.&nbsp; He is



<P>a most extraordinary young man, and whatever be the event,



<P>you must feel that you have created an attachment of no



<P>common character; though, young as you are, and little



<P>acquainted with the transient, varying, unsteady nature



<P>of love, as it generally exists, you cannot be struck



<P>as I am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance



<P>of this sort against discouragement.&nbsp; With him it is



<P>entirely a matter of feeling:&nbsp; he claims no merit in it;



<P>perhaps is entitled to none.&nbsp; Yet, having chosen so well,



<P>his constancy has a respectable stamp.&nbsp; Had his choice



<P>been less unexceptionable, I should have condemned



<P>his persevering."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed, sir," said Fanny, "I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford



<P>should continue to know that it is paying me a very



<P>great compliment, and I feel most undeservedly honoured;



<P>but I am so perfectly convinced, and I have told him so,



<P>that it never will be in my power--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear," interrupted Sir Thomas, "there is no



<P>occasion for this.&nbsp; Your feelings are as well known



<P>to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you.



<P>There is nothing more to be said or done.&nbsp; From this



<P>hour the subject is never to be revived between us.



<P>You will have nothing to fear, or to be agitated about.



<P>You cannot suppose me capable of trying to persuade you



<P>to marry against your inclinations.&nbsp; Your happiness



<P>and advantage are all that I have in view, and nothing is



<P>required of you but to bear with Mr. Crawford's endeavours



<P>to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his.



<P>He proceeds at his own risk.&nbsp; You are on safe ground.



<P>I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls,



<P>as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred.



<P>You will see him with the rest of us, in the same manner,



<P>and, as much as you can, dismissing the recollection of



<P>everything unpleasant.&nbsp; He leaves Northamptonshire so soon,



<P>that even this slight sacrifice cannot be often demanded.



<P>The future must be very uncertain.&nbsp; And now, my dear Fanny,



<P>this subject is closed between us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The promised departure was all that Fanny could think



<P>of with much satisfaction.&nbsp; Her uncle's kind expressions,



<P>however, and forbearing manner, were sensibly felt;



<P>and when she considered how much of the truth was unknown



<P>to him, she believed she had no right to wonder at the line



<P>of conduct he pursued.&nbsp; He, who had married a daughter



<P>to Mr. Rushworth:&nbsp; romantic delicacy was certainly not



<P>to be expected from him.&nbsp; She must do her duty, and trust



<P>that time might make her duty easier than it now was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could not, though only eighteen, suppose Mr. Crawford's



<P>attachment would hold out for ever; she could not



<P>but imagine that steady, unceasing discouragement from



<P>herself would put an end to it in time.&nbsp; How much time



<P>she might, in her own fancy, allot for its dominion,



<P>is another concern.&nbsp; It would not be fair to inquire



<P>into a young lady's exact estimate of her own perfections.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In spite of his intended silence, Sir Thomas found himself



<P>once more obliged to mention the subject to his niece,



<P>to prepare her briefly for its being imparted to her aunts;



<P>a measure which he would still have avoided, if possible,



<P>but which became necessary from the totally opposite



<P>feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding.



<P>He had no idea of concealment.&nbsp; It was all known at



<P>the Parsonage, where he loved to talk over the future



<P>with both his sisters, and it would be rather gratifying



<P>to him to have enlightened witnesses of the progress



<P>of his success.&nbsp; When Sir Thomas understood this, he felt



<P>the necessity of making his own wife and sister-in-law



<P>acquainted with the business without delay; though,



<P>on Fanny's account, he almost dreaded the effect of the



<P>communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself.



<P>He deprecated her mistaken but well-meaning zeal.



<P>Sir Thomas, indeed, was, by this time, not very far from



<P>classing Mrs. Norris as one of those well-meaning people



<P>who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable things.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Norris, however, relieved him.&nbsp; He pressed



<P>for the strictest forbearance and silence towards



<P>their niece; she not only promised, but did observe it.



<P>She only looked her increased ill-will. Angry she was:



<P>bitterly angry; but she was more angry with Fanny for



<P>having received such an offer than for refusing it.



<P>It was an injury and affront to Julia, who ought to have



<P>been Mr. Crawford's choice; and, independently of that,



<P>she disliked Fanny, because she had neglected her;



<P>and she would have grudged such an elevation to one whom



<P>she had been always trying to depress.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Thomas gave her more credit for discretion on the



<P>occasion than she deserved; and Fanny could have blessed



<P>her for allowing her only to see her displeasure,



<P>and not to hear it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Bertram took it differently.&nbsp; She had been a beauty,



<P>and a prosperous beauty, all her life; and beauty



<P>and wealth were all that excited her respect.&nbsp; To know



<P>Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of fortune,



<P>raised her, therefore, very much in her opinion.



<P>By convincing her that Fanny _was_ very pretty, which she



<P>had been doubting about before, and that she would be



<P>advantageously married, it made her feel a sort of credit



<P>in calling her niece.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Fanny," said she, as soon as they were alone



<P>together afterwards, and she really had known something



<P>like impatience to be alone with her, and her countenance,



<P>as she spoke, had extraordinary animation; "Well, Fanny,



<P>I have had a very agreeable surprise this morning.&nbsp; I must



<P>just speak of it _once_, I told Sir Thomas I must _once_,



<P>and then I shall have done.&nbsp; I give you joy, my dear niece."



<P>And looking at her complacently, she added, "Humph, we



<P>certainly are a handsome family!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny coloured, and doubted at first what to say;



<P>when, hoping to assail her on her vulnerable side,



<P>she presently answered--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear aunt, _you_ cannot wish me to do differently from



<P>what I have done, I am sure.&nbsp; _You_ cannot wish me to marry;



<P>for you would miss me, should not you?&nbsp; Yes, I am sure



<P>you would miss me too much for that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, my dear, I should not think of missing you,



<P>when such an offer as this comes in your way.



<P>I could do very well without you, if you were married



<P>to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford.&nbsp; And you



<P>must be aware, Fanny, that it is every young woman's



<P>duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was almost the only rule of conduct, the only piece



<P>of advice, which Fanny had ever received from her aunt



<P>in the course of eight years and a half.&nbsp; It silenced her.



<P>She felt how unprofitable contention would be.



<P>If her aunt's feelings were against her, nothing could



<P>be hoped from attacking her understanding.&nbsp; Lady Bertram



<P>was quite talkative.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will tell you what, Fanny," said she, "I am sure he



<P>fell in love with you at the ball; I am sure the mischief



<P>was done that evening.&nbsp; You did look remarkably well.



<P>Everybody said so.&nbsp; Sir Thomas said so.&nbsp; And you know



<P>you had Chapman to help you to dress.&nbsp; I am very glad



<P>I sent Chapman to you.&nbsp; I shall tell Sir Thomas that I



<P>am sure it was done that evening."&nbsp; And still pursuing



<P>the same cheerful thoughts, she soon afterwards added,



<P>"And will tell you what, Fanny, which is more than I did



<P>for Maria:&nbsp; the next time Pug has a litter you shall have



<P>a puppy."
