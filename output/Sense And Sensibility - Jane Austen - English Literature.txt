<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the particulars of this conversation were

repeated



<P>by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were,



<P>the effect on her was not entirely such as the former



<P>had hoped to see.&nbsp; Not that Marianne appeared to distrust



<P>the truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all



<P>with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither



<P>objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby,



<P>and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to



<P>be impossible.&nbsp; But though this behaviour assured Elinor



<P>that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to



<P>her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it,



<P>in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,



<P>in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking,



<P>with a kind of compassionate respect, and though she



<P>saw her spirits less violently irritated than before,



<P>she did not see her less wretched.&nbsp; Her mind did become



<P>settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.



<P>She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily



<P>than she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and



<P>desertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl,



<P>and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been



<P>on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits,



<P>that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt



<P>even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence,



<P>gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated



<P>by the most open and most frequent confession of them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To give the feelings or the language of Mrs.

Dashwood



<P>on receiving and answering Elinor's letter would be only



<P>to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt



<P>and said; of a disappointment hardly less painful than



<P>Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than Elinor's.



<P>Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,



<P>arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought;



<P>to express her anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat



<P>she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune.



<P>Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne's affliction be,



<P>when her mother could talk of fortitude! mortifying



<P>and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets,



<P>which SHE could wish her not to indulge!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the interest of her own individual

comfort,



<P>Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for



<P>Marianne to be any where, at that time, than at Barton,



<P>where every thing within her view would be bringing back



<P>the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner,



<P>by constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as



<P>she had always seen him there.&nbsp; She recommended it to



<P>her daughters, therefore, by all means not to shorten their



<P>visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which, though never



<P>exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at least



<P>five or six weeks.&nbsp; A variety of occupations, of objects,



<P>and of company, which could not be procured at Barton,



<P>would be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped,



<P>cheat Marianne, at times, into some interest beyond herself,



<P>and even into some amusement, much as the ideas of both



<P>might now be spurned by her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From all danger of seeing Willoughby again,



<P>her mother considered her to be at least equally safe



<P>in town as in the country, since his acquaintance must



<P>now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends.



<P>Design could never bring them in each other's way:



<P>negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise;



<P>and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London



<P>than even in the retirement of Barton, where it might



<P>force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham



<P>on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at



<P>first as a probable event, had brought herself to expect



<P>as a certain one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had yet another reason for wishing her

children



<P>to remain where they were; a letter from her son-in-law



<P>had told her that he and his wife were to be in town



<P>before the middle of February, and she judged it right



<P>that they should sometimes see their brother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother's

opinion,



<P>and she submitted to it therefore without opposition,



<P>though it proved perfectly different from what she wished



<P>and expected, though she felt it to be entirely wrong,



<P>formed on mistaken grounds, and that by requiring her



<P>longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only



<P>possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal



<P>sympathy of her mother, and doomed her to such society and



<P>such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment's rest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was a matter of great consolation to

her,



<P>that what brought evil to herself would bring good to



<P>her sister; and Elinor, on the other hand, suspecting that



<P>it would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely,



<P>comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer



<P>stay would therefore militate against her own happiness,



<P>it would be better for Marianne than an immediate return



<P>into Devonshire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her carefulness in guarding her sister from

ever



<P>hearing Willoughby's name mentioned, was not thrown away.



<P>Marianne, though without knowing it herself, reaped all



<P>its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor Sir John,



<P>nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.



<P>Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended



<P>towards herself, but that was impossible, and she was



<P>obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir John, could not have thought it possible.



<P>"A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well!



<P>Such a good-natured fellow!&nbsp; He did not believe there was a



<P>bolder rider in England!&nbsp; It was an unaccountable business.



<P>He wished him at the devil with all his heart.&nbsp; He would



<P>not speak another word to him, meet him where he might,



<P>for all the world!&nbsp; No, not if it were to be by the side



<P>of Barton covert, and they were kept watching for two



<P>hours together.&nbsp; Such a scoundrel of a fellow! such



<P>a deceitful dog!&nbsp; It was only the last time they met



<P>that he had offered him one of Folly's puppies! and this



<P>was the end of it!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry.



<P>"She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately,



<P>and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted



<P>with him at all.&nbsp; She wished with all her heart Combe



<P>Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify,



<P>for it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated



<P>him so much that she was resolved never to mention



<P>his name again, and she should tell everybody she saw,



<P>how good-for-nothing he was."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shewn

in procuring



<P>all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage,



<P>and communicating them to Elinor.&nbsp; She could soon tell



<P>at what coachmaker's the new carriage was building,



<P>by what painter Mr. Willoughby's portrait was drawn,



<P>and at what warehouse Miss Grey's clothes might be seen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton



<P>on the occasion was a happy relief to Elinor's spirits,



<P>oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness



<P>of the others.&nbsp; It was a great comfort to her to be sure



<P>of exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their



<P>circle of friends: a great comfort to know that there



<P>was ONE who would meet her without feeling any curiosity



<P>after particulars, or any anxiety for her sister's health.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every qualification is raised at times, by

the



<P>circumstances of the moment, to more than its real value;



<P>and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence



<P>to rate good-breeding as more indispensable to comfort



<P>than good-nature.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair



<P>about once every day, or twice, if the subject occurred



<P>very often, by saying, "It is very shocking, indeed!"



<P>and by the means of this continual though gentle vent,



<P>was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the



<P>first without the smallest emotion, but very soon



<P>to see them without recollecting a word of the matter;



<P>and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex,



<P>and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong



<P>in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend



<P>to the interest of her own assemblies, and therefore



<P>determined (though rather against the opinion of Sir John)



<P>that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance



<P>and fortune, to leave her card with her as soon as she married.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive enquiries



<P>were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood.&nbsp; He had abundantly



<P>earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her



<P>sister's disappointment, by the friendly zeal with



<P>which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always



<P>conversed with confidence.&nbsp; His chief reward for the



<P>painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present



<P>humiliations, was given in the pitying eye with which



<P>Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness



<P>of her voice whenever (though it did not often happen)



<P>she was obliged, or could oblige herself to speak to him.



<P>THESE assured him that his exertion had produced an



<P>increase of good-will towards himself, and THESE gave



<P>Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter;



<P>but Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew



<P>only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that



<P>she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself,



<P>nor commission her to make it for him, began, at the



<P>end of two days, to think that, instead of Midsummer,



<P>they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the



<P>end of a week that it would not be a match at all.



<P>The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss



<P>Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours



<P>of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour,



<P>would all be made over to HER; and Mrs. Jennings had,



<P>for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in February, within a fortnight from

the



<P>receipt of Willoughby's letter, Elinor had the painful



<P>office of informing her sister that he was married.



<P>She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed



<P>to herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony



<P>was over, as she was desirous that Marianne should not



<P>receive the first notice of it from the public papers,



<P>which she saw her eagerly examining every morning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She received the news with resolute composure;



<P>made no observation on it, and at first shed no tears;



<P>but after a short time they would burst out, and for the



<P>rest of the day, she was in a state hardly less pitiable



<P>than when she first learnt to expect the event.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were

married;



<P>and Elinor now hoped, as there could be no danger



<P>of her seeing either of them, to prevail on her sister,



<P>who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell,



<P>to go out again by degrees as she had done before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About this time the two Miss Steeles, lately

arrived



<P>at their cousin's house in Bartlett's Buildings,



<P>Holburn, presented themselves again before their more



<P>grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets;



<P>and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor only was sorry to see them.&nbsp; Their

presence



<P>always gave her pain, and she hardly knew how to make



<P>a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy



<P>in finding her STILL in town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should have been quite disappointed if I

had not



<P>found you here STILL," said she repeatedly, with a strong



<P>emphasis on the word.&nbsp; "But I always thought I SHOULD.



<P>I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile;



<P>though you TOLD me, you know, at Barton, that you should



<P>not stay above a MONTH.&nbsp; But I thought, at the time,



<P>that you would most likely change your mind when it came



<P>to the point.&nbsp; It would have been such a great pity



<P>to have went away before your brother and sister came.



<P>And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone.



<P>I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor perfectly understood her, and was forced



<P>to use all her self-command to make it appear that she



<P>did NOT.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, my dear," said Mrs. Jennings, "and how

did



<P>you travel?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not in the stage, I assure you," replied Miss

Steele,



<P>with quick exultation; "we came post all the way, and had



<P>a very smart beau to attend us.&nbsp; Dr. Davies was coming



<P>to town, and so we thought we'd join him in a post-chaise;



<P>and he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or twelve



<P>shillings more than we did."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, oh!" cried Mrs. Jennings; "very pretty,



<P>indeed! and the Doctor is a single man, I warrant you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There now," said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering,



<P>"everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor, and I



<P>cannot think why.&nbsp; My cousins say they are sure I have



<P>made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never think



<P>about him from one hour's end to another.&nbsp; 'Lord! here



<P>comes your beau, Nancy,' my cousin said t'other day,



<P>when she saw him crossing the street to the house.



<P>My beau, indeed! said I--I cannot think who you mean.



<P>The Doctor is no beau of mine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--but

it won't do--



<P>the Doctor is the man, I see."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, indeed!" replied her cousin, with affected

earnestness,



<P>"and I beg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying



<P>assurance that she certainly would NOT, and Miss Steele



<P>was made completely happy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suppose you will go and stay with your brother



<P>and sister, Miss Dashwood, when they come to town,"



<P>said Lucy, returning, after a cessation of hostile hints,



<P>to the charge.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I do not think we shall."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, yes, I dare say you will."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood

can



<P>spare you both for so long a time together!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long a time, indeed!" interposed Mrs. Jennings.



<P>"Why, their visit is but just begun!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy was silenced.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss

Dashwood,"



<P>said Miss Steele.&nbsp; "I am sorry she is not well--"



<P>for Marianne had left the room on their arrival.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very good.&nbsp; My sister will be

equally



<P>sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has



<P>been very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches,



<P>which make her unfit for company or conversation."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old



<P>friends as Lucy and me!--I think she might see US;



<P>and I am sure we would not speak a word."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal.



<P>Her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her



<P>dressing gown, and therefore not able to come to them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, if that's all," cried Miss Steele, "we

can



<P>just as well go and see HER."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor began to find this impertinence too

much for



<P>her temper; but she was saved the trouble of checking it,



<P>by Lucy's sharp reprimand, which now, as on many occasions,



<P>though it did not give much sweetness to the manners



<P>of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of



<P>the other.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not find herself in the carriage

with Mrs. Jennings,



<P>and beginning a journey to London under her protection,



<P>and as her guest, without wondering at her own situation,



<P>so short had their acquaintance with that lady been,



<P>so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition,



<P>and so many had been her objections against such a measure



<P>only a few days before! But these objections had all,



<P>with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother



<P>equally shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor,



<P>in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby's constancy,



<P>could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation



<P>which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes



<P>of Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect,



<P>how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison,



<P>and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of



<P>Marianne's situation to have the same animating object



<P>in view, the same possibility of hope.&nbsp; A short, a very



<P>short time however must now decide what Willoughby's



<P>intentions were; in all probability he was already in town.



<P>Marianne's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence



<P>on finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon



<P>gaining every new light as to his character which her



<P>own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,



<P>but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister



<P>with such zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was



<P>and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place.



<P>Should the result of her observations be unfavourable,



<P>she was determined at all events to open the eyes



<P>of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions



<P>would be of a different nature--she must then learn



<P>to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret



<P>which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were three days on their journey, and

Marianne's



<P>behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what



<P>future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings



<P>might be expected to be.&nbsp; She sat in silence almost all



<P>the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely ever



<P>voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque



<P>beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation



<P>of delight exclusively addressed to her sister.&nbsp; To atone



<P>for this conduct therefore, Elinor took immediate possession



<P>of the post of civility which she had assigned herself,



<P>behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,



<P>talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her



<P>whenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side



<P>treated them both with all possible kindness, was solicitous



<P>on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment, and only



<P>disturbed that she could not make them choose their own



<P>dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their



<P>preferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets.



<P>They reached town by three o'clock the third day, glad to



<P>be released, after such a journey, from the confinement



<P>of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted

up,



<P>and the young ladies were immediately put in possession



<P>of a very comfortable apartment.&nbsp; It had formerly



<P>been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece still hung



<P>a landscape in coloured silks of her performance,



<P>in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school



<P>in town to some effect.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As dinner was not to be ready in less than

two



<P>hours from their arrival, Elinor determined to employ



<P>the interval in writing to her mother, and sat down for



<P>that purpose.&nbsp; In a few moments Marianne did the same.



<P>"I am writing home, Marianne," said Elinor; "had not you



<P>better defer your letter for a day or two?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am NOT going to write to my mother,"



<P>replied Marianne, hastily, and as if wishing to avoid



<P>any farther inquiry.&nbsp; Elinor said no more; it immediately



<P>struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby;



<P>and the conclusion which as instantly followed was,



<P>that, however mysteriously they might wish to conduct



<P>the affair, they must be engaged.&nbsp; This conviction,



<P>though not entirely satisfactory, gave her pleasure,



<P>and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.



<P>Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes;



<P>in length it could be no more than a note; it was then



<P>folded up, sealed, and directed with eager rapidity.



<P>Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in



<P>the direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne,



<P>ringing the bell, requested the footman who answered it



<P>to get that letter conveyed for her to the two-penny post.



<P>This decided the matter at once.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her spirits still continued very high; but

there



<P>was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much



<P>pleasure to her sister, and this agitation increased as



<P>the evening drew on.&nbsp; She could scarcely eat any dinner,



<P>and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room,



<P>seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that

Mrs. Jennings,



<P>by being much engaged in her own room, could see little



<P>of what was passing.&nbsp; The tea things were brought in,



<P>and already had Marianne been disappointed more than once



<P>by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly



<P>heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house,



<P>Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach,



<P>and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door.



<P>Every thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds;



<P>she opened the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs,



<P>and after listening half a minute, returned into the room



<P>in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard



<P>him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her



<P>feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming,



<P>"Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!" and seemed



<P>almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when Colonel



<P>Brandon appeared.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness,



<P>and she immediately left the room.&nbsp; Elinor was disappointed too;



<P>but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured



<P>his welcome with her; and she felt particularly hurt that



<P>a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she



<P>experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him.



<P>She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him,



<P>that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room,



<P>with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him



<P>the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is your sister ill?" said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor answered in some distress that she was,



<P>and then talked of head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues;



<P>and of every thing to which she could decently attribute



<P>her sister's behaviour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard her with the most earnest attention,



<P>but seeming to recollect himself, said no more on the subject,



<P>and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them



<P>in London, making the usual inquiries about their journey,



<P>and the friends they had left behind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this calm kind of way, with very little

interest



<P>on either side, they continued to talk, both of them out



<P>of spirits, and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere.



<P>Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were



<P>then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain



<P>by any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way



<P>of saying something, she asked if he had been in London



<P>ever since she had seen him last.&nbsp; "Yes," he replied,



<P>with some embarrassment, "almost ever since; I have been



<P>once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never



<P>been in my power to return to Barton."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, and the manner in which it was said,



<P>immediately brought back to her remembrance all the



<P>circumstances of his quitting that place, with the



<P>uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings,



<P>and she was fearful that her question had implied



<P>much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings soon came in.&nbsp; "Oh! Colonel,"

said she,



<P>with her usual noisy cheerfulness, "I am monstrous glad



<P>to see you--sorry I could not come before--beg your



<P>pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a little,



<P>and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I



<P>have been at home, and you know one has always a world



<P>of little odd things to do after one has been away for



<P>any time; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with--



<P>Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!



<P>But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should



<P>be in town today?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer's,



<P>where I have been dining."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do

at their



<P>house?&nbsp; How does Charlotte do?&nbsp; I warrant you she is a fine



<P>size by this time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am

commissioned



<P>to tell you, that you will certainly see her to-morrow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ay, to be sure, I thought as much.&nbsp; Well,

Colonel,



<P>I have brought two young ladies with me, you see--that is,



<P>you see but one of them now, but there is another somewhere.



<P>Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which you will not be



<P>sorry to hear.&nbsp; I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby



<P>will do between you about her.&nbsp; Ay, it is a fine thing



<P>to be young and handsome.&nbsp; Well! I was young once, but I



<P>never was very handsome--worse luck for me.&nbsp; However, I got



<P>a very good husband, and I don't know what the greatest



<P>beauty can do more.&nbsp; Ah! poor man! he has been dead



<P>these eight years and better.&nbsp; But Colonel, where have



<P>you been to since we parted?&nbsp; And how does your business



<P>go on?&nbsp; Come, come, let's have no secrets among friends."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He replied with his accustomary mildness to

all



<P>her inquiries, but without satisfying her in any.



<P>Elinor now began to make the tea, and Marianne was



<P>obliged to appear again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became



<P>more thoughtful and silent than he had been before,



<P>and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to stay long.



<P>No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies



<P>were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne rose the next morning with recovered

spirits



<P>and happy looks.&nbsp; The disappointment of the evening before



<P>seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen



<P>that day.&nbsp; They had not long finished their breakfast before



<P>Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, and in a few



<P>minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted



<P>to see them all, that it was hard to say whether she



<P>received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the Miss



<P>Dashwoods again.&nbsp; So surprised at their coming to town,



<P>though it was what she had rather expected all along;



<P>so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation



<P>after having declined her own, though at the same time



<P>she would never have forgiven them if they had not come!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,"



<P>said she; "What do you think he said when he heard



<P>of your coming with Mamma?&nbsp; I forget what it was now,



<P>but it was something so droll!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After an hour or two spent in what her mother

called



<P>comfortable chat, or in other words, in every variety of inquiry



<P>concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side,



<P>and in laughter without cause on Mrs. Palmer's, it was



<P>proposed by the latter that they should all accompany



<P>her to some shops where she had business that morning,



<P>to which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented,



<P>as having likewise some purchases to make themselves;



<P>and Marianne, though declining it at first was induced



<P>to go likewise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever they went, she was evidently always

on



<P>the watch.&nbsp; In Bond Street especially, where much of



<P>their business lay, her eyes were in constant inquiry;



<P>and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind was



<P>equally abstracted from every thing actually before them,



<P>from all that interested and occupied the others.



<P>Restless and dissatisfied every where, her sister could



<P>never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase,



<P>however it might equally concern them both: she received



<P>no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at



<P>home again, and could with difficulty govern her vexation



<P>at the tediousness of Mrs. Palmer, whose eye was caught



<P>by every thing pretty, expensive, or new; who was wild



<P>to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her



<P>time in rapture and indecision.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was late in the morning before they returned

home;



<P>and no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew



<P>eagerly up stairs, and when Elinor followed, she found



<P>her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance,



<P>which declared that no Willoughby had been there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Has no letter been left here for me since

we went out?"



<P>said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels.



<P>She was answered in the negative.&nbsp; "Are you quite sure



<P>of it?" she replied.&nbsp; "Are you certain that no servant,



<P>no porter has left any letter or note?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man replied that none had.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How very odd!" said she, in a low and disappointed



<P>voice, as she turned away to the window.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How odd, indeed!" repeated Elinor within herself,



<P>regarding her sister with uneasiness.&nbsp; "If she had not



<P>known him to be in town she would not have written to him,



<P>as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna;



<P>and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither



<P>come nor write!&nbsp; Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong



<P>in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young,



<P>a man so little known, to be carried on in so doubtful,



<P>so mysterious a manner!&nbsp; I long to inquire; and how will MY



<P>interference be borne."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She determined, after some consideration, that

if



<P>appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they



<P>now were, she would represent in the strongest manner



<P>to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the affair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs.

Jennings's



<P>intimate acquaintance, whom she had met and invited



<P>in the morning, dined with them.&nbsp; The former left them



<P>soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements;



<P>and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table



<P>for the others.&nbsp; Marianne was of no use on these occasions,



<P>as she would never learn the game; but though her time



<P>was therefore at her own disposal, the evening was by no



<P>means more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor,



<P>for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the



<P>pain of disappointment.&nbsp; She sometimes endeavoured for a



<P>few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside,



<P>and she returned to the more interesting employment



<P>of walking backwards and forwards across the room,



<P>pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window,



<P>in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this open weather holds much longer," said

Mrs. Jennings,



<P>when they met at breakfast the following morning,



<P>"Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week;



<P>'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day's pleasure.



<P>Poor souls!&nbsp; I always pity them when they do; they seem



<P>to take it so much to heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is true," cried Marianne, in a cheerful

voice,



<P>and walking to the window as she spoke, to examine the day.



<P>"I had not thought of that.&nbsp; This weather will keep many



<P>sportsmen in the country."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits

were



<P>restored by it.&nbsp; "It is charming weather for THEM indeed,"



<P>she continued, as she sat down to the breakfast table



<P>with a happy countenance.&nbsp; "How much they must enjoy



<P>it! But" (with a little return of anxiety) "it cannot



<P>be expected to last long.&nbsp; At this time of the year,



<P>and after such a series of rain, we shall certainly



<P>have very little more of it.&nbsp; Frosts will soon set in,



<P>and in all probability with severity.&nbsp; In another day



<P>or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last



<P>longer--nay, perhaps it may freeze tonight!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At any rate," said Elinor, wishing to prevent



<P>Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister's thoughts as clearly



<P>as she did, "I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady



<P>Middleton in town by the end of next week."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ay, my dear, I'll warrant you we do.&nbsp;

Mary always



<P>has her own way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And now," silently conjectured Elinor, "she

will



<P>write to Combe by this day's post."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if she DID, the letter was written and

sent away



<P>with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain



<P>the fact.&nbsp; Whatever the truth of it might be, and far



<P>as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it,



<P>yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could not be



<P>very uncomfortable herself.&nbsp; And Marianne was in spirits;



<P>happy in the mildness of the weather, and still happier



<P>in her expectation of a frost.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards

at



<P>the houses of Mrs. Jennings's acquaintance to inform



<P>them of her being in town; and Marianne was all the time



<P>busy in observing the direction of the wind, watching the



<P>variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you find it colder than it was in the

morning,



<P>Elinor? There seems to me a very decided difference.



<P>I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff.&nbsp; It was



<P>not so yesterday, I think.&nbsp; The clouds seem parting too,



<P>the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a



<P>clear afternoon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was alternately diverted and pained;



<P>but Marianne persevered, and saw every night in the



<P>brightness of the fire, and every morning in the appearance



<P>of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching frost.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to

be



<P>dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings's style of living, and set



<P>of acquaintance, than with her behaviour to themselves,



<P>which was invariably kind.&nbsp; Every thing in her household



<P>arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan,



<P>and excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady



<P>Middleton's regret, she had never dropped, she visited



<P>no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose



<P>the feelings of her young companions.&nbsp; Pleased to find



<P>herself more comfortably situated in that particular than



<P>she had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound



<P>for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their



<P>evening parties, which, whether at home or abroad,



<P>formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation



<P>to the house, was with them almost every day; he came



<P>to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, who often derived



<P>more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any



<P>other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time



<P>with much concern his continued regard for her sister.



<P>She feared it was a strengthening regard.&nbsp; It grieved her



<P>to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne,



<P>and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a week after their arrival, it became



<P>certain that Willoughby was also arrived.&nbsp; His card



<P>was on the table when they came in from the morning's drive.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good God!" cried Marianne, "he has been here

while



<P>we were out."&nbsp; Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his



<P>being in London, now ventured to say, "Depend upon it,



<P>he will call again tomorrow."&nbsp; But Marianne seemed



<P>hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jenning's entrance,



<P>escaped with the precious card.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This event, while it raised the spirits of

Elinor,



<P>restored to those of her sister all, and more than all,



<P>their former agitation.&nbsp; From this moment her mind was



<P>never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every hour



<P>of the day, made her unfit for any thing.&nbsp; She insisted



<P>on being left behind, the next morning, when the others



<P>went out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be

passing



<P>in Berkeley Street during their absence; but a moment's



<P>glance at her sister when they returned was enough to



<P>inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second visit there.



<P>A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For me!" cried Marianne, stepping hastily

forward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, ma'am, for my mistress."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly

up.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are expecting a letter, then?" said Elinor,



<P>unable to be longer silent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, a little--not much."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short pause.&nbsp; "You have no confidence



<P>in me, Marianne."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who

have



<P>confidence in no one!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me!" returned Elinor in some confusion; "indeed,



<P>Marianne, I have nothing to tell."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nor I," answered Marianne with energy, "our

situations



<P>then are alike.&nbsp; We have neither of us any thing to tell;



<P>you, because you do not communicate, and I, because



<P>I conceal nothing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve

in herself,



<P>which she was not at liberty to do away, knew not how,



<P>under such circumstances, to press for greater openness



<P>in Marianne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being



<P>given her, she read it aloud.&nbsp; It was from Lady Middleton,



<P>announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before,



<P>and requesting the company of her mother and cousins



<P>the following evening.&nbsp; Business on Sir John's part,



<P>and a violent cold on her own, prevented their calling



<P>in Berkeley Street.&nbsp; The invitation was accepted;



<P>but when the hour of appointment drew near, necessary as



<P>it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that they



<P>should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some



<P>difficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still



<P>she had seen nothing of Willoughby; and therefore was



<P>not more indisposed for amusement abroad, than unwilling



<P>to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor found, when the evening was over,



<P>that disposition is not materially altered by a change



<P>of abode, for although scarcely settled in town,



<P>Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty



<P>young people, and to amuse them with a ball.&nbsp; This was



<P>an affair, however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve.



<P>In the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable;



<P>but in London, where the reputation of elegance was more



<P>important and less easily attained, it was risking too much



<P>for the gratification of a few girls, to have it known that



<P>Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple,



<P>with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from

the former,



<P>whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town,



<P>as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention



<P>to his mother-in-law, and therefore never came near her,



<P>they received no mark of recognition on their entrance.



<P>He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know



<P>who they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from



<P>the other side of the room.&nbsp; Marianne gave one glance



<P>round the apartment as she entered: it was enough--HE



<P>was not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed



<P>to receive or communicate pleasure.&nbsp; After they had been



<P>assembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards



<P>the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them



<P>in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first informed



<P>of their arrival at his house, and he had himself said



<P>something very droll on hearing that they were to come.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you were both in Devonshire," said

he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you?" replied Elinor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When do you go back again?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not know." And thus ended their discourse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance



<P>in her life, as she was that evening, and never so much



<P>fatigued by the exercise.&nbsp; She complained of it



<P>as they returned to Berkeley Street.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye, aye," said Mrs. Jennings, "we know the

reason



<P>of all that very well; if a certain person who shall



<P>be nameless, had been there, you would not have been a



<P>bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very pretty



<P>of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Invited!" cried Marianne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems

Sir



<P>John met him somewhere in the street this morning."



<P>Marianne said no more, but looked exceedingly hurt.



<P>Impatient in this situation to be doing something



<P>that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved



<P>to write the next morning to her mother, and hoped



<P>by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne,



<P>to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed;



<P>and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure



<P>by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne



<P>was again writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose



<P>it to be to any other person.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings

went out by



<P>herself on business, and Elinor began her letter directly,



<P>while Marianne, too restless for employment, too anxious



<P>for conversation, walked from one window to the other,



<P>or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.



<P>Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother,



<P>relating all that had passed, her suspicions of



<P>Willoughby's inconstancy, urging her by every plea



<P>of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account



<P>of her real situation with respect to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap



<P>foretold a visitor, and Colonel Brandon was announced.



<P>Marianne, who had seen him from the window, and who hated



<P>company of any kind, left the room before he entered it.



<P>He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing



<P>satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he



<P>had somewhat in particular to tell her, sat for some



<P>time without saying a word.&nbsp; Elinor, persuaded that he



<P>had some communication to make in which her sister



<P>was concerned, impatiently expected its opening.



<P>It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind



<P>of conviction; for, more than once before, beginning with



<P>the observation of "your sister looks unwell to-day,"



<P>or "your sister seems out of spirits," he had appeared



<P>on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring,



<P>something particular about her.&nbsp; After a pause of several



<P>minutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her



<P>in a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate



<P>her on the acquisition of a brother?&nbsp; Elinor was not



<P>prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready,



<P>was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient,



<P>of asking what he meant?&nbsp; He tried to smile as he replied,



<P>"your sister's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It cannot be generally known," returned Elinor,



<P>"for her own family do not know it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked surprised and said, "I beg your pardon,



<P>I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not



<P>supposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond,



<P>and their marriage is universally talked of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can that be? By whom can you have heard



<P>it mentioned?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By many--by some of whom you know nothing,

by others



<P>with whom you are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer,



<P>and the Middletons.&nbsp; But still I might not have believed it,



<P>for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to



<P>be convinced, it will always find something to support



<P>its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,



<P>accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to



<P>Mr. Willoughby in your sister's writing.&nbsp; I came to inquire,



<P>but I was convinced before I could ask the question.



<P>Is every thing finally settled?&nbsp; Is it impossible to-?



<P>But I have no right, and I could have no chance of succeeding.



<P>Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.&nbsp; I believe I have been wrong



<P>in saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on



<P>your prudence I have the strongest dependence.&nbsp; Tell me



<P>that it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt,



<P>that in short concealment, if concealment be possible,



<P>is all that remains."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct

avowal



<P>of his love for her sister, affected her very much.



<P>She was not immediately able to say anything, and even



<P>when her spirits were recovered, she debated for a short



<P>time, on the answer it would be most proper to give.



<P>The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister



<P>was so little known to herself, that in endeavouring



<P>to explain it, she might be as liable to say too much



<P>as too little.&nbsp; Yet as she was convinced that Marianne's



<P>affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel



<P>Brandon's success, whatever the event of that affection



<P>might be, and at the same time wished to shield her conduct



<P>from censure, she thought it most prudent and kind,



<P>after some consideration, to say more than she really knew



<P>or believed.&nbsp; She acknowledged, therefore, that though



<P>she had never been informed by themselves of the terms



<P>on which they stood with each other, of their mutual



<P>affection she had no doubt, and of their correspondence



<P>she was not astonished to hear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He listened to her with silent attention, and

on



<P>her ceasing to speak, rose directly from his seat,



<P>and after saying in a voice of emotion, "to your sister



<P>I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he



<P>may endeavour to deserve her,"--took leave, and went away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from

this



<P>conversation, to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on



<P>other points; she was left, on the contrary, with a



<P>melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon's unhappiness,



<P>and was prevented even from wishing it removed,



<P>by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some opposition, Marianne yielded to

her



<P>sister's entreaties, and consented to go out with her



<P>and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an hour. She



<P>expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits,



<P>and would do no more than accompany them to Gray's in



<P>Sackville Street, where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation



<P>for the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings

recollected



<P>that there was a lady at the other end of the street



<P>on whom she ought to call; and as she had no business



<P>at Gray's, it was resolved, that while her young friends



<P>transacted their's, she should pay her visit and



<P>return for them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods

found



<P>so many people before them in the room, that there was



<P>not a person at liberty to tend to their orders; and they



<P>were obliged to wait.&nbsp; All that could be done was, to sit



<P>down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the



<P>quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there,



<P>and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope



<P>of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch.



<P>But the correctness of his eye, and the delicacy



<P>of his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness.



<P>He was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself,



<P>and till its size, shape, and ornaments were determined,



<P>all of which, after examining and debating for a quarter



<P>of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop,



<P>were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had



<P>no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies,



<P>than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares;



<P>a kind of notice which served to imprint on Elinor



<P>the remembrance of a person and face, of strong,



<P>natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in



<P>the first style of fashion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings



<P>of contempt and resentment, on this impertinent examination



<P>of their features, and on the puppyism of his manner



<P>in deciding on all the different horrors of the different



<P>toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining



<P>unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect



<P>her thoughts within herself, and be as ignorant of what was



<P>passing around her, in Mr. Gray's shop, as in her own bedroom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last the affair was decided.&nbsp; The ivory,



<P>the gold, and the pearls, all received their appointment,



<P>and the gentleman having named the last day on which his



<P>existence could be continued without the possession of the



<P>toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care,



<P>and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such



<P>a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration,



<P>walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor lost no time in bringing her business

forward,



<P>was on the point of concluding it, when another gentleman



<P>presented himself at her side.&nbsp; She turned her eyes towards



<P>his face, and found him with some surprise to be her brother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their affection and pleasure in meeting was

just enough



<P>to make a very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray's shop.



<P>John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see



<P>his sisters again; it rather gave them satisfaction;



<P>and his inquiries after their mother were respectful



<P>and attentive.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in

town



<P>two days.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wished very much to call upon you yesterday,"



<P>said he, "but it was impossible, for we were obliged



<P>to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange;



<P>and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars.



<P>Harry was vastly pleased.&nbsp; THIS morning I had fully intended



<P>to call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour,



<P>but one has always so much to do on first coming to town.



<P>I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal.&nbsp; But tomorrow I



<P>think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street,



<P>and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings.



<P>I understand she is a woman of very good fortune.



<P>And the Middletons too, you must introduce me to THEM.



<P>As my mother-in-law's relations, I shall be happy to show



<P>them every respect.&nbsp; They are excellent neighbours to you in



<P>the country, I understand."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Excellent indeed.&nbsp; Their attention to

our comfort,



<P>their friendliness in every particular, is more than I



<P>can express."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word;



<P>extremely glad indeed.&nbsp; But so it ought to be; they are



<P>people of large fortune, they are related to you, and



<P>every civility and accommodation that can serve to make



<P>your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected.



<P>And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage



<P>and want for nothing!&nbsp; Edward brought us a most charming



<P>account of the place: the most complete thing of its kind,



<P>he said, that ever was, and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond



<P>any thing.&nbsp; It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it,



<P>I assure you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother;



<P>and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him,



<P>by the arrival of Mrs. Jennings's servant, who came to tell



<P>her that his mistress waited for them at the door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was

introduced



<P>to Mrs. Jennings at the door of her carriage, and repeating



<P>his hope of being able to call on them the next day,



<P>took leave.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His visit was duly paid.&nbsp; He came with

a pretence at



<P>an apology from their sister-in-law, for not coming too;



<P>"but she was so much engaged with her mother, that really



<P>she had no leisure for going any where."&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings,



<P>however, assured him directly, that she should not stand



<P>upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something



<P>like it, and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John



<P>Dashwood very soon, and bring her sisters to see her.



<P>His manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectly kind;



<P>to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel



<P>Brandon's coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a



<P>curiosity which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know



<P>him to be rich, to be equally civil to HIM.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After staying with them half an hour, he asked



<P>Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street, and introduce



<P>him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.&nbsp; The weather was



<P>remarkably fine, and she readily consented.&nbsp; As soon



<P>as they were out of the house, his enquiries began.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is Colonel Brandon?&nbsp; Is he a man

of fortune?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am glad of it.&nbsp; He seems a most gentlemanlike

man;



<P>and I think, Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect



<P>of a very respectable establishment in life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me, brother! what do you mean?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He likes you.&nbsp; I observed him narrowly,

and am



<P>convinced of it.&nbsp; What is the amount of his fortune?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe about two thousand a year."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two thousand a-year;" and then working himself



<P>up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity, he added,



<P>"Elinor, I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much,



<P>for your sake."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed I believe you," replied Elinor; "but

I am



<P>very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish



<P>of marrying ME."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much

mistaken.



<P>A very little trouble on your side secures him.



<P>Perhaps just at present he may be undecided; the smallness



<P>of your fortune may make him hang back; his friends



<P>may all advise him against it.&nbsp; But some of those little



<P>attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily



<P>give will fix him, in spite of himself.&nbsp; And there can be



<P>no reason why you should not try for him.&nbsp; It is not to be



<P>supposed that any prior attachment on your side--in short,



<P>you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite



<P>out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--



<P>you have too much sense not to see all that.&nbsp; Colonel Brandon



<P>must be the man; and no civility shall be wanting on



<P>my part to make him pleased with you and your family.



<P>It is a match that must give universal satisfaction.



<P>In short, it is a kind of thing that"--lowering his voice



<P>to an important whisper--"will be exceedingly welcome



<P>to ALL PARTIES." Recollecting himself, however, he added,



<P>"That is, I mean to say--your friends are all truly



<P>anxious to see you well settled; Fanny particularly,



<P>for she has your interest very much at heart, I assure you.



<P>And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman,



<P>I am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much



<P>the other day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It would be something remarkable, now," he

continued,



<P>"something droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I



<P>a sister settling at the same time.&nbsp; And yet it is not



<P>very unlikely."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Mr. Edward Ferrars," said Elinor, with

resolution,



<P>"going to be married?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not actually settled, but there is such



<P>a thing in agitation.&nbsp; He has a most excellent mother.



<P>Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality, will come forward,



<P>and settle on him a thousand a year, if the match



<P>takes place.&nbsp; The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter



<P>of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds.



<P>A very desirable connection on both sides, and I have not



<P>a doubt of its taking place in time.&nbsp; A thousand a-year



<P>is a great deal for a mother to give away, to make over



<P>for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit.&nbsp; To give



<P>you another instance of her liberality:--The other day,



<P>as soon as we came to town, aware that money could



<P>not be very plenty with us just now, she put bank-notes



<P>into Fanny's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds.



<P>And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great



<P>expense while we are here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused for her assent and compassion; and

she



<P>forced herself to say,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your expenses both in town and country must

certainly



<P>be considerable; but your income is a large one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose.



<P>I do not mean to complain, however; it is undoubtedly



<P>a comfortable one, and I hope will in time be better.



<P>The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on,



<P>is a most serious drain.&nbsp; And then I have made a little



<P>purchase within this half year; East Kingham Farm,



<P>you must remember the place, where old Gibson used to live.



<P>The land was so very desirable for me in every respect,



<P>so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it



<P>my duty to buy it.&nbsp; I could not have answered it to my



<P>conscience to let it fall into any other hands.&nbsp; A man must



<P>pay for his convenience; and it HAS cost me a vast deal



<P>of money."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "More than you think it really and intrinsically

worth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, I hope not that.&nbsp; I might have sold

it again,



<P>the next day, for more than I gave: but, with regard to the



<P>purchase-money, I might have been very unfortunate indeed;



<P>for the stocks were at that time so low, that if I had not



<P>happened to have the necessary sum in my banker's hands,



<P>I must have sold out to very great loss."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could only smile.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Other great and inevitable expenses too we

have



<P>had on first coming to Norland.&nbsp; Our respected father,



<P>as you well know, bequeathed all the Stanhill effects



<P>that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)



<P>to your mother.&nbsp; Far be it from me to repine at his



<P>doing so; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his



<P>own property as he chose, but, in consequence of it,



<P>we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen,



<P>china, &amp;c. to supply the place of what was taken away.



<P>You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we



<P>must be from being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars's



<P>kindness is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly," said Elinor; "and assisted by

her liberality,



<P>I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Another year or two may do much towards it,"



<P>he gravely replied; "but however there is still a great



<P>deal to be done.&nbsp; There is not a stone laid of Fanny's



<P>green-house, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden



<P>marked out."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the green-house to be?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon the knoll behind the house.&nbsp; The

old



<P>walnut trees are all come down to make room for it.



<P>It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park,



<P>and the flower-garden will slope down just before it,



<P>and be exceedingly pretty.&nbsp; We have cleared away all the old



<P>thorns that grew in patches over the brow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor kept her concern and her censure to

herself;



<P>and was very thankful that Marianne was not present,



<P>to share the provocation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having now said enough to make his poverty

clear,



<P>and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings



<P>for each of his sisters, in his next visit at Gray's



<P>his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he began to



<P>congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her

house,



<P>her style of living, all bespeak an exceeding good income;



<P>and it is an acquaintance that has not only been



<P>of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may prove



<P>materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is



<P>certainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it



<P>speaks altogether so great a regard for you, that in all



<P>probability when she dies you will not be forgotten.--



<P>She must have a great deal to leave."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for

she has



<P>only her jointure, which will descend to her children."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it is not to be imagined that she lives

up to



<P>her income.&nbsp; Few people of common prudence will do THAT;



<P>and whatever she saves, she will be able to dispose of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And do you not think it more likely that she



<P>should leave it to her daughters, than to us?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Her daughters are both exceedingly well married,



<P>and therefore I cannot perceive the necessity of her



<P>remembering them farther.&nbsp; Whereas, in my opinion, by her



<P>taking so much notice of you, and treating you in this



<P>kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on her



<P>future consideration, which a conscientious woman would



<P>not disregard.&nbsp; Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour;



<P>and she can hardly do all this, without being aware



<P>of the expectation it raises."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she raises none in those most concerned.



<P>Indeed, brother, your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity



<P>carries you too far."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, to be sure," said he, seeming to recollect

himself,



<P>"people have little, have very little in their power.



<P>But, my dear Elinor, what is the matter with Marianne?--



<P>she looks very unwell, has lost her colour, and is grown



<P>quite thin.&nbsp; Is she ill?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint



<P>on her for several weeks."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry for that.&nbsp; At her time of

life,



<P>any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever!



<P>Her's has been a very short one!&nbsp; She was as handsome a girl



<P>last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to attract



<P>the man.&nbsp; There was something in her style of beauty,



<P>to please them particularly.&nbsp; I remember Fanny used to say



<P>that she would marry sooner and better than you did;



<P>not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU, but so it



<P>happened to strike her.&nbsp; She will be mistaken, however.



<P>I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth



<P>more than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost,



<P>and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better.



<P>Dorsetshire!&nbsp; I know very little of Dorsetshire; but, my dear



<P>Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;



<P>and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself



<P>among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor tried very seriously to convince him

that



<P>there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon;



<P>but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself



<P>to be relinquished, and he was really resolved on seeking



<P>an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the marriage



<P>by every possible attention.&nbsp; He had just compunction



<P>enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself,



<P>to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should



<P>do a great deal; and an offer from Colonel Brandon,



<P>or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means



<P>of atoning for his own neglect.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton



<P>at home, and Sir John came in before their visit ended.



<P>Abundance of civilities passed on all sides.&nbsp; Sir John



<P>was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did



<P>not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him



<P>down as a very good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton



<P>saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his



<P>acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood went away



<P>delighted with both.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I shall have a charming account to carry



<P>to Fanny," said he, as he walked back with his sister.



<P>"Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman!&nbsp; Such



<P>a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know.



<P>And Mrs. Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman,



<P>though not so elegant as her daughter.&nbsp; Your sister need



<P>not have any scruple even of visiting HER, which, to say



<P>the truth, has been a little the case, and very naturally;



<P>for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man



<P>who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and



<P>Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed, that neither



<P>she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny



<P>would like to associate with.&nbsp; But now I can carry her



<P>a most satisfactory account of both."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending

a large



<P>portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends,



<P>she was not without a settled habitation of her own.



<P>Since the death of her husband, who had traded with success



<P>in a less elegant part of the town, she had resided every



<P>winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman Square.



<P>Towards this home, she began on the approach of January



<P>to turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly,



<P>and very unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses



<P>Dashwood to accompany her.&nbsp; Elinor, without observing



<P>the varying complexion of her sister, and the animated look



<P>which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave



<P>a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she



<P>believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations.



<P>The reason alleged was their determined resolution



<P>of not leaving their mother at that time of the year.



<P>Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise,



<P>and repeated her invitation immediately.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare

you



<P>very well, and I DO beg you will favour me with



<P>your company, for I've quite set my heart upon it.



<P>Don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me,



<P>for I shan't put myself at all out of my way for you.



<P>It will only be sending Betty by the coach, and I



<P>hope I can afford THAT.&nbsp; We three shall be able to go



<P>very well in my chaise; and when we are in town,



<P>if you do not like to go wherever I do, well and good,



<P>you may always go with one of my daughters.&nbsp; I am sure



<P>your mother will not object to it; for I have had such



<P>good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she



<P>will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you;



<P>and if I don't get one of you at least well married



<P>before I have done with you, it shall not be my fault.



<P>I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men,



<P>you may depend upon it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a notion," said Sir John, "that Miss

Marianne



<P>would not object to such a scheme, if her elder sister



<P>would come into it.&nbsp; It is very hard indeed that she



<P>should not have a little pleasure, because Miss Dashwood



<P>does not wish it.&nbsp; So I would advise you two, to set off



<P>for town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying



<P>a word to Miss Dashwood about it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nay," cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am sure I shall

be



<P>monstrous glad of Miss Marianne's company, whether Miss



<P>Dashwood will go or not, only the more the merrier say I,



<P>and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to



<P>be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk



<P>to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back.



<P>But one or the other, if not both of them, I must have.



<P>Lord bless me! how do you think I can live poking by myself,



<P>I who have been always used till this winter to have



<P>Charlotte with me.&nbsp; Come, Miss Marianne, let us strike



<P>hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change



<P>her mind by and bye, why so much the better."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thank you, ma'am, sincerely thank you,"

said Marianne,



<P>with warmth: "your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever,



<P>and it would give me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest



<P>happiness I am capable of, to be able to accept it.



<P>But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--I feel the



<P>justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be



<P>made less happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no,



<P>nothing should tempt me to leave her.&nbsp; It should not,



<P>must not be a struggle."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs.

Dashwood



<P>could spare them perfectly well; and Elinor, who now



<P>understood her sister, and saw to what indifference to



<P>almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness



<P>to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct



<P>opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her



<P>mother's decision, from whom however she scarcely expected



<P>to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit,



<P>which she could not approve of for Marianne, and which



<P>on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid.



<P>Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her mother would be eager



<P>to promote--she could not expect to influence the latter



<P>to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she



<P>had never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she



<P>dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination



<P>for going to London.&nbsp; That Marianne, fastidious as she was,



<P>thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings' manners,



<P>and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook every



<P>inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever



<P>must be most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her



<P>pursuit of one object, was such a proof, so strong,



<P>so full, of the importance of that object to her, as Elinor,



<P>in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to witness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood,



<P>persuaded that such an excursion would be productive



<P>of much amusement to both her daughters, and perceiving



<P>through all her affectionate attention to herself,



<P>how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear



<P>of their declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on



<P>their both accepting it directly; and then began to foresee,



<P>with her usual cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that



<P>would accrue to them all, from this separation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am delighted with the plan," she cried,



<P>"it is exactly what I could wish.&nbsp; Margaret and I shall



<P>be as much benefited by it as yourselves.&nbsp; When you



<P>and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly



<P>and happily together with our books and our music! You



<P>will find Margaret so improved when you come back again!



<P>I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too,



<P>which may now be performed without any inconvenience



<P>to any one.&nbsp; It is very right that you SHOULD go to town;



<P>I would have every young woman of your condition in life



<P>acquainted with the manners and amusements of London.



<P>You will be under the care of a motherly good sort



<P>of woman, of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt.



<P>And in all probability you will see your brother,



<P>and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,



<P>when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so



<P>wholly estranged from each other."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,"



<P>said Elinor, "you have been obviating every impediment



<P>to the present scheme which occurred to you, there is



<P>still one objection which, in my opinion, cannot be so



<P>easily removed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's countenance sunk.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what," said Mrs. Dashwood, "is my dear

prudent



<P>Elinor going to suggest?&nbsp; What formidable obstacle is she



<P>now to bring forward?&nbsp; Do let me hear a word about the



<P>expense of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My objection is this; though I think very

well of



<P>Mrs. Jennings's heart, she is not a woman whose society



<P>can afford us pleasure, or whose protection will give



<P>us consequence."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is very true," replied her mother, "but

of



<P>her society, separately from that of other people,



<P>you will scarcely have any thing at all, and you will



<P>almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike

of



<P>Mrs. Jennings," said Marianne, "at least it need not prevent



<P>MY accepting her invitation.&nbsp; I have no such scruples,



<P>and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness



<P>of that kind with very little effort."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not help smiling at this display

of



<P>indifference towards the manners of a person, to whom she



<P>had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave



<P>with tolerable politeness; and resolved within herself,



<P>that if her sister persisted in going, she would



<P>go likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne



<P>should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment,



<P>or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy



<P>of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours.



<P>To this determination she was the more easily reconciled,



<P>by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account,



<P>was not to be in town before February; and that



<P>their visit, without any unreasonable abridgement,



<P>might be previously finished.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will have you BOTH go," said Mrs. Dashwood;



<P>"these objections are nonsensical.&nbsp; You will have much



<P>pleasure in being in London, and especially in being together;



<P>and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment,



<P>she would foresee it there from a variety of sources;



<P>she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her



<P>acquaintance with her sister-in-law's family."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had often wished for an opportunity

of



<P>attempting to weaken her mother's dependence on the



<P>attachment of Edward and herself, that the shock might



<P>be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now



<P>on this attack, though almost hopeless of success,



<P>she forced herself to begin her design by saying,



<P>as calmly as she could, "I like Edward Ferrars very much,



<P>and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest



<P>of the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference



<P>to me, whether I am ever known to them or not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing.



<P>Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment, and Elinor



<P>conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After very little farther discourse, it was

finally



<P>settled that the invitation should be fully accepted.



<P>Mrs. Jennings received the information with a great



<P>deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness and care;



<P>nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her.&nbsp; Sir John



<P>was delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety



<P>was the dread of being alone, the acquisition of two,



<P>to the number of inhabitants in London, was something.



<P>Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being delighted,



<P>which was putting herself rather out of her way;



<P>and as for the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had



<P>never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence



<P>made them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted



<P>her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected



<P>to feel.&nbsp; With regard to herself, it was now a matter



<P>of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and when



<P>she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan,



<P>and her sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner,



<P>restored to all her usual animation, and elevated to more



<P>than her usual gaiety, she could not be dissatisfied



<P>with the cause, and would hardly allow herself to distrust



<P>the consequence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness,



<P>so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her



<P>impatience to be gone.&nbsp; Her unwillingness to quit her



<P>mother was her only restorative to calmness; and at the



<P>moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.



<P>Her mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elinor



<P>was the only one of the three, who seemed to consider



<P>the separation as any thing short of eternal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their departure took place in the first week

in January.



<P>The Middletons were to follow in about a week.&nbsp; The Miss



<P>Steeles kept their station at the park, and were to quit



<P>it only with the rest of the family.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a night of more sleep than she had expected,



<P>Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness



<P>of misery in which she had closed her eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to

talk



<P>of what she felt; and before breakfast was ready, they had



<P>gone through the subject again and again; and with the same



<P>steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor's side,



<P>the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on



<P>Marianne's, as before.&nbsp; Sometimes she could believe



<P>Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself,



<P>and at others, lost every consolation in the impossibility



<P>of acquitting him.&nbsp; At one moment she was absolutely



<P>indifferent to the observation of all the world, at another



<P>she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third



<P>could resist it with energy.&nbsp; In one thing, however,



<P>she was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding,



<P>where it was possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings,



<P>and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it.



<P>Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings's



<P>entering into her sorrows with any compassion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, no, it cannot be," she cried;



<P>"she cannot feel.&nbsp; Her kindness is not sympathy;



<P>her good-nature is not tenderness.&nbsp; All that she wants



<P>is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had not needed this to be assured of

the injustice



<P>to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others,



<P>by the irritable refinement of her own mind, and the too



<P>great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a



<P>strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished manner.



<P>Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there



<P>be that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent



<P>abilities and an excellent disposition, was neither



<P>reasonable nor candid.&nbsp; She expected from other people



<P>the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she judged



<P>of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions



<P>on herself.&nbsp; Thus a circumstance occurred, while the



<P>sisters were together in their own room after breakfast,



<P>which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower



<P>in her estimation; because, through her own weakness,



<P>it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself,



<P>though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse



<P>of the utmost goodwill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a letter in her outstretched hand, and

countenance



<P>gaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort,



<P>she entered their room, saying,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, my dear, I bring you something that I

am sure



<P>will do you good."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne heard enough.&nbsp; In one moment

her imagination



<P>placed before her a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness



<P>and contrition, explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory,



<P>convincing; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself,



<P>rushing eagerly into the room to inforce, at her feet,



<P>by the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances of his letter.



<P>The work of one moment was destroyed by the next.



<P>The hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome,



<P>was before her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment



<P>which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope,



<P>she felt as if, till that instant, she had never suffered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within



<P>her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence,



<P>could have expressed; and now she could reproach her



<P>only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with



<P>passionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely



<P>lost on its object, that after many expressions of pity,



<P>she withdrew, still referring her to the letter of comfort.



<P>But the letter, when she was calm enough to read it,



<P>brought little comfort.&nbsp; Willoughby filled every page.



<P>Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying



<P>as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused



<P>by Elinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater



<P>openness towards them both; and this, with such tenderness



<P>towards her, such affection for Willoughby, and such



<P>a conviction of their future happiness in each other,



<P>that she wept with agony through the whole of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All her impatience to be at home again now

returned;



<P>her mother was dearer to her than ever; dearer through



<P>the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby,



<P>and she was wildly urgent to be gone.&nbsp; Elinor, unable herself



<P>to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be



<P>in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own



<P>except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known;



<P>and at length she obtained her sister's consent to wait



<P>for that knowledge.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual;

for she



<P>could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able



<P>to grieve as much as herself; and positively refusing



<P>Elinor's offered attendance, went out alone for the rest



<P>of the morning.&nbsp; Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of



<P>the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving,



<P>by Marianne's letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying



<P>any foundation for it, then sat down to write her mother



<P>an account of what had passed, and entreat her directions



<P>for the future; while Marianne, who came into the drawing-room



<P>on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the table



<P>where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen,



<P>grieving over her for the hardship of such a task,



<P>and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this manner they had continued about a quarter



<P>of an hour, when Marianne, whose nerves could not then



<P>bear any sudden noise, was startled by a rap at the door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can this be?" cried Elinor.&nbsp; "So

early too! I



<P>thought we HAD been safe."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne moved to the window--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is Colonel Brandon!" said she, with vexation.



<P>"We are never safe from HIM."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from

home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will not trust to THAT," retreating to her

own room.



<P>"A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no



<P>conscience in his intrusion on that of others."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The event proved her conjecture right, though

it



<P>was founded on injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon



<P>DID come in; and Elinor, who was convinced that



<P>solicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who saw



<P>THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look,



<P>and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her,



<P>could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street," said

he,



<P>after the first salutation, "and she encouraged me



<P>to come on; and I was the more easily encouraged,



<P>because I thought it probable that I might find you alone,



<P>which I was very desirous of doing.&nbsp; My object--my



<P>wish--my sole wish in desiring it--I hope, I believe



<P>it is--is to be a means of giving comfort;--no, I must



<P>not say comfort--not present comfort--but conviction,



<P>lasting conviction to your sister's mind.&nbsp; My regard for her,



<P>for yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it,



<P>by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY



<P>sincere regard--nothing but an earnest desire of being



<P>useful--I think I am justified--though where so many hours



<P>have been spent in convincing myself that I am right,



<P>is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong?"



<P>He stopped.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand you," said Elinor.&nbsp; "You

have something



<P>to tell me of Mr. Willoughby, that will open his character



<P>farther.&nbsp; Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship



<P>that can be shewn Marianne.&nbsp; MY gratitude will be insured



<P>immediately by any information tending to that end, and HERS



<P>must be gained by it in time.&nbsp; Pray, pray let me hear it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted

Barton



<P>last October,--but this will give you no idea--I must go



<P>farther back.&nbsp; You will find me a very awkward narrator,



<P>Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin.&nbsp; A short



<P>account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it



<P>SHALL be a short one.&nbsp; On such a subject," sighing heavily,



<P>"can I have little temptation to be diffuse."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopt a moment for recollection, and then,



<P>with another sigh, went on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--



<P>(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression



<P>on you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton



<P>Park--it was the evening of a dance--in which I alluded



<P>to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some measure,



<P>your sister Marianne."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed," answered Elinor, "I have NOT forgotten

it."



<P>He looked pleased by this remembrance, and added,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the

partiality



<P>of tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance



<P>between them, as well in mind as person.&nbsp; The same warmth



<P>of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits.



<P>This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from



<P>her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.



<P>Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years



<P>we were playfellows and friends.&nbsp; I cannot remember the



<P>time when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her,



<P>as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my



<P>present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me



<P>incapable of having ever felt.&nbsp; Her's, for me, was, I believe,



<P>fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby



<P>and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.



<P>At seventeen she was lost to me for ever.&nbsp; She was



<P>married--married against her inclination to my brother.



<P>Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.



<P>And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the



<P>conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.



<P>My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.



<P>I had hoped that her regard for me would support her



<P>under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at



<P>last the misery of her situation, for she experienced



<P>great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though



<P>she had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I



<P>relate!&nbsp; I have never told you how this was brought on.



<P>We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland.



<P>The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin's maid betrayed us.



<P>I was banished to the house of a relation far distant,



<P>and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,



<P>till my father's point was gained.&nbsp; I had depended on her



<P>fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one--



<P>but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was,



<P>a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least



<P>I should not have now to lament it.&nbsp; This however



<P>was not the case.&nbsp; My brother had no regard for her;



<P>his pleasures were not what they ought to have been,



<P>and from the first he treated her unkindly.&nbsp; The consequence



<P>of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced



<P>as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural.&nbsp; She resigned



<P>herself at first to all the misery of her situation;



<P>and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those



<P>regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned.&nbsp; But can we



<P>wonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy,



<P>and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for



<P>my father lived only a few months after their marriage,



<P>and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she



<P>should fall?&nbsp; Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I



<P>meant to promote the happiness of both by removing



<P>from her for years, and for that purpose had procured



<P>my exchange.&nbsp; The shock which her marriage had given me,"



<P>he continued, in a voice of great agitation, "was of



<P>trifling weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard,



<P>about two years afterwards, of her divorce.&nbsp; It was



<P>THAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection



<P>of what I suffered--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could say no more, and rising hastily walked

for a few



<P>minutes about the room.&nbsp; Elinor, affected by his relation,



<P>and still more by his distress, could not speak.&nbsp; He saw



<P>her concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it,



<P>and kissed it with grateful respect.&nbsp; A few minutes more



<P>of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was nearly three years after this unhappy



<P>period before I returned to England.&nbsp; My first care,



<P>when I DID arrive, was of course to seek for her;



<P>but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy.



<P>I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there



<P>was every reason to fear that she had removed from him



<P>only to sink deeper in a life of sin.&nbsp; Her legal allowance



<P>was not adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her



<P>comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my brother that



<P>the power of receiving it had been made over some months



<P>before to another person.&nbsp; He imagined, and calmly could he



<P>imagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress,



<P>had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief.



<P>At last, however, and after I had been six months in England,



<P>I DID find her.&nbsp; Regard for a former servant of my own,



<P>who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit



<P>him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt;



<P>and there, the same house, under a similar confinement,



<P>was my unfortunate sister.&nbsp; So altered--so faded--worn



<P>down by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could I



<P>believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me,



<P>to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,



<P>on whom I had once doted.&nbsp; What I endured in so beholding



<P>her--but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting



<P>to describe it--I have pained you too much already.



<P>That she was, to all appearance, in the last stage



<P>of a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was



<P>my greatest comfort.&nbsp; Life could do nothing for her,



<P>beyond giving time for a better preparation for death;



<P>and that was given.&nbsp; I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings,



<P>and under proper attendants; I visited her every day



<P>during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her



<P>last moments."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor



<P>spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern,



<P>at the fate of his unfortunate friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,"

said he,



<P>"by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my



<P>poor disgraced relation.&nbsp; Their fates, their fortunes,



<P>cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet



<P>disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind,



<P>or a happier marriage, she might have been all that you



<P>will live to see the other be.&nbsp; But to what does all this



<P>lead?&nbsp; I seem to have been distressing you for nothing.



<P>Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched



<P>for fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!



<P>I WILL be more collected--more concise.&nbsp; She left to my care



<P>her only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first



<P>guilty connection, who was then about three years old.



<P>She loved the child, and had always kept it with her.



<P>It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly



<P>would I have discharged it in the strictest sense,



<P>by watching over her education myself, had the nature



<P>of our situations allowed it; but I had no family, no home;



<P>and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school.



<P>I saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my



<P>brother, (which happened about five years ago, and which



<P>left to me the possession of the family property,) she



<P>visited me at Delaford.&nbsp; I called her a distant relation;



<P>but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected



<P>of a much nearer connection with her.&nbsp; It is now three



<P>years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,)



<P>that I removed her from school, to place her under the care



<P>of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire,



<P>who had the charge of four or five other girls of about



<P>the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason



<P>to be pleased with her situation.&nbsp; But last February,



<P>almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.



<P>I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned



<P>out,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of



<P>her young friends, who was attending her father there



<P>for his health.&nbsp; I knew him to be a very good sort of man,



<P>and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved,



<P>for, with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy,



<P>she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though she



<P>certainly knew all.&nbsp; He, her father, a well-meaning,



<P>but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe,



<P>give no information; for he had been generally confined



<P>to the house, while the girls were ranging over the town



<P>and making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried



<P>to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself,



<P>of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business.



<P>In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone;



<P>all the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.



<P>What I thought, what I feared, may be imagined; and what I



<P>suffered too."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good heavens!" cried Elinor, "could it be--could



<P>Willoughby!"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first news that reached me of her," he

continued,



<P>"came in a letter from herself, last October.



<P>It was forwarded to me from Delaford, and I received it



<P>on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell;



<P>and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,



<P>which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange



<P>to every body, and which I believe gave offence to some.



<P>Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine, I suppose, when his



<P>looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party,



<P>that I was called away to the relief of one whom he



<P>had made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it,



<P>what would it have availed?&nbsp; Would he have been less



<P>gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister?&nbsp; No,



<P>he had already done that, which no man who CAN feel



<P>for another would do.&nbsp; He had left the girl whose



<P>youth and innocence he had seduced, in a situation of



<P>the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help,



<P>no friends, ignorant of his address!&nbsp; He had left her,



<P>promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote,



<P>nor relieved her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is beyond every thing!" exclaimed Elinor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His character is now before you; expensive,

dissipated,



<P>and worse than both.&nbsp; Knowing all this, as I have now



<P>known it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing



<P>your sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured



<P>that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt



<P>for all your sakes.&nbsp; When I came to you last week and



<P>found you alone, I came determined to know the truth;



<P>though irresolute what to do when it WAS known.



<P>My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then;



<P>but now you will comprehend it.&nbsp; To suffer you all to be



<P>so deceived; to see your sister--but what could I do?



<P>I had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes



<P>I thought your sister's influence might yet reclaim him.



<P>But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what



<P>were his designs on her.&nbsp; Whatever they may have been,



<P>however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless WILL



<P>turn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she



<P>compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers



<P>the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl,



<P>and pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong,



<P>still as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented



<P>by self-reproach, which must attend her through life.



<P>Surely this comparison must have its use with her.



<P>She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.&nbsp; They



<P>proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.



<P>On the contrary, every friend must be made still more



<P>her friend by them.&nbsp; Concern for her unhappiness,



<P>and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen



<P>every attachment.&nbsp; Use your own discretion, however,



<P>in communicating to her what I have told you.&nbsp; You must



<P>know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously,



<P>and from my heart believed it might be of service,



<P>might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered



<P>myself to trouble you with this account of my family



<P>afflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been



<P>intended to raise myself at the expense of others."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful



<P>earnestness; attended too with the assurance of her



<P>expecting material advantage to Marianne, from the



<P>communication of what had passed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been more pained," said she, "by her



<P>endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest; for it



<P>irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction



<P>of his unworthiness can do.&nbsp; Now, though at first she



<P>will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier.



<P>Have you," she continued, after a short silence,



<P>"ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," he replied gravely, "once I have.&nbsp;

One meeting



<P>was unavoidable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, startled by his manner, looked at him

anxiously,



<P>saying,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What? have you met him to--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I could meet him no other way.&nbsp; Eliza

had confessed



<P>to me, though most reluctantly, the name of her lover;



<P>and when he returned to town, which was within a fortnight



<P>after myself, we met by appointment, he to defend,



<P>I to punish his conduct.&nbsp; We returned unwounded,



<P>and the meeting, therefore, never got abroad."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of

this;



<P>but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Such," said Colonel Brandon, after a pause,



<P>"has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother



<P>and daughter! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is she still in town?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in,



<P>for I found her near her delivery, I removed her and her



<P>child into the country, and there she remains."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was

probably



<P>dividing Elinor from her sister, he put an end to his visit,



<P>receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments,



<P>and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was

earnestly



<P>pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he



<P>were bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved



<P>to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at



<P>the height.&nbsp; His spirits, during the last two or three days,



<P>though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he grew



<P>more and more partial to the house and environs--never



<P>spoke of going away without a sigh--declared his time



<P>to be wholly disengaged--even doubted to what place he



<P>should go when he left them--but still, go he must.



<P>Never had any week passed so quickly--he could hardly



<P>believe it to be gone.&nbsp; He said so repeatedly; other things



<P>he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave



<P>the lie to his actions.&nbsp; He had no pleasure at Norland;



<P>he detested being in town; but either to Norland or London,



<P>he must go.&nbsp; He valued their kindness beyond any thing,



<P>and his greatest happiness was in being with them.



<P>Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite



<P>of their wishes and his own, and without any restraint



<P>on his time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this



<P>way of acting to his mother's account; and it was



<P>happy for her that he had a mother whose character



<P>was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general



<P>excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son.



<P>Disappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes



<P>displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself,



<P>she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions



<P>with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,



<P>which had been rather more painfully extorted from her,



<P>for Willoughby's service, by her mother.&nbsp; His want of spirits,



<P>of openness, and of consistency, were most usually



<P>attributed to his want of independence, and his better



<P>knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition and designs.



<P>The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose



<P>in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination,



<P>the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.



<P>The old well-established grievance of duty against will,



<P>parent against child, was the cause of all.&nbsp; She would have



<P>been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease,



<P>this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would



<P>be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.



<P>But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort



<P>to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection,



<P>to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word



<P>which fell from him while at Barton, and above all



<P>to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore



<P>round his finger.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think, Edward," said Mrs. Dashwood, as they

were



<P>at breakfast the last morning, "you would be a happier man



<P>if you had any profession to engage your time and give



<P>an interest to your plans and actions.&nbsp; Some inconvenience



<P>to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you



<P>would not be able to give them so much of your time.



<P>But (with a smile) you would be materially benefited



<P>in one particular at least--you would know where to go



<P>when you left them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do assure you," he replied, "that I have

long



<P>thought on this point, as you think now.&nbsp; It has been,



<P>and is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune



<P>to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage me,



<P>no profession to give me employment, or afford me any



<P>thing like independence.&nbsp; But unfortunately my own nicety,



<P>and the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am,



<P>an idle, helpless being.&nbsp; We never could agree in our



<P>choice of a profession.&nbsp; I always preferred the church,



<P>as I still do.&nbsp; But that was not smart enough for my family.



<P>They recommended the army.&nbsp; That was a great deal



<P>too smart for me.&nbsp; The law was allowed to be genteel



<P>enough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple,



<P>made a very good appearance in the first circles,



<P>and drove about town in very knowing gigs.&nbsp; But I had



<P>no inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse



<P>study of it, which my family approved.&nbsp; As for the navy,



<P>it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the



<P>subject was first started to enter it--and, at length,



<P>as there was no necessity for my having any profession



<P>at all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without



<P>a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced



<P>on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable,



<P>and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly



<P>bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his



<P>friends to do nothing.&nbsp; I was therefore entered at Oxford



<P>and have been properly idle ever since."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The consequence of which, I suppose, will

be,"



<P>said Mrs. Dashwood, "since leisure has not promoted



<P>your own happiness, that your sons will be brought up



<P>to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades



<P>as Columella's."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They will be brought up," said he, in a serious

accent,



<P>"to be as unlike myself as is possible.&nbsp; In feeling,



<P>in action, in condition, in every thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate



<P>want of spirits, Edward.&nbsp; You are in a melancholy humour,



<P>and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy.



<P>But remember that the pain of parting from friends



<P>will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their



<P>education or state.&nbsp; Know your own happiness.&nbsp; You want



<P>nothing but patience--or give it a more fascinating name,



<P>call it hope.&nbsp; Your mother will secure to you, in time,



<P>that independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty,



<P>and it will, it must ere long become her happiness to



<P>prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.



<P>How much may not a few months do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think," replied Edward, "that I may defy

many



<P>months to produce any good to me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This desponding turn of mind, though it could

not



<P>be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain



<P>to them all in the parting, which shortly took place,



<P>and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's



<P>feelings especially, which required some trouble and time



<P>to subdue.&nbsp; But as it was her determination to subdue it,



<P>and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than



<P>what all her family suffered on his going away, she did



<P>not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne,



<P>on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow,



<P>by seeking silence, solitude and idleness.&nbsp; Their means



<P>were as different as their objects, and equally suited



<P>to the advancement of each.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon

as he



<P>was out of the house, busily employed herself the whole day,



<P>neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name,



<P>appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the



<P>general concerns of the family, and if, by this conduct,



<P>she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented



<P>from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters



<P>were spared much solicitude on her account.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse



<P>of her own, appeared no more meritorious to Marianne,



<P>than her own had seemed faulty to her.&nbsp; The business



<P>of self-command she settled very easily;--with strong



<P>affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could



<P>have no merit.&nbsp; That her sister's affections WERE calm,



<P>she dared not deny, though she blushed to acknowledge it;



<P>and of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof,



<P>by still loving and respecting that sister, in spite



<P>of this mortifying conviction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without shutting herself up from her family,



<P>or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them,



<P>or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation,



<P>Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough



<P>to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every



<P>possible variety which the different state of her spirits



<P>at different times could produce,--with tenderness,



<P>pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.&nbsp; There were moments



<P>in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her mother



<P>and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,



<P>conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect



<P>of solitude was produced.&nbsp; Her mind was inevitably



<P>at liberty; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere;



<P>and the past and the future, on a subject so interesting,



<P>must be before her, must force her attention, and engross



<P>her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at

her



<P>drawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after



<P>Edward's leaving them, by the arrival of company.



<P>She happened to be quite alone.&nbsp; The closing of the



<P>little gate, at the entrance of the green court in front



<P>of the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw



<P>a large party walking up to the door.&nbsp; Amongst them



<P>were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,



<P>but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were



<P>quite unknown to her.&nbsp; She was sitting near the window,



<P>and as soon as Sir John perceived her, he left the rest



<P>of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door,



<P>and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open the



<P>casement to speak to him, though the space was so short



<P>between the door and the window, as to make it hardly



<P>possible to speak at one without being heard at the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," said he, "we have brought you some

strangers.



<P>How do you like them?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hush! they will hear you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Never mind if they do.&nbsp; It is only the

Palmers.



<P>Charlotte is very pretty, I can tell you.&nbsp; You may see her



<P>if you look this way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple



<P>of minutes, without taking that liberty, she begged



<P>to be excused.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is Marianne? Has she run away because

we



<P>are come? I see her instrument is open."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is walking, I believe."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who

had not



<P>patience enough to wait till the door was opened before



<P>she told HER story.&nbsp; She came hallooing to the window,



<P>"How do you do, my dear?&nbsp; How does Mrs. Dashwood do?



<P>And where are your sisters?&nbsp; What! all alone! you



<P>will be glad of a little company to sit with you.



<P>I have brought my other son and daughter to see you.



<P>Only think of their coming so suddenly!&nbsp; I thought I heard



<P>a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,



<P>but it never entered my head that it could be them.



<P>I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel



<P>Brandon come back again; so I said to Sir John, I do think



<P>I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come



<P>back again"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the

middle



<P>of her story, to receive the rest of the party; Lady



<P>Middleton introduced the two strangers; Mrs. Dashwood



<P>and Margaret came down stairs at the same time, and they



<P>all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings



<P>continued her story as she walked through the passage



<P>into the parlour, attended by Sir John.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than

Lady



<P>Middleton, and totally unlike her in every respect.



<P>She was short and plump, had a very pretty face,



<P>and the finest expression of good humour in it that could



<P>possibly be.&nbsp; Her manners were by no means so elegant



<P>as her sister's, but they were much more prepossessing.



<P>She came in with a smile, smiled all the time of her visit,



<P>except when she laughed, and smiled when she went away.



<P>Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six



<P>and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than



<P>his wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased.



<P>He entered the room with a look of self-consequence,



<P>slightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word,



<P>and, after briefly surveying them and their apartments,



<P>took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it



<P>as long as he staid.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly

endowed



<P>by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy,



<P>was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour



<P>and every thing in it burst forth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well! what a delightful room this is! I never



<P>saw anything so charming!&nbsp; Only think, Mamma, how it



<P>is improved since I was here last! I always thought it



<P>such a sweet place, ma'am! (turning to Mrs. Dashwood)



<P>but you have made it so charming!&nbsp; Only look, sister,



<P>how delightful every thing is! How I should like such



<P>a house for myself!&nbsp; Should not you, Mr. Palmer?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not

even raise



<P>his eyes from the newspaper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Palmer does not hear me," said she, laughing;



<P>"he never does sometimes.&nbsp; It is so ridiculous!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood;

she had



<P>never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one,



<P>and could not help looking with surprise at them both.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as

loud



<P>as she could, and continued her account of their surprise,



<P>the evening before, on seeing their friends, without



<P>ceasing till every thing was told.&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer laughed



<P>heartily at the recollection of their astonishment,



<P>and every body agreed, two or three times over, that it



<P>had been quite an agreeable surprise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may believe how glad we all were to see

them,"



<P>added Mrs. Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor,



<P>and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard



<P>by no one else, though they were seated on different sides



<P>of the room; "but, however, I can't help wishing they had



<P>not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey



<P>of it, for they came all round by London upon account



<P>of some business, for you know (nodding significantly and



<P>pointing to her daughter) it was wrong in her situation.



<P>I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning,



<P>but she would come with us; she longed so much to see



<P>you all!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not

do her



<P>any harm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She expects to be confined in February,"



<P>continued Mrs. Jennings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton could no longer endure such

a conversation,



<P>and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there



<P>was any news in the paper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, none at all," he replied, and read on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here comes Marianne," cried Sir John.&nbsp;

"Now, Palmer,



<P>you shall see a monstrous pretty girl."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He immediately went into the passage, opened

the front door,



<P>and ushered her in himself.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings asked her,



<P>as soon as she appeared, if she had not been to Allenham;



<P>and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question,



<P>as to show she understood it.&nbsp; Mr. Palmer looked up



<P>on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes,



<P>and then returned to his newspaper.&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer's eye



<P>was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room.



<P>She got up to examine them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!&nbsp; Well!

how delightful!



<P>Do but look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming;



<P>I could look at them for ever." And then sitting down again,



<P>she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer



<P>rose also, laid down the newspaper, stretched himself



<P>and looked at them all around.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My love, have you been asleep?" said his wife,

laughing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made her no answer; and only observed, after

again



<P>examining the room, that it was very low pitched,



<P>and that the ceiling was crooked.&nbsp; He then made his bow,



<P>and departed with the rest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir John had been very urgent with them all

to



<P>spend the next day at the park.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood, who did



<P>not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined



<P>at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;



<P>her daughters might do as they pleased.&nbsp; But they had no



<P>curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner,



<P>and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way.



<P>They attempted, therefore, likewise, to excuse themselves;



<P>the weather was uncertain, and not likely to be good.



<P>But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage should



<P>be sent for them and they must come.&nbsp; Lady Middleton too,



<P>though she did not press their mother, pressed them.



<P>Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties, all



<P>seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party; and the young



<P>ladies were obliged to yield.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why should they ask us?" said Marianne, as

soon as they



<P>were gone.&nbsp; "The rent of this cottage is said to be low;



<P>but we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine



<P>at the park whenever any one is staying either with them,



<P>or with us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They mean no less to be civil and kind to

us now,"



<P>said Elinor, "by these frequent invitations, than by



<P>those which we received from them a few weeks ago.



<P>The alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown



<P>tedious and dull.&nbsp; We must look for the change elsewhere."

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits



<P>of her friend.&nbsp; His visit afforded her but a very



<P>partial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it



<P>appeared so imperfect.&nbsp; It was evident that he was unhappy;



<P>she wished it were equally evident that he still



<P>distinguished her by the same affection which once



<P>she had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the



<P>continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain;



<P>and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted



<P>one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room



<P>the next morning before the others were down; and Marianne,



<P>who was always eager to promote their happiness as far



<P>as she could, soon left them to themselves.&nbsp; But before she



<P>was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open, and,



<P>turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself come out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going into the village to see my horses,"



<P>said be, "as you are not yet ready for breakfast; I shall



<P>be back again presently."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

***

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward returned to them with fresh admiration



<P>of the surrounding country; in his walk to the village,



<P>he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage;



<P>and the village itself, in a much higher situation than



<P>the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had



<P>exceedingly pleased him.&nbsp; This was a subject which ensured



<P>Marianne's attention, and she was beginning to describe



<P>her own admiration of these scenes, and to question him more



<P>minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him,



<P>when Edward interrupted her by saying, "You must not



<P>enquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge



<P>in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance



<P>and want of taste if we come to particulars.&nbsp; I shall call



<P>hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange



<P>and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged;



<P>and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be



<P>indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.



<P>You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can



<P>honestly give.&nbsp; I call it a very fine country--the



<P>hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber,



<P>and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich



<P>meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here



<P>and there.&nbsp; It exactly answers my idea of a fine country,



<P>because it unites beauty with utility--and I dare say it



<P>is a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can



<P>easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories,



<P>grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.



<P>I know nothing of the picturesque."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid it is but too true," said Marianne;



<P>"but why should you boast of it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suspect," said Elinor, "that to avoid one

kind



<P>of affectation, Edward here falls into another.&nbsp; Because he



<P>believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties



<P>of nature than they really feel, and is disgusted with



<P>such pretensions, he affects greater indifference and less



<P>discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses.



<P>He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is very true," said Marianne, "that admiration



<P>of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon.



<P>Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with



<P>the taste and elegance of him who first defined what



<P>picturesque beauty was.&nbsp; I detest jargon of every kind,



<P>and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself,



<P>because I could find no language to describe them



<P>in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am convinced," said Edward, "that you really

feel



<P>all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess



<P>to feel.&nbsp; But, in return, your sister must allow me



<P>to feel no more than I profess.&nbsp; I like a fine prospect,



<P>but not on picturesque principles.&nbsp; I do not like crooked,



<P>twisted, blasted trees.&nbsp; I admire them much more if they



<P>are tall, straight, and flourishing.&nbsp; I do not like ruined,



<P>tattered cottages.&nbsp; I am not fond of nettles or thistles,



<P>or heath blossoms.&nbsp; I have more pleasure in a snug



<P>farm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy,



<P>happy villages please me better than the finest banditti



<P>in the world."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne looked with amazement at Edward,



<P>with compassion at her sister.&nbsp; Elinor only laughed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne



<P>remained thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly



<P>engaged her attention.&nbsp; She was sitting by Edward, and



<P>in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood, his hand passed



<P>so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait



<P>of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,"

she cried.



<P>"Is that Fanny's hair? I remember her promising to give



<P>you some.&nbsp; But I should have thought her hair had been darker."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really

felt--



<P>but when she saw how much she had pained Edward, her own



<P>vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed



<P>by his.&nbsp; He coloured very deeply, and giving a momentary



<P>glance at Elinor, replied, "Yes; it is my sister's hair.



<P>The setting always casts a different shade on it,



<P>you know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious

likewise.



<P>That the hair was her own, she instantaneously felt as



<P>well satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their



<P>conclusions was, that what Marianne considered as a free



<P>gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must have been



<P>procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.



<P>She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront,



<P>and affecting to take no notice of what passed,



<P>by instantly talking of something else, she internally



<P>resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing



<P>the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt,



<P>that it was exactly the shade of her own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and

it



<P>ended in an absence of mind still more settled.



<P>He was particularly grave the whole morning.



<P>Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said;



<P>but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy,



<P>had she known how little offence it had given her sister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the middle of the day, they were visited

by Sir



<P>John and Mrs. Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival



<P>of a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey



<P>of the guest.&nbsp; With the assistance of his mother-in-law,



<P>Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of



<P>Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine



<P>of raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but



<P>the newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have



<P>prevented from being immediately sprung.&nbsp; But, as it was,



<P>she only learned, from some very significant looks, how far



<P>their penetration, founded on Margaret's instructions, extended.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without

either



<P>inviting them to dine at the park the next day, or to drink



<P>tea with them that evening.&nbsp; On the present occasion,



<P>for the better entertainment of their visitor, towards



<P>whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute,



<P>he wished to engage them for both.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You MUST drink tea with us to night," said

he,



<P>"for we shall be quite alone--and tomorrow you must



<P>absolutely dine with us, for we shall be a large party."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity.&nbsp;

"And who knows



<P>but you may raise a dance," said she.&nbsp; "And that will



<P>tempt YOU, Miss Marianne."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A dance!" cried Marianne.&nbsp; "Impossible!

Who is to dance?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers



<P>to be sure.--What! you thought nobody could dance



<P>because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish with all my soul," cried Sir John,



<P>"that Willoughby were among us again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions



<P>to Edward.&nbsp; "And who is Willoughby?" said he, in a low voice,



<P>to Miss Dashwood, by whom he was sitting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave him a brief reply.&nbsp; Marianne's

countenance



<P>was more communicative.&nbsp; Edward saw enough to comprehend,



<P>not only the meaning of others, but such of Marianne's



<P>expressions as had puzzled him before; and when their



<P>visitors left them, he went immediately round her, and said,



<P>in a whisper, "I have been guessing.&nbsp; Shall I tell you



<P>my guess?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shall I tell you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she

could



<P>not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner,



<P>and after a moment's silence, said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will

come



<P>I hope...I am sure you will like him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not doubt it," replied he, rather astonished



<P>at her earnestness and warmth; for had he not imagined it



<P>to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general,



<P>founded only on a something or a nothing between Mr. Willoughby



<P>and herself, he would not have ventured to mention it.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room

on her return,



<P>and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered,



<P>opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you do my dear?"--said she in a voice

of great



<P>compassion to Marianne, who turned away her face without



<P>attempting to answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is she, Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing! she

looks very bad.--



<P>No wonder.&nbsp; Ay, it is but too true.&nbsp; He is to be married



<P>very soon--a good-for-nothing fellow!&nbsp; I have no patience



<P>with him.&nbsp; Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago,



<P>and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss



<P>Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it;



<P>and I was almost ready to sink as it was.&nbsp; Well, said I,



<P>all I can say is, that if this be true, he has used



<P>a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill, and I



<P>wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out.



<P>And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it.



<P>I have no notion of men's going on in this way; and if ever



<P>I meet him again, I will give him such a dressing as he



<P>has not had this many a day.&nbsp; But there is one comfort,



<P>my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the only young man



<P>in the world worth having; and with your pretty face



<P>you will never want admirers.&nbsp; Well, poor thing!&nbsp; I won't



<P>disturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry



<P>out at once and have done with.&nbsp; The Parrys and Sandersons



<P>luckily are coming tonight you know, and that will amuse her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of

the room,



<P>as if she supposed her young friend's affliction could



<P>be increased by noise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne, to the surprise of her sister,



<P>determined on dining with them.&nbsp; Elinor even advised



<P>her against it.&nbsp; But "no, she would go down; she could



<P>bear it very well, and the bustle about her would



<P>be less."&nbsp; Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a



<P>moment by such a motive, though believing it hardly



<P>possible that she could sit out the dinner, said no more;



<P>and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,



<P>while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready



<P>to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were



<P>summoned to it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When there, though looking most wretchedly,



<P>she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected.



<P>Had she tried to speak, or had she been conscious of half



<P>Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged attentions



<P>to her, this calmness could not have been maintained;



<P>but not a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction



<P>of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing



<P>that was passing before her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's

kindness,



<P>though its effusions were often distressing, and sometimes



<P>almost ridiculous, made her those acknowledgments,



<P>and returned her those civilities, which her sister could



<P>not make or return for herself.&nbsp; Their good friend saw



<P>that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing



<P>was due to her which might make her at all less so.



<P>She treated her therefore, with all the indulgent fondness



<P>of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of



<P>its holidays.&nbsp; Marianne was to have the best place by the fire,



<P>was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house,



<P>and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day.



<P>Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister,



<P>seen a check to all mirth, she could have been entertained



<P>by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure a disappointment in love,



<P>by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a good fire.



<P>As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was



<P>forced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could



<P>stay no longer.&nbsp; With a hasty exclamation of Misery,



<P>and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got



<P>up and hurried out of the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor soul!" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as

she was gone,



<P>"how it grieves me to see her!&nbsp; And I declare if she is



<P>not gone away without finishing her wine!&nbsp; And the dried



<P>cherries too!&nbsp; Lord! nothing seems to do her any good.



<P>I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I would



<P>send all over the town for it.&nbsp; Well, it is the oddest



<P>thing to me, that a man should use such a pretty girl



<P>so ill!&nbsp; But when there is plenty of money on one side,



<P>and next to none on the other, Lord bless you! they care



<P>no more about such things!--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lady then--Miss Grey I think you called

her--



<P>is very rich?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.&nbsp; Did

you ever see



<P>her? a smart, stylish girl they say, but not handsome.



<P>I remember her aunt very well, Biddy Henshawe; she married



<P>a very wealthy man.&nbsp; But the family are all rich together.



<P>Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it won't come



<P>before it's wanted; for they say he is all to pieces.



<P>No wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters!



<P>Well, it don't signify talking; but when a young man,



<P>be who he will, comes and makes love to a pretty girl,



<P>and promises marriage, he has no business to fly off



<P>from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer



<P>girl is ready to have him.&nbsp; Why don't he, in such a case,



<P>sell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants,



<P>and make a thorough reform at once? I warrant you,



<P>Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters



<P>came round.&nbsp; But that won't do now-a-days; nothing in the



<P>way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of



<P>this age."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey

is?



<P>Is she said to be amiable?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly

ever



<P>heard her mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say



<P>this morning, that one day Miss Walker hinted to her,



<P>that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry



<P>to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison could



<P>never agree."--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And who are the Ellisons?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Her guardians, my dear.&nbsp; But now she

is of age



<P>and may choose for herself; and a pretty choice she has



<P>made!--What now," after pausing a moment--"your poor sister



<P>is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan by herself.



<P>Is there nothing one can get to comfort her?&nbsp; Poor dear,



<P>it seems quite cruel to let her be alone.&nbsp; Well, by-and-by we



<P>shall have a few friends, and that will amuse her a little.



<P>What shall we play at?&nbsp; She hates whist I know; but is there



<P>no round game she cares for?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear ma'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary.



<P>Marianne, I dare say, will not leave her room again



<P>this evening.&nbsp; I shall persuade her if I can to go



<P>early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye, I believe that will be best for her.&nbsp;

Let her name



<P>her own supper, and go to bed.&nbsp; Lord! no wonder she has



<P>been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two,



<P>for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as



<P>long as that.&nbsp; And so the letter that came today finished it!



<P>Poor soul!&nbsp; I am sure if I had had a notion of it,



<P>I would not have joked her about it for all my money.



<P>But then you know, how should I guess such a thing?&nbsp; I made



<P>sure of its being nothing but a common love letter, and



<P>you know young people like to be laughed at about them.&nbsp; Lord!



<P>how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they



<P>hear it!&nbsp; If I had my senses about me I might have called



<P>in Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it.



<P>But I shall see them tomorrow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you

to caution



<P>Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby,



<P>or making the slightest allusion to what has passed,



<P>before my sister.&nbsp; Their own good-nature must point out



<P>to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing



<P>about it when she is present; and the less that may ever



<P>be said to myself on the subject, the more my feelings



<P>will be spared, as you my dear madam will easily believe."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed.&nbsp; It

must be terrible



<P>for you to hear it talked of; and as for your sister,



<P>I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her



<P>for the world.&nbsp; You saw I did not all dinner time.



<P>No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are



<P>all very thoughtful and considerate; especially if I



<P>give them a hint, as I certainly will.&nbsp; For my part,



<P>I think the less that is said about such things, the better,



<P>the sooner 'tis blown over and forgot.&nbsp; And what does



<P>talking ever do you know?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this affair it can only do harm; more so



<P>perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind, for it



<P>has been attended by circumstances which, for the sake



<P>of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become



<P>the public conversation.&nbsp; I must do THIS justice to



<P>Mr. Willoughby--he has broken no positive engagement



<P>with my sister."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Law, my dear!&nbsp; Don't pretend to defend

him.



<P>No positive engagement indeed! after taking her all



<P>over Allenham House, and fixing on the very rooms they



<P>were to live in hereafter!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, for her sister's sake, could not press

the



<P>subject farther, and she hoped it was not required of her



<P>for Willoughby's; since, though Marianne might lose much,



<P>he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth.



<P>After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,



<P>with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, my dear, 'tis a true saying about an

ill-wind,



<P>for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon.



<P>He will have her at last; aye, that he will.&nbsp; Mind me,



<P>now, if they an't married by Mid-summer.&nbsp; Lord! how he'll



<P>chuckle over this news!&nbsp; I hope he will come tonight.



<P>It will be all to one a better match for your sister.



<P>Two thousand a year without debt or drawback--except



<P>the little love-child, indeed; aye, I had forgot her;



<P>but she may be 'prenticed out at a small cost, and then



<P>what does it signify?&nbsp; Delaford is a nice place, I can



<P>tell you; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place,



<P>full of comforts and conveniences; quite shut in with great



<P>garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees



<P>in the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner!



<P>Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we



<P>were there!&nbsp; Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful



<P>stew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; and every thing,



<P>in short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it is



<P>close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile from



<P>the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only



<P>go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house,



<P>you may see all the carriages that pass along.



<P>Oh! 'tis a nice place!&nbsp; A butcher hard by in the village,



<P>and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw.



<P>To my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park,



<P>where they are forced to send three miles for their meat,



<P>and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother.



<P>Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can.



<P>One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down.



<P>If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ay, if we can do THAT, Ma'am," said Elinor,



<P>"we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon."



<P>And then rising, she went away to join Marianne,



<P>whom she found, as she expected, in her own room, leaning,



<P>in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire,



<P>which, till Elinor's entrance, had been her only light.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You had better leave me," was all the notice



<P>that her sister received from her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will leave you," said Elinor, "if you will

go



<P>to bed." But this, from the momentary perverseness



<P>of impatient suffering, she at first refused to do.



<P>Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion, however,



<P>soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her



<P>lay her aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped,



<P>in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired,



<P>she was soon joined by Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass,



<P>full of something, in her hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear," said she, entering, "I have just

recollected



<P>that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the



<P>house that ever was tasted, so I have brought a glass of it



<P>for your sister.&nbsp; My poor husband! how fond he was of it!



<P>Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout, he said



<P>it did him more good than any thing else in the world.



<P>Do take it to your sister."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear Ma'am," replied Elinor, smiling at the

difference



<P>of the complaints for which it was recommended, "how good



<P>you are!&nbsp; But I have just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope,



<P>almost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much



<P>service to her as rest, if you will give me leave,



<P>I will drink the wine myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had

not been



<P>five minutes earlier, was satisfied with the compromise;



<P>and Elinor, as she swallowed the chief of it, reflected,



<P>that though its effects on a colicky gout were, at present,



<P>of little importance to her, its healing powers,



<P>on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried



<P>on herself as on her sister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon came in while the party were

at tea,



<P>and by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne,



<P>Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected



<P>nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he



<P>was already aware of what occasioned her absence.



<P>Mrs. Jennings was not struck by the same thought;



<P>for soon after his entrance, she walked across the room



<P>to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered--



<P>"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.&nbsp; He knows



<P>nothing of it; do tell him, my dear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to

her's,



<P>and, with a look which perfectly assured her of his



<P>good information, inquired after her sister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marianne is not well," said she.&nbsp; "She

has been



<P>indisposed all day, and we have persuaded her to go to bed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps, then," he hesitatingly replied, "what

I



<P>heard this morning may be--there may be more truth in it



<P>than I could believe possible at first."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you hear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in

short,



<P>that a man, whom I KNEW to be engaged--but how shall I



<P>tell you?&nbsp; If you know it already, as surely you must,



<P>I may be spared."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean," answered Elinor, with forced calmness,



<P>"Mr. Willoughby's marriage with Miss Grey.&nbsp; Yes, we DO



<P>know it all.&nbsp; This seems to have been a day of general



<P>elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded it to us.



<P>Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable!&nbsp; Where did you hear it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where

I



<P>had business.&nbsp; Two ladies were waiting for their carriage,



<P>and one of them was giving the other an account of the



<P>intended match, in a voice so little attempting concealment,



<P>that it was impossible for me not to hear all.&nbsp; The name



<P>of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated,



<P>first caught my attention; and what followed was a positive



<P>assertion that every thing was now finally settled



<P>respecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was no longer



<P>to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,



<P>with many particulars of preparations and other matters.



<P>One thing, especially, I remember, because it served



<P>to identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony



<P>was over, they were to go to Combe Magna, his seat



<P>in Somersetshire.&nbsp; My astonishment!--but it would be



<P>impossible to describe what I felt.&nbsp; The communicative



<P>lady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop



<P>till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and that, as I



<P>have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey's guardian."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is.&nbsp; But have you likewise heard that

Miss Grey



<P>has fifty thousand pounds?&nbsp; In that, if in any thing,



<P>we may find an explanation."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at

least



<P>I think"--he stopped a moment; then added in a voice



<P>which seemed to distrust itself, "And your sister--



<P>how did she--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Her sufferings have been very severe.&nbsp;

I have



<P>only to hope that they may be proportionately short.



<P>It has been, it is a most cruel affliction.&nbsp; Till yesterday,



<P>I believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now,



<P>perhaps--but I am almost convinced that he never was



<P>really attached to her.&nbsp; He has been very deceitful! and,



<P>in some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah!" said Colonel Brandon, "there is, indeed!&nbsp;

But



<P>your sister does not--I think you said so--she does



<P>not consider quite as you do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know her disposition, and may believe

how eagerly



<P>she would still justify him if she could."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by

the removal



<P>of the tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties,



<P>the subject was necessarily dropped.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, who had



<P>watched them with pleasure while they were talking, and who



<P>expected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood's communication,



<P>in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon's side,



<P>as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of hope



<P>and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole



<P>evening more serious and thoughtful than usual.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus

began.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should be undeserving of the confidence

you have



<P>honoured me with, if I felt no desire for its continuance,



<P>or no farther curiosity on its subject.&nbsp; I will



<P>not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you," cried Lucy warmly, "for breaking



<P>the ice; you have set my heart at ease by it; for I was



<P>somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I



<P>told you that Monday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe

me,"



<P>and Elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity,



<P>"nothing could be farther from my intention than to give



<P>you such an idea.&nbsp; Could you have a motive for the trust,



<P>that was not honourable and flattering to me?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And yet I do assure you," replied Lucy, her

little



<P>sharp eyes full of meaning, "there seemed to me to be



<P>a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me



<P>quite uncomfortable.&nbsp; I felt sure that you was angry with me;



<P>and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for having



<P>took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs.



<P>But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy,



<P>and that you really do not blame me.&nbsp; If you knew what a



<P>consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you



<P>of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life,



<P>your compassion would make you overlook every thing else



<P>I am sure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a

very great



<P>relief to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and be



<P>assured that you shall never have reason to repent it.



<P>Your case is a very unfortunate one; you seem to me to



<P>be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have need



<P>of all your mutual affection to support you under them.



<P>Mr. Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He has only two thousand pounds of his own;

it would



<P>be madness to marry upon that, though for my own part,



<P>I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh.



<P>I have been always used to a very small income, and could



<P>struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too well



<P>to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that



<P>his mother might give him if he married to please her.



<P>We must wait, it may be for many years.&nbsp; With almost every



<P>other man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect;



<P>but Edward's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of



<P>I know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That conviction must be every thing to you;



<P>and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your's.



<P>If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed,



<P>as between many people, and under many circumstances



<P>it naturally would during a four years' engagement,



<P>your situation would have been pitiable, indeed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful



<P>in guarding her countenance from every expression



<P>that could give her words a suspicious tendency.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Edward's love for me," said Lucy, "has been

pretty



<P>well put to the test, by our long, very long absence



<P>since we were first engaged, and it has stood the trial



<P>so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now.



<P>I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment's



<P>alarm on that account from the first."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh



<P>at this assertion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy went on.&nbsp; "I am rather of a jealous

temper too



<P>by nature, and from our different situations in life,



<P>from his being so much more in the world than me, and our



<P>continual separation, I was enough inclined for suspicion,



<P>to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been



<P>the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met,



<P>or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for,



<P>or if he had talked more of one lady than another,



<P>or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he



<P>used to be.&nbsp; I do not mean to say that I am particularly



<P>observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case



<P>I am sure I could not be deceived."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All this," thought Elinor, "is very pretty;



<P>but it can impose upon neither of us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what," said she after a short silence,



<P>"are your views? or have you none but that of waiting for



<P>Mrs. Ferrars's death, which is a melancholy and shocking



<P>extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to this,



<P>and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense



<P>in which it may involve you, rather than run the risk



<P>of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we could be certain that it would be only



<P>for a while!&nbsp; But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong



<P>proud woman, and in her first fit of anger upon hearing



<P>it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert,



<P>and the idea of that, for Edward's sake, frightens away



<P>all my inclination for hasty measures."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And for your own sake too, or you are carrying



<P>your disinterestedness beyond reason."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?" asked Elinor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he



<P>is very unlike his brother--silly and a great coxcomb."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A great coxcomb!" repeated Miss Steele, whose

ear had



<P>caught those words by a sudden pause in Marianne's music.--



<P>"Oh, they are talking of their favourite beaux, I dare say."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No sister," cried Lucy, "you are mistaken

there, our



<P>favourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood's is

not,"



<P>said Mrs. Jennings, laughing heartily; "for he is one



<P>of the modestest, prettiest behaved young men I ever saw;



<P>but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little creature,



<P>there is no finding out who SHE likes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh," cried Miss Steele, looking significantly

round



<P>at them, "I dare say Lucy's beau is quite as modest



<P>and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood's."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor blushed in spite of herself.&nbsp; Lucy

bit her lip,



<P>and looked angrily at her sister.&nbsp; A mutual silence took



<P>place for some time.&nbsp; Lucy first put an end to it by saying



<P>in a lower tone, though Marianne was then giving them



<P>the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will honestly tell you of one scheme which

has



<P>lately come into my head, for bringing matters to bear;



<P>indeed I am bound to let you into the secret, for you



<P>are a party concerned.&nbsp; I dare say you have seen enough



<P>of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every



<P>other profession; now my plan is that he should take



<P>orders as soon as he can, and then through your interest,



<P>which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of



<P>friendship for him, and I hope out of some regard to me,



<P>your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living;



<P>which I understand is a very good one, and the present



<P>incumbent not likely to live a great while.&nbsp; That would



<P>be enough for us to marry upon, and we might trust to time



<P>and chance for the rest."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should always be happy," replied Elinor,

"to show



<P>any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars;



<P>but do you not perceive that my interest on such an



<P>occasion would be perfectly unnecessary?&nbsp; He is brother



<P>to Mrs. John Dashwood--THAT must be recommendation enough



<P>to her husband."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve



<P>of Edward's going into orders."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I rather suspect that my interest would



<P>do very little."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were again silent for many minutes.&nbsp;

At length



<P>Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe it would be the wisest way to put

an end



<P>to the business at once by dissolving the engagement.



<P>We seem so beset with difficulties on every side,



<P>that though it would make us miserable for a time,



<P>we should be happier perhaps in the end.&nbsp; But you will



<P>not give me your advice, Miss Dashwood?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," answered Elinor, with a smile, which

concealed



<P>very agitated feelings, "on such a subject I certainly



<P>will not.&nbsp; You know very well that my opinion would have



<P>no weight with you, unless it were on the side of your wishes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed you wrong me," replied Lucy, with great



<P>solemnity; "I know nobody of whose judgment I think



<P>so highly as I do of yours; and I do really believe,



<P>that if you was to say to me, 'I advise you by all means



<P>to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars,



<P>it will be more for the happiness of both of you,'



<P>I should resolve upon doing it immediately."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward's



<P>future wife, and replied, "This compliment would effectually



<P>frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject



<P>had I formed one.&nbsp; It raises my influence much too high;



<P>the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached



<P>is too much for an indifferent person."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Tis because you are an indifferent person,"

said Lucy,



<P>with some pique, and laying a particular stress on those words,



<P>"that your judgment might justly have such weight with me.



<P>If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect



<P>by your own feelings, your opinion would not be worth having."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer

to this,



<P>lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase



<P>of ease and unreserve; and was even partly determined



<P>never to mention the subject again.&nbsp; Another pause



<P>therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeded this speech,



<P>and Lucy was still the first to end it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?"



<P>said she with all her accustomary complacency.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry for that," returned the other,



<P>while her eyes brightened at the information,



<P>"it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there!



<P>But I dare say you will go for all that.&nbsp; To be sure,



<P>your brother and sister will ask you to come to them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will not be in my power to accept their

invitation



<P>if they do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How unlucky that is! I had quite depended

upon



<P>meeting you there.&nbsp; Anne and me are to go the latter end



<P>of January to some relations who have been wanting us to



<P>visit them these several years!&nbsp; But I only go for the sake



<P>of seeing Edward.&nbsp; He will be there in February, otherwise



<P>London would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was soon called to the card-table by

the



<P>conclusion of the first rubber, and the confidential



<P>discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end,



<P>to which both of them submitted without any reluctance,



<P>for nothing had been said on either side to make them



<P>dislike each other less than they had done before;



<P>and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy



<P>persuasion that Edward was not only without affection



<P>for the person who was to be his wife; but that he had



<P>not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage,



<P>which sincere affection on HER side would have given,



<P>for self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man



<P>to an engagement, of which she seemed so thoroughly aware



<P>that he was weary.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this time the subject was never revived

by Elinor,



<P>and when entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity



<P>of introducing it, and was particularly careful to inform



<P>her confidante, of her happiness whenever she received a letter



<P>from Edward, it was treated by the former with calmness



<P>and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility would allow;



<P>for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which



<P>Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park

was



<P>lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied.



<P>Their favour increased; they could not be spared;



<P>Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite



<P>of their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter,



<P>in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill



<P>them immediately, which was in full force at the end



<P>of every week, they were prevailed on to stay nearly two



<P>months at the park, and to assist in the due celebration



<P>of that festival which requires a more than ordinary



<P>share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim



<P>its importance.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.



<P>She had only two daughters, both of whom she had lived



<P>to see respectably married, and she had now therefore



<P>nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world.



<P>In the promotion of this object she was zealously active,



<P>as far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity



<P>of projecting weddings among all the young people



<P>of her acquaintance.&nbsp; She was remarkably quick in the



<P>discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the advantage



<P>of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young



<P>lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man;



<P>and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her



<P>arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel



<P>Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood.



<P>She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first



<P>evening of their being together, from his listening



<P>so attentively while she sang to them; and when the visit



<P>was returned by the Middletons' dining at the cottage,



<P>the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.



<P>It must be so.&nbsp; She was perfectly convinced of it.



<P>It would be an excellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE



<P>was handsome.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings had been anxious to see



<P>Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her connection



<P>with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge;



<P>and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every



<P>pretty girl.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The immediate advantage to herself was by no

means



<P>inconsiderable, for it supplied her with endless jokes



<P>against them both.&nbsp; At the park she laughed at the colonel,



<P>and in the cottage at Marianne.&nbsp; To the former her



<P>raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,



<P>perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at



<P>first incomprehensible; and when its object was understood,



<P>she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity,



<P>or censure its impertinence, for she considered it as an



<P>unfeeling reflection on the colonel's advanced years,



<P>and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five

years



<P>younger than herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared



<P>to the youthful fancy of her daughter, ventured to clear



<P>Mrs. Jennings from the probability of wishing to throw



<P>ridicule on his age.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But at least, Mamma, you cannot deny the absurdity



<P>of the accusation, though you may not think it intentionally



<P>ill-natured.&nbsp; Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than



<P>Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MY father;



<P>and if he were ever animated enough to be in love,



<P>must have long outlived every sensation of the kind.



<P>It is too ridiculous!&nbsp; When is a man to be safe from such wit,



<P>if age and infirmity will not protect him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Infirmity!" said Elinor, "do you call Colonel

Brandon



<P>infirm?&nbsp; I can easily suppose that his age may appear much



<P>greater to you than to my mother; but you can hardly



<P>deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?



<P>and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dearest child," said her mother, laughing,



<P>"at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay;



<P>and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been



<P>extended to the advanced age of forty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mamma, you are not doing me justice.&nbsp;

I know very well



<P>that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends



<P>yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature.



<P>He may live twenty years longer.&nbsp; But thirty-five has



<P>nothing to do with matrimony."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps," said Elinor, "thirty-five and seventeen

had



<P>better not have any thing to do with matrimony together.



<P>But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman



<P>who is single at seven and twenty, I should not think



<P>Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five any objection to his



<P>marrying HER."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A woman of seven and twenty," said Marianne,



<P>after pausing a moment, "can never hope to feel or inspire



<P>affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable,



<P>or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might



<P>bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse,



<P>for the sake of the provision and security of a wife.



<P>In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be



<P>nothing unsuitable.&nbsp; It would be a compact of convenience,



<P>and the world would be satisfied.&nbsp; In my eyes it would



<P>be no marriage at all, but that would be nothing.



<P>To me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which



<P>each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It would be impossible, I know," replied Elinor,



<P>"to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could



<P>feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough



<P>to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.



<P>But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and



<P>his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber,



<P>merely because he chanced to complain yesterday (a



<P>very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in one



<P>of his shoulders."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But he talked of flannel waistcoats," said

Marianne;



<P>"and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected



<P>with aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of



<P>ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Had he been only in a violent fever, you would

not



<P>have despised him half so much.&nbsp; Confess, Marianne, is not



<P>there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek,



<P>hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving the

room,



<P>"Mamma," said Marianne, "I have an alarm on the subject



<P>of illness which I cannot conceal from you.&nbsp; I am sure



<P>Edward Ferrars is not well.&nbsp; We have now been here almost



<P>a fortnight, and yet he does not come.&nbsp; Nothing but real



<P>indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.



<P>What else can detain him at Norland?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Had you any idea of his coming so soon?"



<P>said Mrs. Dashwood.&nbsp; "I had none.&nbsp; On the contrary,



<P>if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject, it has



<P>been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want



<P>of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation,



<P>when I talked of his coming to Barton.&nbsp; Does Elinor



<P>expect him already?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never mentioned it to her, but of course



<P>she must."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I rather think you are mistaken, for when

I



<P>was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate



<P>for the spare bedchamber, she observed that there



<P>was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely



<P>that the room would be wanted for some time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How strange this is! what can be the meaning

of it!



<P>But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been



<P>unaccountable! How cold, how composed were their last



<P>adieus! How languid their conversation the last evening



<P>of their being together! In Edward's farewell there was no



<P>distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes



<P>of an affectionate brother to both.&nbsp; Twice did I leave



<P>them purposely together in the course of the last morning,



<P>and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out



<P>of the room.&nbsp; And Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward,



<P>cried not as I did.&nbsp; Even now her self-command is invariable.



<P>When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try



<P>to avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied



<P>in it?"

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room

of the park



<P>the next day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at



<P>the other, looking as good humoured and merry as before.



<P>She took them all most affectionately by the hand,



<P>and expressed great delight in seeing them again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so glad to see you!" said she, seating

herself



<P>between Elinor and Marianne, "for it is so bad a day I was



<P>afraid you might not come, which would be a shocking thing,



<P>as we go away again tomorrow. We must go, for the Westons



<P>come to us next week you know.&nbsp; It was quite a sudden thing



<P>our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the carriage



<P>was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I



<P>would go with him to Barton.&nbsp; He is so droll! He never



<P>tells me any thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer;



<P>however we shall meet again in town very soon, I hope."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were obliged to put an end to such an

expectation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not go to town!" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a

laugh,



<P>"I shall be quite disappointed if you do not.&nbsp; I could



<P>get the nicest house in world for you, next door to ours,



<P>in Hanover-square.&nbsp; You must come, indeed.&nbsp; I am sure



<P>I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till



<P>I am confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go



<P>into public."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They thanked her; but were obliged to resist

all



<P>her entreaties.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, my love," cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband,



<P>who just then entered the room--"you must help me to



<P>persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her love made no answer; and after slightly

bowing



<P>to the ladies, began complaining of the weather.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How horrid all this is!" said he.&nbsp; "Such

weather



<P>makes every thing and every body disgusting.&nbsp; Dullness



<P>is as much produced within doors as without, by rain.



<P>It makes one detest all one's acquaintance.&nbsp; What the



<P>devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room



<P>in his house?&nbsp; How few people know what comfort is!&nbsp; Sir



<P>John is as stupid as the weather."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest of the company soon dropt in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid, Miss Marianne," said Sir John,

"you have



<P>not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, don't be so sly before us," said Mrs.

Palmer;



<P>"for we know all about it, I assure you; and I admire your



<P>taste very much, for I think he is extremely handsome.



<P>We do not live a great way from him in the country, you know.



<P>Not above ten miles, I dare say."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Much nearer thirty," said her husband.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, well! there is not much difference.



<P>I never was at his house; but they say it is a sweet



<P>pretty place."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,"



<P>said Mr. Palmer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne remained perfectly silent, though

her



<P>countenance betrayed her interest in what was said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it very ugly?" continued Mrs. Palmer--"then

it



<P>must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they were seated in the dining room, Sir

John



<P>observed with regret that they were only eight all together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear," said he to his lady, "it is very

provoking



<P>that we should be so few.&nbsp; Why did not you ask the Gilberts



<P>to come to us today?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke

to me



<P>about it before, that it could not be done?&nbsp; They dined



<P>with us last."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You and I, Sir John," said Mrs. Jennings,



<P>"should not stand upon such ceremony."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you would be very ill-bred," cried Mr.

Palmer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My love you contradict every body," said his

wife



<P>with her usual laugh.&nbsp; "Do you know that you are quite rude?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did not know I contradicted any body in

calling



<P>your mother ill-bred."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ay, you may abuse me as you please," said

the good-natured



<P>old lady, "you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot



<P>give her back again.&nbsp; So there I have the whip hand of you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her



<P>husband could not get rid of her; and exultingly said,



<P>she did not care how cross he was to her, as they must



<P>live together.&nbsp; It was impossible for any one to be more



<P>thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy



<P>than Mrs. Palmer.&nbsp; The studied indifference, insolence,



<P>and discontent of her husband gave her no pain;



<P>and when he scolded or abused her, she was highly diverted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Palmer is so droll!" said she, in a whisper,



<P>to Elinor.&nbsp; "He is always out of humour."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation,



<P>to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly



<P>ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear.



<P>His temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding,



<P>like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable



<P>bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly



<P>woman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too



<P>common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.--



<P>It was rather a wish of distinction, she believed,



<P>which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body,



<P>and his general abuse of every thing before him.



<P>It was the desire of appearing superior to other people.



<P>The motive was too common to be wondered at; but the means,



<P>however they might succeed by establishing his superiority



<P>in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to him



<P>except his wife.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood," said Mrs. Palmer

soon afterwards,



<P>"I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister.



<P>Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this



<P>Christmas?&nbsp; Now, pray do,--and come while the Westons are



<P>with us.&nbsp; You cannot think how happy I shall be!&nbsp; It will



<P>be quite delightful!--My love," applying to her husband,



<P>"don't you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly," he replied, with a sneer--"I came



<P>into Devonshire with no other view."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There now,"--said his lady, "you see Mr. Palmer



<P>expects you; so you cannot refuse to come."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They both eagerly and resolutely declined her

invitation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But indeed you must and shall come.&nbsp;

I am sure you



<P>will like it of all things.&nbsp; The Westons will be with us,



<P>and it will be quite delightful.&nbsp; You cannot think



<P>what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay now,



<P>for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing



<P>against the election; and so many people came to dine



<P>with us that I never saw before, it is quite charming!&nbsp; But,



<P>poor fellow! it is very fatiguing to him! for he is forced



<P>to make every body like him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as

she



<P>assented to the hardship of such an obligation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How charming it will be," said Charlotte,

"when he



<P>is in Parliament!--won't it? How I shall laugh!&nbsp; It will



<P>be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him



<P>with an M.P.--But do you know, he says, he will never frank



<P>for me?&nbsp; He declares he won't.&nbsp; Don't you, Mr. Palmer?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He cannot bear writing, you know," she continued--



<P>"he says it is quite shocking."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," said he, "I never said any thing so irrational.



<P>Don't palm all your abuses of languages upon me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There now; you see how droll he is.&nbsp;

This is always



<P>the way with him!&nbsp; Sometimes he won't speak to me for half



<P>a day together, and then he comes out with something



<P>so droll--all about any thing in the world."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She surprised Elinor very much as they returned



<P>into the drawing-room, by asking her whether she did



<P>not like Mr. Palmer excessively.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly," said Elinor; "he seems very agreeable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well--I am so glad you do.&nbsp; I thought

you would,



<P>he is so pleasant; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased



<P>with you and your sisters I can tell you, and you can't



<P>think how disappointed he will be if you don't come



<P>to Cleveland.--I can't imagine why you should object



<P>to it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation;



<P>and by changing the subject, put a stop to her entreaties.



<P>She thought it probable that as they lived in the



<P>same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some



<P>more particular account of Willoughby's general



<P>character, than could be gathered from the Middletons'



<P>partial acquaintance with him; and she was eager to gain



<P>from any one, such a confirmation of his merits as might



<P>remove the possibility of fear from Marianne.&nbsp; She began



<P>by inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland,



<P>and whether they were intimately acquainted with him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,"



<P>replied Mrs. Palmer;--"Not that I ever spoke



<P>to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.



<P>Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton



<P>while he was at Allenham.&nbsp; Mama saw him here once before;--



<P>but I was with my uncle at Weymouth.&nbsp; However, I dare say



<P>we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire,



<P>if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never



<P>have been in the country together.&nbsp; He is very little



<P>at Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there,



<P>I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is



<P>in the opposition, you know, and besides it is such a



<P>way off.&nbsp; I know why you inquire about him, very well;



<P>your sister is to marry him.&nbsp; I am monstrous glad of it,



<P>for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my word," replied Elinor, "you know much



<P>more of the matter than I do, if you have any reason



<P>to expect such a match."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't pretend to deny it, because you know

it is



<P>what every body talks of.&nbsp; I assure you I heard of it



<P>in my way through town."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear Mrs. Palmer!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon



<P>Monday morning in Bond-street, just before we left town,



<P>and he told me of it directly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You surprise me very much.&nbsp; Colonel Brandon

tell



<P>you of it!&nbsp; Surely you must be mistaken.&nbsp; To give such



<P>intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it,



<P>even if it were true, is not what I should expect Colonel



<P>Brandon to do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I do assure you it was so, for all that,



<P>and I will tell you how it happened.&nbsp; When we met him,



<P>he turned back and walked with us; and so we began talking



<P>of my brother and sister, and one thing and another,



<P>and I said to him, 'So, Colonel, there is a new family



<P>come to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word



<P>they are very pretty, and that one of them is going to be



<P>married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna.&nbsp; Is it true,



<P>pray? for of course you must know, as you have been in



<P>Devonshire so lately.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what did the Colonel say?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as

if he



<P>knew it to be true, so from that moment I set it down



<P>as certain.&nbsp; It will be quite delightful, I declare!



<P>When is it to take place?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises,



<P>he did nothing but say fine things of you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am flattered by his commendation.&nbsp;

He seems



<P>an excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So do I.--He is such a charming man, that

it



<P>is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull.



<P>Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too.--



<P>I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he



<P>hardly ever falls in love with any body."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part



<P>of Somersetshire?" said Elinor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not

believe



<P>many people are acquainted with him, because Combe Magna



<P>is so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable



<P>I assure you.&nbsp; Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby



<P>wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.



<P>She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour;



<P>not but that he is much more lucky in getting her,



<P>because she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing



<P>can be good enough for her.&nbsp; However, I don't think



<P>her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you;



<P>for I think you both excessively pretty, and so does



<P>Mr. Palmer too I am sure, though we could not get him



<P>to own it last night."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer's information respecting Willoughby



<P>was not very material; but any testimony in his favour,



<P>however small, was pleasing to her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,"



<P>continued Charlotte.--"And now I hope we shall always be



<P>great friends.&nbsp; You can't think how much I longed to see you!



<P>It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage!



<P>Nothing can be like it, to be sure!&nbsp; And I am so glad



<P>your sister is going to be well married!&nbsp; I hope you will



<P>be a great deal at Combe Magna.&nbsp; It is a sweet place,



<P>by all accounts."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have been long acquainted with Colonel

Brandon,



<P>have not you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married.--



<P>He was a particular friend of Sir John's. I believe,"



<P>she added in a low voice, "he would have been very



<P>glad to have had me, if he could.&nbsp; Sir John and Lady



<P>Middleton wished it very much.&nbsp; But mama did not think



<P>the match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would



<P>have mentioned it to the Colonel, and we should have been



<P>married immediately."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John's

proposal



<P>to your mother before it was made?&nbsp; Had he never owned



<P>his affection to yourself?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it,



<P>I dare say he would have liked it of all things.



<P>He had not seen me then above twice, for it was before



<P>I left school.&nbsp; However, I am much happier as I am.



<P>Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in

her



<P>husband's judgment, that she waited the very next day



<P>both on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; and her



<P>confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,



<P>even the woman with whom her sisters were staying,



<P>by no means unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton,



<P>she found her one of the most charming women in the world!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs.

Dashwood.



<P>There was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides,



<P>which mutually attracted them; and they sympathised



<P>with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor,



<P>and a general want of understanding.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same manners, however, which recommended

Mrs. John



<P>Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit



<P>the fancy of Mrs. Jennings, and to HER she appeared nothing



<P>more than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address,



<P>who met her husband's sisters without any affection,



<P>and almost without having anything to say to them;



<P>for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street,



<P>she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor wanted very much to know, though she

did



<P>not chuse to ask, whether Edward was then in town;



<P>but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily



<P>to mention his name before her, till able to tell her



<P>that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on,



<P>or till her husband's expectations on Colonel Brandon



<P>were answered; because she believed them still so very



<P>much attached to each other, that they could not be too



<P>sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.



<P>The intelligence however, which SHE would not give,



<P>soon flowed from another quarter.&nbsp; Lucy came very shortly



<P>to claim Elinor's compassion on being unable to see Edward,



<P>though he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood.



<P>He dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings for fear



<P>of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet,



<P>was not to be told, they could do nothing at present



<P>but write.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward assured them himself of his being in

town,



<P>within a very short time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street.



<P>Twice was his card found on the table, when they returned



<P>from their morning's engagements.&nbsp; Elinor was pleased



<P>that he had called; and still more pleased that she had



<P>missed him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted



<P>with the Middletons, that, though not much in the habit



<P>of giving anything, they determined to give them--



<P>a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began,



<P>invited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had



<P>taken a very good house for three months.&nbsp; Their sisters



<P>and Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise, and John Dashwood



<P>was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who, always glad



<P>to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager



<P>civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.



<P>They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn



<P>whether her sons were to be of the party.&nbsp; The expectation



<P>of seeing HER, however, was enough to make her interested



<P>in the engagement; for though she could now meet Edward's



<P>mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised



<P>to attend such an introduction, though she could now see



<P>her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself,



<P>her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars,



<P>her curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interest with which she thus anticipated

the



<P>party, was soon afterwards increased, more powerfully



<P>than pleasantly, by her hearing that the Miss Steeles



<P>were also to be at it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So well had they recommended themselves to

Lady Middleton,



<P>so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her,



<P>that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant, and her



<P>sister not even genteel, she was as ready as Sir John



<P>to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street;



<P>and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss



<P>Steeles, as soon as the Dashwoods' invitation was known,



<P>that their visit should begin a few days before the party



<P>took place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood,



<P>as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had



<P>had the care of her brother, might not have done much,



<P>however, towards procuring them seats at her table;



<P>but as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy,



<P>who had long wanted to be personally known to the family,



<P>to have a nearer view of their characters and her own



<P>difficulties, and to have an opportunity of endeavouring



<P>to please them, had seldom been happier in her life,



<P>than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood's card.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Elinor its effect was very different.&nbsp;

She began



<P>immediately to determine, that Edward who lived with



<P>his mother, must be asked as his mother was, to a party



<P>given by his sister; and to see him for the first time,



<P>after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardly



<P>knew how she could bear it!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded



<P>entirely on reason, and certainly not at all on truth.



<P>They were relieved however, not by her own recollection,



<P>but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to be



<P>inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her



<P>that Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday,



<P>and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther



<P>by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme



<P>affection for herself, which he could not conceal when they



<P>were together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The important Tuesday came that was to introduce



<P>the two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!" said Lucy, as

they



<P>walked up the stairs together--for the Middletons arrived



<P>so directly after Mrs. Jennings, that they all followed



<P>the servant at the same time--"There is nobody here but



<P>you, that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand.



<P>Good gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all



<P>my happiness depends on--that is to be my mother!"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could have given her immediate relief



<P>by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother,



<P>rather than her own, whom they were about to behold;



<P>but instead of doing that, she assured her, and with



<P>great sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter



<P>amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself,



<P>hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright,



<P>even to formality, in her figure, and serious,



<P>even to sourness, in her aspect.&nbsp; Her complexion was sallow;



<P>and her features small, without beauty, and naturally



<P>without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow



<P>had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity,



<P>by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature.



<P>She was not a woman of many words; for, unlike people



<P>in general, she proportioned them to the number of



<P>her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her,



<P>not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed



<P>with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this

behaviour.--



<P>A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it



<P>was not in Mrs. Ferrars' power to distress her by it now;--



<P>and the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles,



<P>a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more,



<P>only amused her.&nbsp; She could not but smile to see the graciousness



<P>of both mother and daughter towards the very person--



<P>for Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others,



<P>had they known as much as she did, they would have been most



<P>anxious to mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively



<P>no power to wound them, sat pointedly slighted by both.



<P>But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied,



<P>she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from



<P>which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions



<P>with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance,



<P>without thoroughly despising them all four.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably



<P>distinguished; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teazed



<P>about Dr. Davis to be perfectly happy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dinner was a grand one, the servants were

numerous,



<P>and every thing bespoke the Mistress's inclination



<P>for show, and the Master's ability to support it.



<P>In spite of the improvements and additions which were



<P>making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner



<P>having once been within some thousand pounds of being



<P>obliged to sell out at a loss, nothing gave any symptom



<P>of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;--



<P>no poverty of any kind, except of conversation, appeared--



<P>but there, the deficiency was considerable.&nbsp; John Dashwood



<P>had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing,



<P>and his wife had still less.&nbsp; But there was no peculiar



<P>disgrace in this; for it was very much the case with



<P>the chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured



<P>under one or other of these disqualifications for being



<P>agreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want



<P>of elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room



<P>after dinner, this poverty was particularly evident,



<P>for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some



<P>variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land,



<P>and breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one



<P>subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in,



<P>which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood,



<P>and Lady Middleton's second son William, who were nearly



<P>of the same age.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had both the children been there, the affair

might



<P>have been determined too easily by measuring them at once;



<P>but as Harry only was present, it was all conjectural



<P>assertion on both sides; and every body had a right to



<P>be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it



<P>over and over again as often as they liked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parties stood thus:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two mothers, though each really convinced

that



<P>her own son was the tallest, politely decided in favour



<P>of the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two grandmothers, with not less partiality,



<P>but more sincerity, were equally earnest in support



<P>of their own descendant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please

one parent



<P>than the other, thought the boys were both remarkably tall



<P>for their age, and could not conceive that there could



<P>be the smallest difference in the world between them;



<P>and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it,



<P>as fast as she could, in favour of each.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, having once delivered her opinion on



<P>William's side, by which she offended Mrs. Ferrars and



<P>Fanny still more, did not see the necessity of enforcing



<P>it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when called



<P>on for her's, offended them all, by declaring that she



<P>had no opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had

painted



<P>a very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law,



<P>which being now just mounted and brought home,



<P>ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens,



<P>catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following



<P>the other gentlemen into the room, were officiously



<P>handed by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These are done by my eldest sister," said

he; "and you,



<P>as a man of taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them.



<P>I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any



<P>of her performances before, but she is in general reckoned



<P>to draw extremely well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions



<P>to connoisseurship, warmly admired the screens, as he



<P>would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood;



<P>and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited,



<P>they were handed round for general inspection.



<P>Mrs. Ferrars, not aware of their being Elinor's work,



<P>particularly requested to look at them; and after they had



<P>received gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons's approbation,



<P>Fanny presented them to her mother, considerately informing



<P>her, at the same time, that they were done by Miss Dashwood.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hum"--said Mrs. Ferrars--"very pretty,"--and

without



<P>regarding them at all, returned them to her daughter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her

mother



<P>had been quite rude enough,--for, colouring a little,



<P>she immediately said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are very pretty, ma'am--an't they?" But

then again,



<P>the dread of having been too civil, too encouraging herself,



<P>probably came over her, for she presently added,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you not think they are something in Miss



<P>Morton's style of painting, Ma'am?--She DOES paint most



<P>delightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beautifully indeed!&nbsp; But SHE does every

thing well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne could not bear this.--She was already



<P>greatly displeased with Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed



<P>praise of another, at Elinor's expense, though she



<P>had not any notion of what was principally meant by it,



<P>provoked her immediately to say with warmth,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is admiration of a very particular kind!--



<P>what is Miss Morton to us?--who knows, or who cares,



<P>for her?--it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so saying, she took the screens out of

her



<P>sister-in-law's hands, to admire them herself as they



<P>ought to be admired.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and

drawing



<P>herself up more stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort



<P>this bitter philippic, "Miss Morton is Lord Morton's daughter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband

was



<P>all in a fright at his sister's audacity.&nbsp; Elinor was



<P>much more hurt by Marianne's warmth than she had been



<P>by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as they



<P>were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only



<P>what was amiable in it, the affectionate heart which could



<P>not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's feelings did not stop here.&nbsp;

The cold



<P>insolence of Mrs. Ferrars's general behaviour to her sister,



<P>seemed, to her, to foretell such difficulties and distresses



<P>to Elinor, as her own wounded heart taught her to think



<P>of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of



<P>affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment,



<P>to her sister's chair, and putting one arm round her neck,



<P>and one cheek close to hers, said in a low, but eager,



<P>voice,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear, dear Elinor, don't mind them.&nbsp;

Don't let them



<P>make YOU unhappy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could say no more; her spirits were quite

overcome,



<P>and hiding her face on Elinor's shoulder, she burst



<P>into tears.&nbsp; Every body's attention was called, and almost



<P>every body was concerned.--Colonel Brandon rose up and went



<P>to them without knowing what he did.--Mrs. Jennings,



<P>with a very intelligent "Ah! poor dear," immediately gave



<P>her her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged



<P>against the author of this nervous distress, that he



<P>instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele,



<P>and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of the whole



<P>shocking affair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered



<P>enough to put an end to the bustle, and sit down among



<P>the rest; though her spirits retained the impression



<P>of what had passed, the whole evening.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor Marianne!" said her brother to Colonel

Brandon,



<P>in a low voice, as soon as he could secure his attention,--



<P>"She has not such good health as her sister,--she is very



<P>nervous,--she has not Elinor's constitution;--and one must



<P>allow that there is something very trying to a young woman



<P>who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions.



<P>You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS remarkably



<P>handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.--



<P>Now you see it is all gone."

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was

satisfied.--



<P>She had found in her every thing that could tend to make



<P>a farther connection between the families undesirable.--



<P>She had seen enough of her pride, her meanness, and her



<P>determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend all



<P>the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement,



<P>and retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been



<P>otherwise free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful



<P>for her OWN sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her



<P>from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars's creation,



<P>preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice, or any



<P>solicitude for her good opinion.&nbsp; Or at least, if she did not



<P>bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward's being fettered



<P>to Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable,



<P>she OUGHT to have rejoiced.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wondered that Lucy's spirits could be so

very much



<P>elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest



<P>and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make



<P>the attention which seemed only paid her because she was



<P>NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself--or to allow



<P>her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her,



<P>because her real situation was unknown.&nbsp; But that it was so,



<P>had not only been declared by Lucy's eyes at the time,



<P>but was declared over again the next morning more openly,



<P>for at her particular desire, Lady Middleton set her down



<P>in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone,



<P>to tell her how happy she was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chance proved a lucky one, for a message

from



<P>Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear friend," cried Lucy, as soon as they

were



<P>by themselves, "I come to talk to you of my happiness.



<P>Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars's way



<P>of treating me yesterday?&nbsp; So exceeding affable as she



<P>was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;--



<P>but the very moment I was introduced, there was such an



<P>affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say,



<P>she had quite took a fancy to me.&nbsp; Now was not it so?--



<P>You saw it all; and was not you quite struck with it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She was certainly very civil to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?--



<P>I saw a vast deal more.&nbsp; Such kindness as fell to the share



<P>of nobody but me!--No pride, no hauteur, and your sister



<P>just the same--all sweetness and affability!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor wished to talk of something else, but

Lucy still



<P>pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness;



<P>and Elinor was obliged to go on.--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,"



<P>said she, "nothing could be more flattering than their



<P>treatment of you;--but as that was not the case"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I guessed you would say so"--replied Lucy



<P>quickly--"but there was no reason in the world why



<P>Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she did not,



<P>and her liking me is every thing.&nbsp; You shan't talk me



<P>out of my satisfaction.&nbsp; I am sure it will all end well,



<P>and there will be no difficulties at all, to what I



<P>used to think.&nbsp; Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman,



<P>and so is your sister.&nbsp; They are both delightful women,



<P>indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable



<P>Mrs. Dashwood was!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did

not



<P>attempt any.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you seem low--you



<P>don't speak;--sure you an't well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never was in better health."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am glad of it with all my heart; but really

you did



<P>not look it.&nbsp; I should be sorry to have YOU ill; you, that have



<P>been the greatest comfort to me in the world!--Heaven



<P>knows what I should have done without your friendship."--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though

doubting



<P>her own success.&nbsp; But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she



<P>directly replied,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard



<P>for me, and next to Edward's love, it is the greatest



<P>comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one



<P>good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty often,



<P>for Lady Middleton's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood,



<P>so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say,



<P>and Edward spends half his time with his sister--besides,



<P>Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;--



<P>and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say



<P>more than once, they should always be glad to see me.--



<P>They are such charming women!--I am sure if ever you



<P>tell your sister what I think of her, you cannot speak



<P>too high."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Elinor would not give her any encouragement



<P>to hope that she SHOULD tell her sister.&nbsp; Lucy continued.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sure I should have seen it in a moment,



<P>if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me.&nbsp; If she had only



<P>made me a formal courtesy, for instance, without saying



<P>a word, and never after had took any notice of me,



<P>and never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know



<P>what I mean--if I had been treated in that forbidding



<P>sort of way, I should have gave it all up in despair.



<P>I could not have stood it.&nbsp; For where she DOES dislike,



<P>I know it is most violent."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was prevented from making any reply

to this



<P>civil triumph, by the door's being thrown open, the servant's



<P>announcing Mr. Ferrars, and Edward's immediately walking in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance

of each



<P>shewed that it was so.&nbsp; They all looked exceedingly foolish;



<P>and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk



<P>out of the room again, as to advance farther into it.



<P>The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest form,



<P>which they would each have been most anxious to avoid,



<P>had fallen on them.--They were not only all three together,



<P>but were together without the relief of any other person.



<P>The ladies recovered themselves first.&nbsp; It was not Lucy's



<P>business to put herself forward, and the appearance of



<P>secrecy must still be kept up.&nbsp; She could therefore only



<P>LOOK her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him,



<P>said no more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was

she,



<P>for his sake and her own, to do it well, that she



<P>forced herself, after a moment's recollection,



<P>to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost easy,



<P>and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still



<P>improved them.&nbsp; She would not allow the presence of Lucy,



<P>nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself,



<P>to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him,



<P>and that she had very much regretted being from home,



<P>when he called before in Berkeley Street.&nbsp; She would



<P>not be frightened from paying him those attentions which,



<P>as a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the



<P>observant eyes of Lucy, though she soon perceived them



<P>to be narrowly watching her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward,

and he



<P>had courage enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still



<P>exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion, which the case



<P>rendered reasonable, though his sex might make it rare;



<P>for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy's, nor



<P>could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed

determined



<P>to make no contribution to the comfort of the others,



<P>and would not say a word; and almost every thing that WAS



<P>said, proceeded from Elinor, who was obliged to volunteer



<P>all the information about her mother's health, their coming



<P>to town, &amp;c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,



<P>but never did.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon



<P>afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as



<P>to determine, under pretence of fetching Marianne,



<P>to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it,



<P>and THAT in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away



<P>several minutes on the landing-place, with the most



<P>high-minded fortitude, before she went to her sister.



<P>When that was once done, however, it was time for the raptures



<P>of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurried her into



<P>the drawing-room immediately.&nbsp; Her pleasure in seeing him



<P>was like every other of her feelings, strong in itself,



<P>and strongly spoken.&nbsp; She met him with a hand that would



<P>be taken, and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear Edward!" she cried, "this is a moment

of great



<P>happiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved,



<P>but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he



<P>really felt.&nbsp; Again they all sat down, and for a moment



<P>or two all were silent; while Marianne was looking with the



<P>most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and sometimes



<P>at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each



<P>other should be checked by Lucy's unwelcome presence.



<P>Edward was the first to speak, and it was to notice



<P>Marianne's altered looks, and express his fear of her



<P>not finding London agree with her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, don't think of me!" she replied with spirited



<P>earnestness, though her eyes were filled with tears



<P>as she spoke, "don't think of MY health.&nbsp; Elinor is well,



<P>you see.&nbsp; That must be enough for us both."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This remark was not calculated to make Edward

or



<P>Elinor more easy, nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy,



<P>who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you like London?" said Edward, willing

to say



<P>any thing that might introduce another subject.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not at all.&nbsp; I expected much pleasure

in it,



<P>but I have found none.&nbsp; The sight of you, Edward, is the



<P>only comfort it has afforded; and thank Heaven! you



<P>are what you always were!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused--no one spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think, Elinor," she presently added, "we

must



<P>employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton.



<P>In a week or two, I suppose, we shall be going; and, I trust,



<P>Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Edward muttered something, but what it

was,



<P>nobody knew, not even himself.&nbsp; But Marianne, who saw



<P>his agitation, and could easily trace it to whatever



<P>cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied,



<P>and soon talked of something else.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street



<P>yesterday!&nbsp; So dull, so wretchedly dull!--But I have much



<P>to say to you on that head, which cannot be said now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with this admirable discretion did she

defer



<P>the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more



<P>disagreeable than ever, and of her being particularly



<P>disgusted with his mother, till they were more in private.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why were you not there, Edward?--Why did

you



<P>not come?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was engaged elsewhere."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Engaged!&nbsp; But what was that, when such

friends



<P>were to be met?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps, Miss Marianne," cried Lucy, eager

to take



<P>some revenge on her, "you think young men never stand



<P>upon engagements, if they have no mind to keep them,



<P>little as well as great."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed

entirely



<P>insensible of the sting; for she calmly replied,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I

am very



<P>sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street.



<P>And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience



<P>in the world; the most scrupulous in performing



<P>every engagement, however minute, and however it



<P>may make against his interest or pleasure.&nbsp; He is the



<P>most fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation,



<P>and the most incapable of being selfish, of any body



<P>I ever saw.&nbsp; Edward, it is so, and I will say it.



<P>What! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you



<P>must be no friend of mine; for those who will accept



<P>of my love and esteem, must submit to my open commendation."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nature of her commendation, in the present

case,



<P>however, happened to be particularly ill-suited to the



<P>feelings of two thirds of her auditors, and was so very



<P>unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon got up to go away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going so soon!" said Marianne; "my dear Edward,



<P>this must not be."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And drawing him a little aside, she whispered



<P>her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer.



<P>But even this encouragement failed, for he would go;



<P>and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted



<P>two hours, soon afterwards went away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can bring her here so often?" said Marianne,



<P>on her leaving them.&nbsp; "Could not she see that we wanted



<P>her gone!--how teazing to Edward!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy

has been



<P>the longest known to him of any.&nbsp; It is but natural



<P>that he should like to see her as well as ourselves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne looked at her steadily, and said,

"You know,



<P>Elinor, that this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear.



<P>If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted,



<P>as I must suppose to be the case, you ought to recollect



<P>that I am the last person in the world to do it.



<P>I cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are



<P>not really wanted."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She then left the room; and Elinor dared not

follow



<P>her to say more, for bound as she was by her promise



<P>of secrecy to Lucy, she could give no information that



<P>would convince Marianne; and painful as the consequences



<P>of her still continuing in an error might be, she was



<P>obliged to submit to it.&nbsp; All that she could hope, was



<P>that Edward would not often expose her or himself to the



<P>distress of hearing Marianne's mistaken warmth, nor to the



<P>repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended



<P>their recent meeting--and this she had every reason to expect.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next

day,



<P>and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain



<P>each other.&nbsp; But this did not last long; Elinor had hardly



<P>got their last visitors out of her head, had hardly done



<P>wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause,



<P>at Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities,



<P>and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between



<P>husband and wife, before Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings's



<P>active zeal in the cause of society, procured her some



<P>other new acquaintance to see and observe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had

met with



<P>two young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction



<P>of discovering to be her relations, and this was enough



<P>for Sir John to invite them directly to the park,



<P>as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.



<P>Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before



<P>such an invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into



<P>no little alarm on the return of Sir John, by hearing



<P>that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls



<P>whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose elegance,--



<P>whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof;



<P>for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject



<P>went for nothing at all.&nbsp; Their being her relations too



<P>made it so much the worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts



<P>at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded,



<P>when she advised her daughter not to care about their being



<P>so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put



<P>up with one another.&nbsp; As it was impossible, however, now to



<P>prevent their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the



<P>idea of it, with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman,



<P>contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle



<P>reprimand on the subject five or six times every day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young ladies arrived: their appearance

was by



<P>no means ungenteel or unfashionable.&nbsp; Their dress was



<P>very smart, their manners very civil, they were delighted



<P>with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,



<P>and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children



<P>that Lady Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their



<P>favour before they had been an hour at the Park.



<P>She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed,



<P>which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.



<P>Sir John's confidence in his own judgment rose with this



<P>animated praise, and he set off directly for the cottage



<P>to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles' arrival,



<P>and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls



<P>in the world.&nbsp; From such commendation as this, however,



<P>there was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew



<P>that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met



<P>with in every part of England, under every possible



<P>variation of form, face, temper and understanding.



<P>Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly



<P>and look at his guests.&nbsp; Benevolent, philanthropic man!&nbsp; It



<P>was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do come now," said he--"pray come--you must

come--I



<P>declare you shall come--You can't think how you will



<P>like them.&nbsp; Lucy is monstrous pretty, and so good humoured



<P>and agreeable!&nbsp; The children are all hanging about her already,



<P>as if she was an old acquaintance.&nbsp; And they both long



<P>to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter



<P>that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world;



<P>and I have told them it is all very true, and a great



<P>deal more.&nbsp; You will be delighted with them I am sure.



<P>They have brought the whole coach full of playthings



<P>for the children.&nbsp; How can you be so cross as not to come?



<P>Why they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion.



<P>YOU are my cousins, and they are my wife's, so you must



<P>be related."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Sir John could not prevail.&nbsp; He could

only obtain



<P>a promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two,



<P>and then left them in amazement at their indifference,



<P>to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the



<P>Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the Miss



<P>Steeles to them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When their promised visit to the Park and consequent



<P>introduction to these young ladies took place, they found



<P>in the appearance of the eldest, who was nearly thirty,



<P>with a very plain and not a sensible face, nothing to admire;



<P>but in the other, who was not more than two or three



<P>and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her



<P>features were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye,



<P>and a smartness of air, which though it did not give



<P>actual elegance or grace, gave distinction to her person.--



<P>Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon



<P>allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she



<P>saw with what constant and judicious attention they



<P>were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton.



<P>With her children they were in continual raptures,



<P>extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring



<P>their whims; and such of their time as could be spared from



<P>the importunate demands which this politeness made on it,



<P>was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing,



<P>if she happened to be doing any thing, or in taking patterns



<P>of some elegant new dress, in which her appearance



<P>the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.



<P>Fortunately for those who pay their court through



<P>such foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise



<P>for her children, the most rapacious of human beings,



<P>is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant;



<P>but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive



<P>affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards



<P>her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton



<P>without the smallest surprise or distrust.&nbsp; She saw with



<P>maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments



<P>and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.



<P>She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about



<P>their ears, their work-bags searched, and their knives



<P>and scissors stolen away, and felt no doubt of its being



<P>a reciprocal enjoyment.&nbsp; It suggested no other surprise



<P>than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,



<P>without claiming a share in what was passing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "John is in such spirits today!" said she,

on his



<P>taking Miss Steeles's pocket handkerchief, and throwing



<P>it out of window--"He is full of monkey tricks."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And soon afterwards, on the second boy's violently



<P>pinching one of the same lady's fingers, she fondly observed,



<P>"How playful William is!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And here is my sweet little Annamaria," she

added,



<P>tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old,



<P>who had not made a noise for the last two minutes;



<P>"And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was there



<P>such a quiet little thing!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces,



<P>a pin in her ladyship's head dress slightly scratching



<P>the child's neck, produced from this pattern of gentleness



<P>such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone by any



<P>creature professedly noisy.&nbsp; The mother's consternation



<P>was excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the



<P>Miss Steeles, and every thing was done by all three,



<P>in so critical an emergency, which affection could suggest



<P>as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer.



<P>She was seated in her mother's lap, covered with kisses,



<P>her wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the



<P>Miss Steeles, who was on her knees to attend her,



<P>and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other.



<P>With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise



<P>to cease crying.&nbsp; She still screamed and sobbed lustily,



<P>kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her, and all



<P>their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton



<P>luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress



<P>last week, some apricot marmalade had been successfully



<P>applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly



<P>proposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight



<P>intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it,



<P>gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.--



<P>She was carried out of the room therefore in her



<P>mother's arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the



<P>two boys chose to follow, though earnestly entreated



<P>by their mother to stay behind, the four young ladies



<P>were left in a quietness which the room had not known for



<P>many hours.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor little creatures!" said Miss Steele,

as soon



<P>as they were gone.&nbsp; "It might have been a very sad accident."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yet I hardly know how," cried Marianne, "unless

it



<P>had been under totally different circumstances.



<P>But this is the usual way of heightening alarm, where there



<P>is nothing to be alarmed at in reality."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!" said

Lucy Steele.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was silent; it was impossible for

her to say



<P>what she did not feel, however trivial the occasion;



<P>and upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies



<P>when politeness required it, always fell.&nbsp; She did her



<P>best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton



<P>with more warmth than she felt, though with far less than



<P>Miss Lucy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And Sir John too," cried the elder sister,



<P>"what a charming man he is!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here too, Miss Dashwood's commendation, being

only



<P>simple and just, came in without any eclat.&nbsp; She merely



<P>observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what a charming little family they have!&nbsp;

I



<P>never saw such fine children in my life.--I declare I



<P>quite doat upon them already, and indeed I am always



<P>distractedly fond of children."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should guess so," said Elinor, with a smile,



<P>"from what I have witnessed this morning."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a notion," said Lucy, "you think the

little



<P>Middletons rather too much indulged; perhaps they may be the



<P>outside of enough; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton;



<P>and for my part, I love to see children full of life



<P>and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I confess," replied Elinor, "that while I

am at



<P>Barton Park, I never think of tame and quiet children



<P>with any abhorrence."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short pause succeeded this speech, which

was first



<P>broken by Miss Steele, who seemed very much disposed



<P>for conversation, and who now said rather abruptly,



<P>"And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?&nbsp; I suppose



<P>you were very sorry to leave Sussex."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some surprise at the familiarity of this

question,



<P>or at least of the manner in which it was spoken,



<P>Elinor replied that she was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is

not it?"



<P>added Miss Steele.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,"



<P>said Lucy, who seemed to think some apology necessary



<P>for the freedom of her sister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think every one MUST admire it," replied

Elinor,



<P>"who ever saw the place; though it is not to be supposed



<P>that any one can estimate its beauties as we do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And had you a great many smart beaux there?&nbsp;

I



<P>suppose you have not so many in this part of the world;



<P>for my part, I think they are a vast addition always."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why should you think," said Lucy, looking

ashamed



<P>of her sister, "that there are not as many genteel young



<P>men in Devonshire as Sussex?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nay, my dear, I'm sure I don't pretend to

say that there



<P>an't.&nbsp; I'm sure there's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter;



<P>but you know, how could I tell what smart beaux there



<P>might be about Norland; and I was only afraid the Miss



<P>Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not



<P>so many as they used to have.&nbsp; But perhaps you young ladies



<P>may not care about the beaux, and had as lief be without



<P>them as with them.&nbsp; For my part, I think they are vastly



<P>agreeable, provided they dress smart and behave civil.



<P>But I can't bear to see them dirty and nasty.&nbsp; Now there's



<P>Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man,



<P>quite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you



<P>do but meet him of a morning, he is not fit to be seen.--



<P>I suppose your brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood,



<P>before he married, as he was so rich?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my word," replied Elinor, "I cannot tell

you,



<P>for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.



<P>But this I can say, that if he ever was a beau before



<P>he married, he is one still for there is not the smallest



<P>alteration in him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men's

being



<P>beaux--they have something else to do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord! Anne," cried her sister, "you can talk

of



<P>nothing but beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you



<P>think of nothing else." And then to turn the discourse,



<P>she began admiring the house and the furniture.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough.



<P>The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left



<P>her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not blinded



<P>by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest,



<P>to her want of real elegance and artlessness, she left



<P>the house without any wish of knowing them better.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter,

well



<P>provided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton,



<P>his family, and all his relations, and no niggardly



<P>proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins, whom they



<P>declared to be the most beautiful, elegant, accomplished,



<P>and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom



<P>they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.--



<P>And to be better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found



<P>was their inevitable lot, for as Sir John was entirely



<P>on the side of the Miss Steeles, their party would be



<P>too strong for opposition, and that kind of intimacy



<P>must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour



<P>or two together in the same room almost every day.



<P>Sir John could do no more; but he did not know that any



<P>more was required: to be together was, in his opinion,



<P>to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their



<P>meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being



<P>established friends.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do him justice, he did every thing in his

power



<P>to promote their unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles



<P>acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins'



<P>situations in the most delicate particulars,--and Elinor



<P>had not seen them more than twice, before the eldest of



<P>them wished her joy on her sister's having been so lucky



<P>as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she



<P>came to Barton.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Twill be a fine thing to have her married

so young



<P>to be sure," said she, "and I hear he is quite a beau,



<P>and prodigious handsome.&nbsp; And I hope you may have as good



<P>luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend



<P>in the corner already."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would

be more



<P>nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward,



<P>than he had been with respect to Marianne; indeed it was



<P>rather his favourite joke of the two, as being somewhat



<P>newer and more conjectural; and since Edward's visit,



<P>they had never dined together without his drinking to her



<P>best affections with so much significancy and so many nods



<P>and winks, as to excite general attention.&nbsp; The letter F--



<P>had been likewise invariably brought forward, and found



<P>productive of such countless jokes, that its character



<P>as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long



<P>established with Elinor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now

all the



<P>benefit of these jokes, and in the eldest of them they



<P>raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman



<P>alluded to, which, though often impertinently expressed,



<P>was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness



<P>into the concerns of their family.&nbsp; But Sir John did not



<P>sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise,



<P>for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name,



<P>as Miss Steele had in hearing it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His name is Ferrars," said he, in a very audible

whisper;



<P>"but pray do not tell it, for it's a great secret."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ferrars!" repeated Miss Steele; "Mr. Ferrars

is



<P>the happy man, is he? What! your sister-in-law's brother,



<P>Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable young man to be sure;



<P>I know him very well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can you say so, Anne?" cried Lucy, who

generally



<P>made an amendment to all her sister's assertions.



<P>"Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle's, it



<P>is rather too much to pretend to know him very well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise.



<P>"And who was this uncle?&nbsp; Where did he live?&nbsp; How came



<P>they acquainted?"&nbsp; She wished very much to have the subject



<P>continued, though she did not chuse to join in it herself;



<P>but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time



<P>in her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either



<P>in curiosity after petty information, or in a disposition



<P>to communicate it.&nbsp; The manner in which Miss Steele had



<P>spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; for it struck



<P>her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion



<P>of that lady's knowing, or fancying herself to know something



<P>to his disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing,



<P>for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by



<P>Miss Steele when alluded to, or even openly mentioned by Sir John.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with

tolerable



<P>comfort to themselves.&nbsp; The house and the garden, with all



<P>the objects surrounding them, were now become familiar,



<P>and the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland



<P>half its charms were engaged in again with far greater



<P>enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the



<P>loss of their father.&nbsp; Sir John Middleton, who called



<P>on them every day for the first fortnight, and who was



<P>not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home,



<P>could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their visitors, except those from Barton Park,



<P>were not many; for, in spite of Sir John's urgent entreaties



<P>that they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated



<P>assurances of his carriage being always at their service,



<P>the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the



<P>wish of society for her children; and she was resolute



<P>in declining to visit any family beyond the distance



<P>of a walk.&nbsp; There were but few who could be so classed;



<P>and it was not all of them that were attainable.



<P>About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow



<P>winding valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton,



<P>as formerly described, the girls had, in one of their



<P>earliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking



<P>mansion which, by reminding them a little of Norland,



<P>interested their imagination and made them wish to be



<P>better acquainted with it.&nbsp; But they learnt, on enquiry,



<P>that its possessor, an elderly lady of very good character,



<P>was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world,



<P>and never stirred from home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole country about them abounded in beautiful

walks.



<P>The high downs which invited them from almost every window



<P>of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air



<P>on their summits, were a happy alternative when the dirt



<P>of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties;



<P>and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret



<P>one memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the



<P>partial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear



<P>the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding



<P>days had occasioned.&nbsp; The weather was not tempting enough



<P>to draw the two others from their pencil and their book,



<P>in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would



<P>be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would



<P>be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in

their own



<P>penetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they



<P>caught in their faces the animating gales of a high



<P>south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented



<P>their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a felicity in the world," said Marianne,



<P>"superior to this?--Margaret, we will walk here at least



<P>two hours."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way

against



<P>the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about



<P>twenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over



<P>their heads, and a driving rain set full in their face.--



<P>Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly,



<P>to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own house.



<P>One consolation however remained for them, to which the



<P>exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety;



<P>it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep



<P>side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They set off.&nbsp; Marianne had at first the

advantage,



<P>but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground;



<P>and Margaret, unable to stop herself to assist her,



<P>was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the bottom



<P>in safety.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers



<P>playing round him, was passing up the hill and within



<P>a few yards of Marianne, when her accident happened.



<P>He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.&nbsp; She had



<P>raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been



<P>twisted in her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.



<P>The gentleman offered his services; and perceiving that her



<P>modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary,



<P>took her up in his arms without farther delay, and carried



<P>her down the hill.&nbsp; Then passing through the garden,



<P>the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her



<P>directly into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived,



<P>and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair



<P>in the parlour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement

at



<P>their entrance, and while the eyes of both were fixed



<P>on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration



<P>which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized



<P>for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner



<P>so frank and so graceful that his person, which was



<P>uncommonly handsome, received additional charms from his voice



<P>and expression.&nbsp; Had he been even old, ugly, and vulgar,



<P>the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would



<P>have been secured by any act of attention to her child;



<P>but the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance,



<P>gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She thanked him again and again; and, with

a sweetness



<P>of address which always attended her, invited him to



<P>be seated.&nbsp; But this he declined, as he was dirty and wet.



<P>Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged.



<P>His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present



<P>home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would



<P>allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire



<P>after Miss Dashwood.&nbsp; The honour was readily granted,



<P>and he then departed, to make himself still more interesting,



<P>in the midst of an heavy rain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness



<P>were instantly the theme of general admiration,



<P>and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne



<P>received particular spirit from his exterior attractions.--



<P>Marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest,



<P>for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his



<P>lifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding



<P>him after their entering the house.&nbsp; But she had seen



<P>enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others,



<P>and with an energy which always adorned her praise.



<P>His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever



<P>drawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying



<P>her into the house with so little previous formality, there



<P>was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended



<P>the action to her.&nbsp; Every circumstance belonging to him



<P>was interesting.&nbsp; His name was good, his residence was in



<P>their favourite village, and she soon found out that of all



<P>manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.



<P>Her imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant,



<P>and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir John called on them as soon as the next

interval



<P>of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out



<P>of doors; and Marianne's accident being related to him,



<P>he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman



<P>of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Willoughby!" cried Sir John; "what, is HE



<P>in the country? That is good news however; I will



<P>ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on Thursday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know him then," said Mrs. Dashwood.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know him! to be sure I do.&nbsp; Why, he is

down here



<P>every year."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what sort of a young man is he?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I

assure you.



<P>A very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider



<P>in England."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And is that all you can say for him?" cried

Marianne,



<P>indignantly.&nbsp; "But what are his manners on more intimate



<P>acquaintance? What his pursuits, his talents, and genius?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir John was rather puzzled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my soul," said he, "I do not know much

about him



<P>as to all THAT.&nbsp; But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow,



<P>and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer



<P>I ever saw.&nbsp; Was she out with him today?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to

the



<P>colour of Mr. Willoughby's pointer, than he could



<P>describe to her the shades of his mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But who is he?" said Elinor.&nbsp; "Where

does he come



<P>from?&nbsp; Has he a house at Allenham?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this point Sir John could give more certain

intelligence;



<P>and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property



<P>of his own in the country; that he resided there only



<P>while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court,



<P>to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was



<P>to inherit; adding, "Yes, yes, he is very well worth



<P>catching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty



<P>little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides;



<P>and if I were you, I would not give him up to my



<P>younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.



<P>Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.



<P>Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not believe," said Mrs. Dashwood, with

a



<P>good humoured smile, "that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded



<P>by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what



<P>you call CATCHING him.&nbsp; It is not an employment to which



<P>they have been brought up.&nbsp; Men are very safe with us,



<P>let them be ever so rich.&nbsp; I am glad to find, however,



<P>from what you say, that he is a respectable young man,



<P>and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe,



<P>as ever lived," repeated Sir John.&nbsp; "I remember



<P>last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced



<P>from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did he indeed?" cried Marianne with sparkling

eyes,



<P>"and with elegance, with spirit?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride

to covert."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is what I like; that is what a young

man ought



<P>to be.&nbsp; Whatever be his pursuits, his eagerness in them



<P>should know no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatigue."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye, aye, I see how it will be," said Sir

John, "I see



<P>how it will be.&nbsp; You will be setting your cap at him now,



<P>and never think of poor Brandon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is an expression, Sir John," said Marianne,



<P>warmly, "which I particularly dislike.&nbsp; I abhor every



<P>common-place phrase by which wit is intended; and 'setting



<P>one's cap at a man,' or 'making a conquest,' are the most



<P>odious of all.&nbsp; Their tendency is gross and illiberal;



<P>and if their construction could ever be deemed clever,



<P>time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir John did not much understand this reproof;



<P>but he laughed as heartily as if he did, and then replied,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare

say,



<P>one way or other.&nbsp; Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already,



<P>and he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can



<P>tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining



<P>of ankles."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight,



<P>that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up



<P>the whole of her time to her; and, contenting herself with



<P>visiting her once or twice a day, returned from that period



<P>to her own home, and her own habits, in which she found



<P>the Miss Dashwoods very ready to ressume their former share.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About the third or fourth morning after their



<P>being thus resettled in Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings,



<P>on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer,



<P>entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting



<P>by herself, with an air of such hurrying importance



<P>as prepared her to hear something wonderful; and giving her



<P>time only to form that idea, began directly to justify it,



<P>by saying,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard

the news?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, ma'am.&nbsp; What is it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Something so strange!&nbsp; But you shall

hear it all.--



<P>When I got to Mr. Palmer's, I found Charlotte quite



<P>in a fuss about the child.&nbsp; She was sure it was very



<P>ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.



<P>So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord! my dear,'



<P>says I, 'it is nothing in the world, but the red gum--'



<P>and nurse said just the same.&nbsp; But Charlotte, she would



<P>not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for; and luckily



<P>he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he



<P>stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child,



<P>be said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world



<P>but the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy.&nbsp; And so,



<P>just as he was going away again, it came into my head,



<P>I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it,



<P>but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news.



<P>So upon that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave,



<P>and seemed to know something or other, and at last he



<P>said in a whisper, 'For fear any unpleasant report



<P>should reach the young ladies under your care as to their



<P>sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say,



<P>that I believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope



<P>Mrs. Dashwood will do very well.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What! is Fanny ill?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is exactly what I said, my dear.&nbsp;

'Lord!' says I,



<P>'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and the



<P>long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn,



<P>seems to be this.&nbsp; Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young



<P>man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it



<P>turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing



<P>in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged



<P>above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There's for you,



<P>my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter,



<P>except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?--



<P>There is no great wonder in their liking one another;



<P>but that matters should be brought so forward between them,



<P>and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened



<P>to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it



<P>out directly.&nbsp; Well, and so this was kept a great secret,



<P>for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your



<P>brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--



<P>till this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a



<P>well-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out.



<P>'Lord!' thinks she to herself, 'they are all so fond



<P>of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;'



<P>and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all



<P>alone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to



<P>come--for she had just been saying to your brother, only five



<P>minutes before, that she thought to make a match between



<P>Edward and some Lord's daughter or other, I forget who.



<P>So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity



<P>and pride.&nbsp; She fell into violent hysterics immediately,



<P>with such screams as reached your brother's ears,



<P>as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs,



<P>thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country.



<P>So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place,



<P>for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming



<P>what was going on.&nbsp; Poor soul!&nbsp; I pity HER.&nbsp; And I must

say,



<P>I think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded



<P>like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit.



<P>Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly;



<P>and your brother, he walked about the room, and said



<P>he did not know what to do.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood declared



<P>they should not stay a minute longer in the house,



<P>and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too,



<P>to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed



<P>up their clothes.&nbsp; THEN she fell into hysterics again,



<P>and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,



<P>and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar.



<P>The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor



<P>cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he



<P>came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says,



<P>she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad.



<P>I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope,



<P>with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her.



<P>Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he



<P>hears of it!&nbsp; To have his love used so scornfully! for



<P>they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may.



<P>I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest



<P>passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.&nbsp; He and I



<P>had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is,



<P>that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may



<P>be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she



<P>was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house,



<P>for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too;



<P>and so she may, for what I care.&nbsp; I have no pity for



<P>either of them.&nbsp; I have no notion of people's making



<P>such a to-do about money and greatness.&nbsp; There is no



<P>reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry;



<P>for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well



<P>by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself,



<P>she knows better than any body how to make the most



<P>of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only



<P>allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good



<P>an appearance with it as any body else would with eight.



<P>Lord! how snug they might live in such another cottage



<P>as yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and two men;



<P>and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my



<P>Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them



<P>exactly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had

had



<P>time enough to collect her thoughts, she was able



<P>to give such an answer, and make such observations,



<P>as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.



<P>Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary



<P>interest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late



<P>often hoped might be the case) had ceased to imagine her



<P>at all attached to Edward; and happy above all the rest,



<P>in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able



<P>to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to



<P>give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality



<P>on the conduct of every one concerned in it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could hardly determine what her own expectation



<P>of its event really was; though she earnestly tried



<P>to drive away the notion of its being possible to end



<P>otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy.



<P>What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could



<P>not be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear;



<P>and still more anxious to know how Edward would



<P>conduct himself.&nbsp; For HIM she felt much compassion;--



<P>for Lucy very little--and it cost her some pains to procure



<P>that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject,



<P>Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for



<P>its discussion.&nbsp; No time was to be lost in undeceiving her,



<P>in making her acquainted with the real truth, and in



<P>endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,



<P>without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister,



<P>or any resentment against Edward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's office was a painful one.--She was

going



<P>to remove what she really believed to be her sister's



<P>chief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she



<P>feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and



<P>to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,



<P>which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own



<P>disappointment over again.&nbsp; But unwelcome as such a task



<P>must be, it was necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore



<P>hastened to perform it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was very far from wishing to dwell on her

own



<P>feelings, or to represent herself as suffering much,



<P>any otherwise than as the self-command she had practised



<P>since her first knowledge of Edward's engagement, might



<P>suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.



<P>Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could



<P>not be given without emotion, it was not accompanied



<P>by violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged



<P>rather to the hearer, for Marianne listened with horror,



<P>and cried excessively.&nbsp; Elinor was to be the comforter



<P>of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs;



<P>and all the comfort that could be given by assurances



<P>of her own composure of mind, and a very earnest



<P>vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence,



<P>was readily offered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Marianne for some time would give credit

to neither.



<P>Edward seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowledging



<P>as Elinor did, that she HAD loved him most sincerely,



<P>could she feel less than herself!&nbsp; As for Lucy Steele,



<P>she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely



<P>incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could



<P>not be persuaded at first to believe, and afterwards



<P>to pardon, any former affection of Edward for her.



<P>She would not even admit it to have been natural;



<P>and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so,



<P>by that which only could convince her, a better knowledge



<P>of mankind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her first communication had reached no farther

than



<P>to state the fact of the engagement, and the length of time



<P>it had existed.--Marianne's feelings had then broken in,



<P>and put an end to all regularity of detail; and for some



<P>time all that could be done was to soothe her distress,



<P>lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.&nbsp; The first



<P>question on her side, which led to farther particulars,



<P>was,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long has this been known to you, Elinor?

has



<P>he written to you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have known it these four months.&nbsp; When

Lucy



<P>first came to Barton Park last November, she told me



<P>in confidence of her engagement."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the

astonishment



<P>which her lips could not utter.&nbsp; After a pause of wonder,



<P>she exclaimed--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Four months!--Have you known of this four

months?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor confirmed it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What!--while attending me in all my misery,

has this



<P>been on your heart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was not fit that you should then know how

much



<P>I was the reverse!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Four months!"--cried Marianne again.--"So

calm!--



<P>so cheerful!--how have you been supported?"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise

to



<P>Lucy, obliged me to be secret.&nbsp; I owed it to her, therefore,



<P>to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my



<P>family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me,



<P>which it could not be in my power to satisfy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne seemed much struck.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have very often wished to undeceive yourself

and my



<P>mother," added Elinor; "and once or twice I have attempted it;--



<P>but without betraying my trust, I never could have convinced you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Four months!--and yet you loved him!"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while

the comfort



<P>of others was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing



<P>how much I felt.&nbsp; Now, I can think and speak of it with



<P>little emotion.&nbsp; I would not have you suffer on my account;



<P>for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself.



<P>I have many things to support me.&nbsp; I am not conscious of having



<P>provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own,



<P>I have borne it as much as possible without spreading



<P>it farther.&nbsp; I acquit Edward of essential misconduct.



<P>I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always



<P>doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret,



<P>in the end he must become so.&nbsp; Lucy does not want sense,



<P>and that is the foundation on which every thing good may



<P>be built.--And after all, Marianne, after all that is



<P>bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment,



<P>and all that can be said of one's happiness depending



<P>entirely on any particular person, it is not meant--it



<P>is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.--



<P>Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior



<P>in person and understanding to half her sex; and time



<P>and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought



<P>another superior to HER."--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If such is your way of thinking," said Marianne,



<P>"if the loss of what is most valued is so easily



<P>to be made up by something else, your resolution,



<P>your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be



<P>wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand you.--You do not suppose that

I have ever



<P>felt much.--For four months, Marianne, I have had all this



<P>hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak



<P>of it to a single creature; knowing that it would make



<P>you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained



<P>to you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.--



<P>It was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the



<P>very person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all



<P>my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph.--



<P>This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose,



<P>by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most



<P>deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have



<P>had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.--



<P>I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever,



<P>without hearing one circumstance that could make me less



<P>desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy;



<P>nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.--



<P>I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister,



<P>and the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the



<P>punishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages.--



<P>And all this has been going on at a time, when, as you



<P>know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness.--



<P>If you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you



<P>may suppose that I have suffered NOW.&nbsp; The composure



<P>of mind with which I have brought myself at present



<P>to consider the matter, the consolation that I have been



<P>willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and



<P>painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;--



<P>they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.--



<P>No, Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence,



<P>perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely--not even what I



<P>owed to my dearest friends--from openly shewing that I was



<P>VERY unhappy."--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was quite subdued.--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! Elinor," she cried, "you have made me

hate



<P>myself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!--



<P>you, who have been my only comfort, who have borne with me



<P>in all my misery, who have seemed to be only suffering



<P>for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I



<P>can make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself,



<P>I have been trying to do it away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tenderest caresses followed this confession.



<P>In such a frame of mind as she was now in, Elinor had



<P>no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise



<P>she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged



<P>never to speak of the affair to any one with the least



<P>appearance of bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying



<P>the smallest increase of dislike to her;--and even to see



<P>Edward himself, if chance should bring them together,



<P>without any diminution of her usual cordiality.--



<P>These were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt



<P>that she had injured, no reparation could be too much



<P>for her to make.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She performed her promise of being discreet,



<P>to admiration.--She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings



<P>had to say upon the subject, with an unchanging complexion,



<P>dissented from her in nothing, and was heard three



<P>times to say, "Yes, ma'am."--She listened to her praise



<P>of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another,



<P>and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward's affection,



<P>it cost her only a spasm in her throat.--Such advances



<P>towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal



<P>to any thing herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning brought a farther trial of

it,



<P>in a visit from their brother, who came with a most serious



<P>aspect to talk over the dreadful affair, and bring them



<P>news of his wife.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have heard, I suppose," said he with great

solemnity,



<P>as soon as he was seated, "of the very shocking discovery



<P>that took place under our roof yesterday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They all looked their assent; it seemed too

awful



<P>a moment for speech.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your sister," he continued, "has suffered

dreadfully.



<P>Mrs. Ferrars too--in short it has been a scene of such



<P>complicated distress--but I will hope that the storm may



<P>be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome.



<P>Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday.



<P>But I would not alarm you too much.&nbsp; Donavan says there



<P>is nothing materially to be apprehended; her constitution



<P>is a good one, and her resolution equal to any thing.



<P>She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an angel!



<P>She says she never shall think well of anybody again;



<P>and one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--



<P>meeting with such ingratitude, where so much kindness



<P>had been shewn, so much confidence had been placed!&nbsp; It



<P>was quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that she



<P>had asked these young women to her house; merely because



<P>she thought they deserved some attention, were harmless,



<P>well-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions;



<P>for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you



<P>and Marianne to be with us, while your kind friend there,



<P>was attending her daughter.&nbsp; And now to be so rewarded!



<P>'I wish, with all my heart,' says poor Fanny in her



<P>affectionate way, 'that we had asked your sisters instead



<P>of them.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here he stopped to be thanked; which being

done,



<P>he went on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first

Fanny



<P>broke it to her, is not to be described.&nbsp; While she with



<P>the truest affection had been planning a most eligible



<P>connection for him, was it to be supposed that he could



<P>be all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such



<P>a suspicion could never have entered her head!&nbsp; If she



<P>suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere, it could not be



<P>in THAT quarter.&nbsp; 'THERE, to be sure,' said she, 'I might



<P>have thought myself safe.' She was quite in an agony.



<P>We consulted together, however, as to what should be done,



<P>and at last she determined to send for Edward.



<P>He came.&nbsp; But I am sorry to relate what ensued.



<P>All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end



<P>to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose



<P>by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of



<P>no avail.&nbsp; Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.



<P>I never thought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before.



<P>His mother explained to him her liberal designs, in case



<P>of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle on



<P>him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings



<P>in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters



<P>grew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition



<P>to this, if he still persisted in this low connection,



<P>represented to him the certain penury that must attend



<P>the match.&nbsp; His own two thousand pounds she protested



<P>should be his all; she would never see him again; and so far



<P>would she be from affording him the smallest assistance,



<P>that if he were to enter into any profession with a view



<P>of better support, she would do all in her power to prevent



<P>him advancing in it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation,



<P>clapped her hands together, and cried, "Gracious God!



<P>can this be possible!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well may you wonder, Marianne," replied her

brother,



<P>"at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these.



<P>Your exclamation is very natural."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered



<P>her promises, and forbore.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All this, however," he continued, "was urged

in vain.



<P>Edward said very little; but what he did say, was in



<P>the most determined manner.&nbsp; Nothing should prevail on



<P>him to give up his engagement.&nbsp; He would stand to it,



<P>cost him what it might."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then," cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity,



<P>no longer able to be silent, "he has acted like an honest



<P>man! I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, but if he had



<P>done otherwise, I should have thought him a rascal.



<P>I have some little concern in the business, as well



<P>as yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe



<P>there is not a better kind of girl in the world, nor one



<P>who more deserves a good husband."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his

nature



<P>was calm, not open to provocation, and he never wished



<P>to offend anybody, especially anybody of good fortune.



<P>He therefore replied, without any resentment,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would by no means speak disrespectfully

of any



<P>relation of yours, madam.&nbsp; Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say,



<P>a very deserving young woman, but in the present case



<P>you know, the connection must be impossible.



<P>And to have entered into a secret engagement with a



<P>young man under her uncle's care, the son of a woman



<P>especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars,



<P>is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In short,



<P>I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person



<P>whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.&nbsp; We all wish



<P>her extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout



<P>the whole, has been such as every conscientious, good mother,



<P>in like circumstances, would adopt.&nbsp; It has been dignified



<P>and liberal.&nbsp; Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear



<P>it will be a bad one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension;



<P>and Elinor's heart wrung for the feelings of Edward,



<P>while braving his mother's threats, for a woman who could



<P>not reward him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, sir," said Mrs. Jennings, "and how did

it end?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most unhappy

rupture:--



<P>Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother's notice.



<P>He left her house yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether



<P>he is still in town, I do not know; for WE of course can



<P>make no inquiry."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor young man!--and what is to become of

him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What, indeed, ma'am!&nbsp; It is a melancholy

consideration.



<P>Born to the prospect of such affluence!&nbsp; I cannot conceive



<P>a situation more deplorable.&nbsp; The interest of two thousand



<P>pounds--how can a man live on it?--and when to that is added



<P>the recollection, that he might, but for his own folly,



<P>within three months have been in the receipt of two



<P>thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has



<P>thirty thousand pounds,) I cannot picture to myself



<P>a more wretched condition.&nbsp; We must all feel for him;



<P>and the more so, because it is totally out of our power



<P>to assist him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor young man!" cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am

sure



<P>he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house;



<P>and so I would tell him if I could see him.&nbsp; It is not fit



<P>that he should be living about at his own charge now,



<P>at lodgings and taverns."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness

towards Edward,



<P>though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he would only have done as well by himself,"



<P>said John Dashwood, "as all his friends were disposed to do



<P>by him, he might now have been in his proper situation,



<P>and would have wanted for nothing.&nbsp; But as it is, it must



<P>be out of anybody's power to assist him.&nbsp; And there is one



<P>thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than



<P>all--his mother has determined, with a very natural kind



<P>of spirit, to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately,



<P>which might have been Edward's, on proper conditions.



<P>I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking over



<P>the business."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well!" said Mrs. Jennings, "that is HER revenge.



<P>Everybody has a way of their own.&nbsp; But I don't think mine



<P>would be, to make one son independent, because another had



<P>plagued me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne got up and walked about the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can anything be more galling to the spirit

of a man,"



<P>continued John, "than to see his younger brother in



<P>possession of an estate which might have been his own?



<P>Poor Edward!&nbsp; I feel for him sincerely."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few minutes more spent in the same kind of

effusion,



<P>concluded his visit; and with repeated assurances to his



<P>sisters that he really believed there was no material



<P>danger in Fanny's indisposition, and that they need



<P>not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;



<P>leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments



<P>on the present occasion, as far at least as it regarded



<P>Mrs. Ferrars's conduct, the Dashwoods', and Edward's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon

as he



<P>quitted the room; and as her vehemence made reserve



<P>impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings,



<P>they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However small Elinor's general dependence on



<P>Lucy's veracity might be, it was impossible for her



<P>on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case,



<P>where no temptation could be answerable to the folly



<P>of inventing a falsehood of such a description.&nbsp; What Lucy



<P>had asserted to be true, therefore, Elinor could not,



<P>dared not longer doubt; supported as it was too on every



<P>side by such probabilities and proofs, and contradicted



<P>by nothing but her own wishes.&nbsp; Their opportunity of



<P>acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation



<P>for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's



<P>visit near Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind,



<P>his dissatisfaction at his own prospects, his uncertain



<P>behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the



<P>Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections,



<P>which had often surprised her, the picture, the letter,



<P>the ring, formed altogether such a body of evidence,



<P>as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly,



<P>and established as a fact, which no partiality could



<P>set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.--Her resentment



<P>of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe,



<P>for a short time made her feel only for herself;



<P>but other ideas, other considerations, soon arose.



<P>Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?&nbsp; Had he feigned



<P>a regard for her which he did not feel?&nbsp; Was his engagement



<P>to Lucy an engagement of the heart?&nbsp; No; whatever it might



<P>once have been, she could not believe it such at present.



<P>His affection was all her own.&nbsp; She could not be deceived



<P>in that.&nbsp; Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been



<P>conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not



<P>an illusion of her own vanity.&nbsp; He certainly loved her.



<P>What a softener of the heart was this persuasion!&nbsp; How much



<P>could it not tempt her to forgive!&nbsp; He had been blamable,



<P>highly blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first



<P>felt her influence over him to be more than it ought



<P>to be.&nbsp; In that, he could not be defended; but if he



<P>had injured her, how much more had he injured himself;



<P>if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless.



<P>His imprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it



<P>seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever



<P>being otherwise.&nbsp; She might in time regain tranquillity;



<P>but HE, what had he to look forward to?&nbsp; Could he



<P>ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he,



<P>were his affection for herself out of the question,



<P>with his integrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind,



<P>be satisfied with a wife like her--illiterate, artful,



<P>and selfish?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The youthful infatuation of nineteen would

naturally



<P>blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature;



<P>but the four succeeding years--years, which if rationally



<P>spent, give such improvement to the understanding, must



<P>have opened his eyes to her defects of education,



<P>while the same period of time, spent on her side



<P>in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits,



<P>had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might



<P>once have given an interesting character to her beauty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If in the supposition of his seeking to marry

herself,



<P>his difficulties from his mother had seemed great,



<P>how much greater were they now likely to be, when



<P>the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior



<P>in connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.



<P>These difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated



<P>from Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience;



<P>but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the



<P>expectation of family opposition and unkindness, could



<P>be felt as a relief!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As these considerations occurred to her in

painful



<P>succession, she wept for him, more than for herself.



<P>Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to



<P>merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief



<P>that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem,



<P>she thought she could even now, under the first smart



<P>of the heavy blow, command herself enough to guard every



<P>suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters.



<P>And so well was she able to answer her own expectations,



<P>that when she joined them at dinner only two hours



<P>after she had first suffered the extinction of all her



<P>dearest hopes, no one would have supposed from the



<P>appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning



<P>in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever



<P>from the object of her love, and that Marianne was



<P>internally dwelling on the perfections of a man, of whose



<P>whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she



<P>expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The necessity of concealing from her mother

and



<P>Marianne, what had been entrusted in confidence to herself,



<P>though it obliged her to unceasing exertion, was no



<P>aggravation of Elinor's distress.&nbsp; On the contrary



<P>it was a relief to her, to be spared the communication



<P>of what would give such affliction to them, and to be



<P>saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward,



<P>which would probably flow from the excess of their partial



<P>affection for herself, and which was more than she felt



<P>equal to support.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From their counsel, or their conversation,

she knew



<P>she could receive no assistance, their tenderness and



<P>sorrow must add to her distress, while her self-command



<P>would neither receive encouragement from their example



<P>nor from their praise.&nbsp; She was stronger alone,



<P>and her own good sense so well supported her, that her



<P>firmness was as unshaken, her appearance of cheerfulness



<P>as invariable, as with regrets so poignant and so fresh,



<P>it was possible for them to be.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much as she had suffered from her first conversation



<P>with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt an earnest wish



<P>of renewing it; and this for more reasons than one.



<P>She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement



<P>repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand



<P>what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any



<P>sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him,



<P>and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her



<P>readiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness



<P>in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested



<P>in it than as a friend, which she very much feared



<P>her involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse,



<P>must have left at least doubtful.&nbsp; That Lucy was disposed



<P>to be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain



<P>that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise,



<P>not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing



<P>to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance,



<P>with a secret so confessedly and evidently important.



<P>And even Sir John's joking intelligence must have had



<P>some weight.&nbsp; But indeed, while Elinor remained so well



<P>assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward,



<P>it required no other consideration of probabilities



<P>to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous;



<P>and that she was so, her very confidence was a proof.



<P>What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could



<P>there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy's



<P>superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him



<P>in future?&nbsp; She had little difficulty in understanding thus



<P>much of her rival's intentions, and while she was firmly



<P>resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and



<P>honesty directed, to combat her own affection for Edward



<P>and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny



<P>herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy



<P>that her heart was unwounded.&nbsp; And as she could now have



<P>nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already



<P>been told, she did not mistrust her own ability of going



<P>through a repetition of particulars with composure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was not immediately that an opportunity



<P>of doing so could be commanded, though Lucy was as well



<P>disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred;



<P>for the weather was not often fine enough to allow



<P>of their joining in a walk, where they might most easily



<P>separate themselves from the others; and though they



<P>met at least every other evening either at the park



<P>or cottage, and chiefly at the former, they could



<P>not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation.



<P>Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady



<P>Middleton's head; and therefore very little leisure



<P>was ever given for a general chat, and none at all for



<P>particular discourse.&nbsp; They met for the sake of eating,



<P>drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,



<P>or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One or two meetings of this kind had taken

place,



<P>without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy



<P>in private, when Sir John called at the cottage one morning,



<P>to beg, in the name of charity, that they would all



<P>dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged



<P>to attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be



<P>quite alone, except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.



<P>Elinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she



<P>had in view, in such a party as this was likely to be,



<P>more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil



<P>and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when



<P>her husband united them together in one noisy purpose,



<P>immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her



<P>mother's permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne,



<P>though always unwilling to join any of their parties,



<P>was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her



<P>seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was

happily



<P>preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her.



<P>The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor



<P>had expected; it produced not one novelty of thought



<P>or expression, and nothing could be less interesting



<P>than the whole of their discourse both in the dining



<P>parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children



<P>accompanied them, and while they remained there, she was



<P>too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy's



<P>attention to attempt it.&nbsp; They quitted it only with the



<P>removal of the tea-things.&nbsp; The card-table was then placed,



<P>and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever



<P>entertained a hope of finding time for conversation



<P>at the park.&nbsp; They all rose up in preparation for a round game.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am glad," said Lady Middleton to Lucy,



<P>"you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria's



<P>basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt your



<P>eyes to work filigree by candlelight.&nbsp; And we will make



<P>the dear little love some amends for her disappointment



<P>to-morrow, and then I hope she will not much mind it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself

instantly



<P>and replied, "Indeed you are very much mistaken,



<P>Lady Middleton; I am only waiting to know whether you can



<P>make your party without me, or I should have been at my



<P>filigree already.&nbsp; I would not disappoint the little angel



<P>for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now,



<P>I am resolved to finish the basket after supper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very good, I hope it won't hurt your

eyes--



<P>will you ring the bell for some working candles?



<P>My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed, I know,



<P>if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for though I



<P>told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends



<P>upon having it done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy directly drew her work table near her



<P>and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness



<P>which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater



<P>delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino

to the others.



<P>No one made any objection but Marianne, who with her usual



<P>inattention to the forms of general civility, exclaimed,



<P>"Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME--you



<P>know I detest cards.&nbsp; I shall go to the piano-forte;



<P>I have not touched it since it was tuned."&nbsp; And without



<P>farther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven



<P>that SHE had never made so rude a speech.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marianne can never keep long from that instrument



<P>you know, ma'am," said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth



<P>away the offence; "and I do not much wonder at it; for it



<P>is the very best toned piano-forte I ever heard."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining five were now to draw their cards.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps," continued Elinor, "if I should happen



<P>to cut out, I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele,



<P>in rolling her papers for her; and there is so much still



<P>to be done to the basket, that it must be impossible



<P>I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening.



<P>I should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow



<P>me a share in it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you



<P>for your help," cried Lucy, "for I find there is more



<P>to be done to it than I thought there was; and it would



<P>be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! that would be terrible, indeed," said

Miss Steele--



<P>"Dear little soul, how I do love her!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very kind," said Lady Middleton to

Elinor;



<P>"and as you really like the work, perhaps you will be



<P>as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber,



<P>or will you take your chance now?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these

proposals,



<P>and thus by a little of that address which Marianne



<P>could never condescend to practise, gained her own end,



<P>and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time.&nbsp; Lucy made room



<P>for her with ready attention, and the two fair rivals were



<P>thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the



<P>utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.



<P>The pianoforte at which Marianne, wrapped up in her own



<P>music and her own thoughts, had by this time forgotten



<P>that any body was in the room besides herself, was luckily



<P>so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely,



<P>under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting



<P>subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne, who had never much toleration for

any



<P>thing like impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts,



<P>or even difference of taste from herself, was at



<P>this time particularly ill-disposed, from the state



<P>of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles,



<P>or to encourage their advances; and to the invariable



<P>coldness of her behaviour towards them, which checked every



<P>endeavour at intimacy on their side, Elinor principally



<P>attributed that preference of herself which soon became



<P>evident in the manners of both, but especially of Lucy,



<P>who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation,



<P>or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy



<P>and frank communication of her sentiments.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks were

often



<P>just and amusing; and as a companion for half an hour



<P>Elinor frequently found her agreeable; but her powers



<P>had received no aid from education: she was ignorant



<P>and illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement,



<P>her want of information in the most common particulars,



<P>could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood, in spite of her



<P>constant endeavour to appear to advantage.&nbsp; Elinor saw,



<P>and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities which education



<P>might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with less



<P>tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy,



<P>of rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions,



<P>her assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed;



<P>and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company



<P>of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance;



<P>whose want of instruction prevented their meeting



<P>in conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct



<P>toward others made every shew of attention and deference



<P>towards herself perfectly valueless.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will think my question an odd one, I dare

say,"



<P>said Lucy to her one day, as they were walking together



<P>from the park to the cottage--"but pray, are you



<P>personally acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother,



<P>Mrs. Ferrars?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor DID think the question a very odd one,



<P>and her countenance expressed it, as she answered that she



<P>had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed!" replied Lucy; "I wonder at that,

for I



<P>thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes.



<P>Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman



<P>she is?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," returned Elinor, cautious of giving her

real



<P>opinion of Edward's mother, and not very desirous



<P>of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity--



<P>"I know nothing of her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring



<P>about her in such a way," said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively



<P>as she spoke; "but perhaps there may be reasons--I wish



<P>I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice



<P>of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked

on



<P>for a few minutes in silence.&nbsp; It was broken by Lucy,



<P>who renewed the subject again by saying, with some



<P>hesitation,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently

curious.



<P>I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be



<P>thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth



<P>having as yours.&nbsp; And I am sure I should not have the smallest



<P>fear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should be very glad of your



<P>advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation



<P>as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU.



<P>I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry I do NOT," said Elinor, in great

astonishment,



<P>"if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her.



<P>But really I never understood that you were at all connected



<P>with that family, and therefore I am a little surprised,



<P>I confess, at so serious an inquiry into her character."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not

at all



<P>wonder at it.&nbsp; But if I dared tell you all, you would not be



<P>so much surprised.&nbsp; Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me



<P>at present--but the time MAY come--how soon it will come



<P>must depend upon herself--when we may be very intimately connected."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful,



<P>with only one side glance at her companion to observe its



<P>effect on her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good heavens!" cried Elinor, "what do you

mean?



<P>Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars?&nbsp; Can you be?"



<P>And she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such



<P>a sister-in-law.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," replied Lucy, "not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I



<P>never saw him in my life; but," fixing her eyes upon Elinor,



<P>"to his eldest brother."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment,



<P>that would have been as painful as it was strong, had not



<P>an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it.



<P>She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement, unable to divine



<P>the reason or object of such a declaration; and though



<P>her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity,



<P>and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may well be surprised," continued Lucy;



<P>"for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before;



<P>for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it



<P>to you or any of your family; because it was always meant



<P>to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully



<P>kept so by me to this hour.&nbsp; Not a soul of all my relations



<P>know of it but Anne, and I never should have mentioned



<P>it to you, if I had not felt the greatest dependence



<P>in the world upon your secrecy; and I really thought my



<P>behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars



<P>must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.



<P>And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased,



<P>when he knows I have trusted you, because I know he has



<P>the highest opinion in the world of all your family,



<P>and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite



<P>as his own sisters."--She paused.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor for a few moments remained silent.



<P>Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too



<P>great for words; but at length forcing herself to speak,



<P>and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,



<P>which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude--



<P>"May I ask if your engagement is of long standing?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have been engaged these four years."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Four years!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt

unable



<P>to believe it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did not know," said she, "that you were

even



<P>acquainted till the other day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our acquaintance, however, is of many years

date.



<P>He was under my uncle's care, you know, a considerable while."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your uncle!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; Mr. Pratt.&nbsp; Did you never hear him

talk



<P>of Mr. Pratt?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think I have," replied Elinor, with an exertion



<P>of spirits, which increased with her increase of emotion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He was four years with my uncle, who lives

at Longstaple,



<P>near Plymouth.&nbsp; It was there our acquaintance begun,



<P>for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle,



<P>and it was there our engagement was formed, though not till



<P>a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he was almost



<P>always with us afterwards.&nbsp; I was very unwilling to enter



<P>into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and



<P>approbation of his mother; but I was too young, and loved



<P>him too well, to be so prudent as I ought to have been.--



<P>Though you do not know him so well as me, Miss Dashwood,



<P>you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is



<P>very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly," answered Elinor, without knowing

what



<P>she said; but after a moment's reflection, she added,



<P>with revived security of Edward's honour and love,



<P>and her companion's falsehood--"Engaged to Mr. Edward



<P>Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at



<P>what you tell me, that really--I beg your pardon;



<P>but surely there must be some mistake of person or name.



<P>We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can mean no other," cried Lucy, smiling.&nbsp;

"Mr. Edward



<P>Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street,



<P>and brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood,



<P>is the person I mean; you must allow that I am not likely



<P>to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is strange," replied Elinor, in a most

painful perplexity,



<P>"that I should never have heard him even mention your name."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No; considering our situation, it was not

strange.



<P>Our first care has been to keep the matter secret.--



<P>You knew nothing of me, or my family, and, therefore,



<P>there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name



<P>to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his



<P>sister's suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough



<P>for his not mentioning it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was silent.--Elinor's security sunk; but

her



<P>self-command did not sink with it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Four years you have been engaged," said she



<P>with a firm voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may

have



<P>to wait.&nbsp; Poor Edward!&nbsp; It puts him quite out of heart."



<P>Then taking a small miniature from her pocket, she added,



<P>"To prevent the possibility of mistake, be so good as to look



<P>at this face.&nbsp; It does not do him justice, to be sure,



<P>but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person



<P>it was drew for.--I have had it above these three years."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put it into her hands as she spoke; and

when Elinor



<P>saw the painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a



<P>too hasty decision, or her wish of detecting falsehood



<P>might suffer to linger in her mind, she could have none of



<P>its being Edward's face.&nbsp; She returned it almost instantly,



<P>acknowledging the likeness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never been able," continued Lucy, "to

give



<P>him my picture in return, which I am very much vexed at,



<P>for he has been always so anxious to get it!&nbsp; But I am



<P>determined to set for it the very first opportunity."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are quite in the right," replied Elinor

calmly.



<P>They then proceeded a few paces in silence.&nbsp; Lucy spoke first.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sure," said she, "I have no doubt in

the world



<P>of your faithfully keeping this secret, because you must



<P>know of what importance it is to us, not to have it reach



<P>his mother; for she would never approve of it, I dare say.



<P>I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding



<P>proud woman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I certainly did not seek your confidence,"

said Elinor;



<P>"but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I



<P>may be depended on.&nbsp; Your secret is safe with me;



<P>but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary



<P>a communication.&nbsp; You must at least have felt that my



<P>being acquainted with it could not add to its safety."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy,



<P>hoping to discover something in her countenance; perhaps the



<P>falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying;



<P>but Lucy's countenance suffered no change.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was afraid you would think I was taking

a great



<P>liberty with you," said she, "in telling you all this.



<P>I have not known you long to be sure, personally at least,



<P>but I have known you and all your family by description



<P>a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as if



<P>you was an old acquaintance.&nbsp; Besides in the present case,



<P>I really thought some explanation was due to you after my



<P>making such particular inquiries about Edward's mother;



<P>and I am so unfortunate, that I have not a creature whose



<P>advice I can ask.&nbsp; Anne is the only person that knows of it,



<P>and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a great



<P>deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her



<P>betraying me.&nbsp; She does not know how to hold her tongue,



<P>as you must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest



<P>fright in the world t'other day, when Edward's name was



<P>mentioned by Sir John, lest she should out with it all.



<P>You can't think how much I go through in my mind from



<P>it altogether.&nbsp; I only wonder that I am alive after what



<P>I have suffered for Edward's sake these last four years.



<P>Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing



<P>him so seldom--we can hardly meet above twice a-year.



<P>I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor

did



<P>not feel very compassionate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes." continued Lucy, after wiping her

eyes,



<P>"I think whether it would not be better for us both



<P>to break off the matter entirely."&nbsp; As she said this,



<P>she looked directly at her companion.&nbsp; "But then



<P>at other times I have not resolution enough for it.--



<P>I cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable,



<P>as I know the very mention of such a thing would do.



<P>And on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--I don't



<P>think I could be equal to it.&nbsp; What would you advise



<P>me to do in such a case, Miss Dashwood?&nbsp; What would you



<P>do yourself?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pardon me," replied Elinor, startled by the

question;



<P>"but I can give you no advice under such circumstances.



<P>Your own judgment must direct you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be sure," continued Lucy, after a few minutes



<P>silence on both sides, "his mother must provide for him



<P>sometime or other; but poor Edward is so cast down by it!



<P>Did you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at



<P>Barton?&nbsp; He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple,



<P>to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him quite ill."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did he come from your uncle's, then, when

he visited us?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with

us.



<P>Did you think he came directly from town?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible

of



<P>every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity;



<P>"I remember he told us, that he had been staying



<P>a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth."



<P>She remembered too, her own surprise at the time,



<P>at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends,



<P>at his total silence with respect even to their names.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?"



<P>repeated Lucy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We did, indeed, particularly so when he first

arrived."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I begged him to exert himself for fear you



<P>should suspect what was the matter; but it made him



<P>so melancholy, not being able to stay more than a



<P>fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.--



<P>Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now;



<P>for he writes in wretched spirits.&nbsp; I heard from him just



<P>before I left Exeter;" taking a letter from her pocket



<P>and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.



<P>"You know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is;



<P>but that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired,



<P>I dare say, for he had just filled the sheet to me as full



<P>as possible."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could

doubt



<P>no longer.&nbsp; This picture, she had allowed herself to believe,



<P>might have been accidentally obtained; it might not have



<P>been Edward's gift; but a correspondence between them



<P>by letter, could subsist only under a positive engagement,



<P>could be authorised by nothing else; for a few moments, she



<P>was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she could



<P>hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary;



<P>and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression



<P>of her feelings, that her success was speedy, and for



<P>the time complete.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Writing to each other," said Lucy, returning

the



<P>letter into her pocket, "is the only comfort we have



<P>in such long separations.&nbsp; Yes, I have one other comfort



<P>in his picture, but poor Edward has not even THAT.



<P>If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.



<P>I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at



<P>Longstaple last, and that was some comfort to him, he said,



<P>but not equal to a picture.&nbsp; Perhaps you might notice



<P>the ring when you saw him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did," said Elinor, with a composure of voice,



<P>under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond



<P>any thing she had ever felt before.&nbsp; She was mortified,



<P>shocked, confounded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately for her, they had now reached the

cottage,



<P>and the conversation could be continued no farther.



<P>After sitting with them a few minutes, the Miss Steeles



<P>returned to the Park, and Elinor was then at liberty



<P>to think and be wretched.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers



<P>announced to the world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer,



<P>Esq. was safely delivered of a son and heir; a very



<P>interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least to all



<P>those intimate connections who knew it before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's

happiness,



<P>produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time,



<P>and influenced, in a like degree, the engagements



<P>of her young friends; for as she wished to be as much



<P>as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning



<P>as soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late



<P>in the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular



<P>request of the Middletons, spent the whole of every day,



<P>in every day in Conduit Street.&nbsp; For their own comfort



<P>they would much rather have remained, at least all



<P>the morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not



<P>a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody.



<P>Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton



<P>and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact



<P>was as little valued, as it was professedly sought.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had too much sense to be desirable companions



<P>to the former; and by the latter they were considered with



<P>a jealous eye, as intruding on THEIR ground, and sharing



<P>the kindness which they wanted to monopolize.&nbsp; Though nothing



<P>could be more polite than Lady Middleton's behaviour to



<P>Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.



<P>Because they neither flattered herself nor her children,



<P>she could not believe them good-natured; and because they



<P>were fond of reading, she fancied them satirical: perhaps



<P>without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical;



<P>but THAT did not signify.&nbsp; It was censure in common use,



<P>and easily given.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their presence was a restraint both on her

and on Lucy.



<P>It checked the idleness of one, and the business of the other.



<P>Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them,



<P>and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of



<P>and administer at other times, she feared they would despise



<P>her for offering.&nbsp; Miss Steele was the least discomposed



<P>of the three, by their presence; and it was in their power



<P>to reconcile her to it entirely.&nbsp; Would either of them



<P>only have given her a full and minute account of the whole



<P>affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she would



<P>have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice



<P>of the best place by the fire after dinner, which their



<P>arrival occasioned.&nbsp; But this conciliation was not granted;



<P>for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her



<P>sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt a reflection



<P>on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect



<P>was produced, but a look of indifference from the former,



<P>or of disgust in the latter.&nbsp; An effort even yet lighter



<P>might have made her their friend.&nbsp; Would they only have



<P>laughed at her about the Doctor!&nbsp; But so little were they,



<P>anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her,



<P>that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole



<P>day without hearing any other raillery on the subject,



<P>than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these jealousies and discontents, however,

were so



<P>totally unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought



<P>it a delightful thing for the girls to be together;



<P>and generally congratulated her young friends every night,



<P>on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long.



<P>She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes



<P>at her own house; but wherever it was, she always came



<P>in excellent spirits, full of delight and importance,



<P>attributing Charlotte's well doing to her own care, and ready



<P>to give so exact, so minute a detail of her situation,



<P>as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.



<P>One thing DID disturb her; and of that she made her



<P>daily complaint.&nbsp; Mr. Palmer maintained the common,



<P>but unfatherly opinion among his sex, of all infants being alike;



<P>and though she could plainly perceive, at different times,



<P>the most striking resemblance between this baby and every



<P>one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing



<P>his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it



<P>was not exactly like every other baby of the same age;



<P>nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple



<P>proposition of its being the finest child in the world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I come now to the relation of a misfortune,



<P>which about this time befell Mrs. John Dashwood.



<P>It so happened that while her two sisters with



<P>Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street,



<P>another of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance



<P>in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her.



<P>But while the imaginations of other people will carry



<P>them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct,



<P>and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness



<P>must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.



<P>In the present instance, this last-arrived lady allowed



<P>her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability,



<P>that on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods,



<P>and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters,



<P>she immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street;



<P>and this misconstruction produced within a day



<P>or two afterwards, cards of invitation for them



<P>as well as for their brother and sister, to a small



<P>musical party at her house.&nbsp; The consequence of which was,



<P>that Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only



<P>to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her



<P>carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what was still worse,



<P>must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing



<P>to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they



<P>might not expect to go out with her a second time?&nbsp; The power



<P>of disappointing them, it was true, must always be her's.



<P>But that was not enough; for when people are determined



<P>on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel



<P>injured by the expectation of any thing better from them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so

much



<P>into the habit of going out every day, that it was become



<P>a matter of indifference to her, whether she went or not:



<P>and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every



<P>evening's engagement, though without expecting the smallest



<P>amusement from any, and very often without knowing,



<P>till the last moment, where it was to take her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To her dress and appearance she was grown so

perfectly



<P>indifferent, as not to bestow half the consideration on it,



<P>during the whole of her toilet, which it received from



<P>Miss Steele in the first five minutes of their being



<P>together, when it was finished.&nbsp; Nothing escaped HER minute



<P>observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing,



<P>and asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price



<P>of every part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the



<P>number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than



<P>Marianne herself, and was not without hopes of finding out



<P>before they parted, how much her washing cost per week,



<P>and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.



<P>The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover,



<P>was generally concluded with a compliment, which



<P>though meant as its douceur, was considered by Marianne



<P>as the greatest impertinence of all; for after undergoing



<P>an examination into the value and make of her gown,



<P>the colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair,



<P>she was almost sure of being told that upon "her word



<P>she looked vastly smart, and she dared to say she would



<P>make a great many conquests."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed



<P>on the present occasion, to her brother's carriage;



<P>which they were ready to enter five minutes after it



<P>stopped at the door, a punctuality not very agreeable



<P>to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house



<P>of her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay



<P>on their part that might inconvenience either herself



<P>or her coachman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The events of this evening were not very remarkable.



<P>The party, like other musical parties, comprehended a



<P>great many people who had real taste for the performance,



<P>and a great many more who had none at all; and the performers



<P>themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,



<P>and that of their immediate friends, the first private



<P>performers in England.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting

to be so,



<P>she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand



<P>pianoforte, whenever it suited her, and unrestrained even



<P>by the presence of a harp, and violoncello, would fix



<P>them at pleasure on any other object in the room.&nbsp; In one



<P>of these excursive glances she perceived among a group



<P>of young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture



<P>on toothpick-cases at Gray's.&nbsp; She perceived him soon



<P>afterwards looking at herself, and speaking familiarly



<P>to her brother; and had just determined to find out his



<P>name from the latter, when they both came towards her,



<P>and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted



<P>his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as



<P>words could have done, that he was exactly the coxcomb



<P>she had heard him described to be by Lucy.&nbsp; Happy had



<P>it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended



<P>less on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest



<P>relations!&nbsp; For then his brother's bow must have given



<P>the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother



<P>and sister would have begun.&nbsp; But while she wondered



<P>at the difference of the two young men, she did not find



<P>that the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out



<P>of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other.



<P>Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself



<P>in the course of a quarter of an hour's conversation;



<P>for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme



<P>GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing



<P>in proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it



<P>much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune



<P>of a private education; while he himself, though probably



<P>without any particular, any material superiority



<P>by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,



<P>was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my soul," he added, "I believe it is

nothing more;



<P>and so I often tell my mother, when she is grieving



<P>about it.&nbsp; 'My dear Madam,' I always say to her, 'you must



<P>make yourself easy.&nbsp; The evil is now irremediable,



<P>and it has been entirely your own doing.&nbsp; Why would



<P>you be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your



<P>own judgment, to place Edward under private tuition,



<P>at the most critical time of his life?&nbsp; If you had only sent



<P>him to Westminster as well as myself, instead of sending



<P>him to Mr. Pratt's, all this would have been prevented.'



<P>This is the way in which I always consider the matter,



<P>and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because,



<P>whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage



<P>of a public school, she could not think of Edward's



<P>abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You reside in Devonshire, I think,"--was his



<P>next observation, "in a cottage near Dawlish."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor set him right as to its situation;



<P>and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody



<P>could live in Devonshire, without living near Dawlish.



<P>He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their



<P>species of house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For my own part," said he, "I am excessively

fond



<P>of a cottage; there is always so much comfort, so much



<P>elegance about them.&nbsp; And I protest, if I had any money



<P>to spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself,



<P>within a short distance of London, where I might drive



<P>myself down at any time, and collect a few friends



<P>about me, and be happy.&nbsp; I advise every body who is going



<P>to build, to build a cottage.&nbsp; My friend Lord Courtland



<P>came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,



<P>and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi's.



<P>I was to decide on the best of them.&nbsp; 'My dear Courtland,'



<P>said I, immediately throwing them all into the fire, 'do not



<P>adopt either of them, but by all means build a cottage.'



<P>And that I fancy, will be the end of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations,



<P>no space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake.



<P>I was last month at my friend Elliott's, near Dartford.



<P>Lady Elliott wished to give a dance.&nbsp; 'But how can it



<P>be done?' said she; 'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it



<P>is to be managed.&nbsp; There is not a room in this cottage



<P>that will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?'



<P>I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it,



<P>so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, do not be uneasy.



<P>The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;



<P>card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library



<P>may be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the



<P>supper be set out in the saloon.'&nbsp; Lady Elliott was delighted



<P>with the thought.&nbsp; We measured the dining-room, and found



<P>it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the affair



<P>was arranged precisely after my plan.&nbsp; So that, in fact,



<P>you see, if people do but know how to set about it,



<P>every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage



<P>as in the most spacious dwelling."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think



<P>he deserved the compliment of rational opposition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music

than his



<P>eldest sister, his mind was equally at liberty to fix on



<P>any thing else; and a thought struck him during the evening,



<P>which he communicated to his wife, for her approbation,



<P>when they got home.&nbsp; The consideration of Mrs. Dennison's mistake,



<P>in supposing his sisters their guests, had suggested the



<P>propriety of their being really invited to become such,



<P>while Mrs. Jenning's engagements kept her from home.



<P>The expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more;



<P>and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy



<P>of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its



<P>complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father.



<P>Fanny was startled at the proposal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not see how it can be done," said she,



<P>"without affronting Lady Middleton, for they spend every day



<P>with her; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it.



<P>You know I am always ready to pay them any attention



<P>in my power, as my taking them out this evening shews.



<P>But they are Lady Middleton's visitors.&nbsp; How can I ask them



<P>away from her?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her husband, but with great humility, did not

see



<P>the force of her objection.&nbsp; "They had already spent a week



<P>in this manner in Conduit Street, and Lady Middleton



<P>could not be displeased at their giving the same number



<P>of days to such near relations."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh

vigor, said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My love I would ask them with all my heart,

if it



<P>was in my power.&nbsp; But I had just settled within myself



<P>to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us.



<P>They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I think



<P>the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very



<P>well by Edward.&nbsp; We can ask your sisters some other year,



<P>you know; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more.



<P>I am sure you will like them; indeed, you DO like them,



<P>you know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they



<P>are such favourites with Harry!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Dashwood was convinced.&nbsp; He saw the

necessity



<P>of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately, and his conscience



<P>was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters



<P>another year; at the same time, however, slyly suspecting



<P>that another year would make the invitation needless,



<P>by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife,



<P>and Marianne as THEIR visitor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of

the ready



<P>wit that had procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy,



<P>to request her company and her sister's, for some days,



<P>in Harley Street, as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them.



<P>This was enough to make Lucy really and reasonably happy.



<P>Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her, herself;



<P>cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!



<P>Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was,



<P>above all things, the most material to her interest,



<P>and such an invitation the most gratifying to her



<P>feelings!&nbsp; It was an advantage that could not be too



<P>gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of;



<P>and the visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had



<P>any precise limits, was instantly discovered to have been



<P>always meant to end in two days' time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was

within ten



<P>minutes after its arrival, it gave her, for the first time,



<P>some share in the expectations of Lucy; for such a mark



<P>of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance,



<P>seemed to declare that the good-will towards her arose



<P>from something more than merely malice against herself;



<P>and might be brought, by time and address, to do



<P>every thing that Lucy wished.&nbsp; Her flattery had already



<P>subdued the pride of Lady Middleton, and made an entry



<P>into the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood; and these



<P>were effects that laid open the probability of greater.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street,

and all



<P>that reached Elinor of their influence there, strengthened



<P>her expectation of the event.&nbsp; Sir John, who called on



<P>them more than once, brought home such accounts of the



<P>favour they were in, as must be universally striking.



<P>Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any



<P>young women in her life, as she was with them; had given



<P>each of them a needle book made by some emigrant;



<P>called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not know



<P>whether she should ever be able to part with them.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, for some time after he left her, for

some time



<P>even after the sound of his carriage had died away, remained



<P>too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas, widely differing in



<P>themselves, but of which sadness was the general result,



<P>to think even of her sister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago

she had



<P>abhorred as the most worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite



<P>of all his faults, excited a degree of commiseration



<P>for the sufferings produced by them, which made her



<P>think of him as now separated for ever from her family,



<P>with a tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she



<P>soon acknowledged within herself--to his wishes than to



<P>his merits.&nbsp; She felt that his influence over her mind



<P>was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason



<P>to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction,



<P>that open, affectionate, and lively manner which it



<P>was no merit to possess; and by that still ardent love



<P>for Marianne, which it was not even innocent to indulge.



<P>But she felt that it was so, long, long before she could



<P>feel his influence less.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When at last she returned to the unconscious

Marianne,



<P>she found her just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet



<P>a sleep to the extent of her hopes.&nbsp; Elinor's heart was full.



<P>The past, the present, the future, Willoughby's visit,



<P>Marianne's safety, and her mother's expected arrival,



<P>threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits



<P>which kept off every indication of fatigue, and made



<P>her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister.



<P>Short was the time, however, in which that fear could



<P>affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby's



<P>leaving the house, she was again called down stairs



<P>by the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her



<P>mother from every unnecessary moment's horrible suspense,



<P>she ran immediately into the hall, and reached the outward



<P>door just in time to receive and support her as she



<P>entered it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near

the



<P>house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne's



<P>being no more, had no voice to inquire after her,



<P>no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neither for



<P>salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--



<P>and her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth,



<P>was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness, as she



<P>had been before by her fears.&nbsp; She was supported into



<P>the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend;--



<P>and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable



<P>to speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her



<P>at intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look



<P>which spoke at once her gratitude, and her conviction



<P>of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment.



<P>He shared it, however, in a silence even greater than



<P>her own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself,



<P>to see Marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes she



<P>was with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever



<P>by absence, unhappiness, and danger.&nbsp; Elinor's delight,



<P>as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only checked



<P>by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;--



<P>but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent,



<P>when the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne,



<P>satisfied in knowing her mother was near her, and conscious



<P>of being too weak for conversation, submitted readily to the



<P>silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her.



<P>Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night; and Elinor,



<P>in compliance with her mother's entreaty, went to bed.



<P>But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless,



<P>and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to



<P>make requisite, was kept off by irritation of spirits.



<P>Willoughby, "poor Willoughby," as she now allowed



<P>herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she



<P>would not but have heard his vindication for the world,



<P>and now blamed, now acquitted herself for having judged him



<P>so harshly before.&nbsp; But her promise of relating it to her



<P>sister was invariably painful.&nbsp; She dreaded the performance



<P>of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be;



<P>doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever



<P>be happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby



<P>a widower.&nbsp; Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself,



<P>felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more



<P>than to his rival's, the reward of her sister was due,



<P>and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby's death.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand at Barton

had been



<P>much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm;



<P>for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne, that she



<P>had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that



<P>very day, without waiting for any further intelligence,



<P>and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,



<P>that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch



<P>Margaret away, as her mother was unwilling to take her



<P>where there might be infection.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne continued to mend every day, and the

brilliant



<P>cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved



<P>her to be, as she repeatedly declared herself, one of



<P>the happiest women in the world.&nbsp; Elinor could not hear



<P>the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes



<P>wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward.



<P>But Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account



<P>of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her,



<P>was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only



<P>of what would increase it.&nbsp; Marianne was restored to her



<P>from a danger in which, as she now began to feel,



<P>her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate



<P>attachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her;--



<P>and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy



<P>unthought of by Elinor.&nbsp; It was thus imparted to her,



<P>as soon as any opportunity of private conference between



<P>them occurred.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At last we are alone.&nbsp; My Elinor, you

do not yet



<P>know all my happiness.&nbsp; Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.



<P>He has told me so himself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her daughter, feeling by turns both pleased

and pained,



<P>surprised and not surprised, was all silent attention.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should



<P>wonder at your composure now.&nbsp; Had I sat down to wish



<P>for any possible good to my family, I should have fixed



<P>on Colonel Brandon's marrying one of you as the object



<P>most desirable.&nbsp; And I believe Marianne will be the most



<P>happy with him of the two."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason

for thinking so,



<P>because satisfied that none founded on an impartial



<P>consideration of their age, characters, or feelings,



<P>could be given;--but her mother must always be carried



<P>away by her imagination on any interesting subject,



<P>and therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He opened his whole heart to me yesterday

as we travelled.



<P>It came out quite unawares, quite undesignedly.&nbsp; I, you may



<P>well believe, could talk of nothing but my child;--he could



<P>not conceal his distress; I saw that it equalled my own,



<P>and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as the world



<P>now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy--or rather,



<P>not thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to irresistible



<P>feelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant,



<P>affection for Marianne.&nbsp; He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since



<P>the first moment of seeing her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language,



<P>not the professions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural



<P>embellishments of her mother's active fancy, which fashioned



<P>every thing delightful to her as it chose.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His regard for her, infinitely surpassing

anything



<P>that Willoughby ever felt or feigned, as much more warm,



<P>as more sincere or constant--which ever we are to call it--



<P>has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne's



<P>unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!--and



<P>without selfishness--without encouraging a hope!--could



<P>he have seen her happy with another--Such a noble mind!--



<P>such openness, such sincerity!--no one can be deceived



<P>in HIM."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Colonel Brandon's character," said Elinor,



<P>"as an excellent man, is well established."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know it is"--replied her mother seriously,

"or



<P>after such a warning, I should be the last to encourage



<P>such affection, or even to be pleased by it.&nbsp; But his coming



<P>for me as he did, with such active, such ready friendship,



<P>is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His character, however," answered Elinor,

"does not rest



<P>on ONE act of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne,



<P>were humanity out of the case, would have prompted him.



<P>To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he has been long



<P>and intimately known; they equally love and respect him;



<P>and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired,



<P>is very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him,



<P>that if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready



<P>as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing



<P>to us in the world.&nbsp; What answer did you give him?--Did you



<P>allow him to hope?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope

to him



<P>or to myself.&nbsp; Marianne might at that moment be dying.



<P>But he did not ask for hope or encouragement.&nbsp; His was



<P>an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible effusion



<P>to a soothing friend--not an application to a parent.



<P>Yet after a time I DID say, for at first I was quite



<P>overcome--that if she lived, as I trusted she might,



<P>my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage;



<P>and since our arrival, since our delightful security,



<P>I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every



<P>encouragement in my power.&nbsp; Time, a very little time,



<P>I tell him, will do everything;--Marianne's heart is



<P>not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.--



<P>His own merits must soon secure it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To judge from the Colonel's spirits, however,



<P>you have not yet made him equally sanguine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No.--He thinks Marianne's affection too deeply



<P>rooted for any change in it under a great length of time,



<P>and even supposing her heart again free, is too diffident



<P>of himself to believe, that with such a difference of age



<P>and disposition he could ever attach her.&nbsp; There, however,



<P>he is quite mistaken.&nbsp; His age is only so much beyond



<P>hers as to be an advantage, as to make his character and



<P>principles fixed;--and his disposition, I am well convinced,



<P>is exactly the very one to make your sister happy.



<P>And his person, his manners too, are all in his favour.



<P>My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not



<P>so handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time,



<P>there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.--



<P>There was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby's



<P>eyes at times, which I did not like."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother,



<P>without waiting for her assent, continued,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And his manners, the Colonel's manners are

not only



<P>more pleasing to me than Willoughby's ever were, but they



<P>are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching



<P>to Marianne.&nbsp; Their gentleness, their genuine attention



<P>to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity



<P>is much more accordant with her real disposition, than



<P>the liveliness--often artificial, and often ill-timed



<P>of the other.&nbsp; I am very sure myself, that had Willoughby



<P>turned out as really amiable, as he has proved himself



<P>the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy



<P>with HIM, as she will be with Colonel Brandon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree



<P>with her, but her dissent was not heard, and therefore



<P>gave no offence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance

of me,"



<P>added Mrs. Dashwood, "even if I remain at Barton; and in all



<P>probability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there



<P>certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by,



<P>that would suit us quite as well as our present situation."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting



<P>her to Delaford!--but her spirit was stubborn.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His fortune too!--for at my time of life you

know,



<P>everybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know



<P>nor desire to know, what it really is, I am sure it must be



<P>a good one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here they were interrupted by the entrance

of a



<P>third person, and Elinor withdrew to think it all over



<P>in private, to wish success to her friend, and yet



<P>in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, starting back with a look of horror

at



<P>the sight of him, obeyed the first impulse of her heart



<P>in turning instantly to quit the room, and her hand



<P>was already on the lock, when its action was suspended



<P>by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather



<P>of command than supplication,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--



<P>I entreat you to stay."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, sir," she replied with firmness, "I shall

NOT stay.



<P>Your business cannot be with ME.&nbsp; The servants, I suppose,



<P>forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Had they told me," he cried with vehemence,



<P>"that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil,



<P>it would not have turned me from the door.&nbsp; My business



<P>is with you, and only you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With me!"--in the utmost amazement--"well,

sir,--



<P>be quick--and if you can--less violent."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sit down, and I will be both."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hesitated; she knew not what to do.&nbsp;

The possibility



<P>of Colonel Brandon's arriving and finding her there,



<P>came across her.&nbsp; But she had promised to hear him,



<P>and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged.



<P>After a moment's recollection, therefore, concluding that



<P>prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would



<P>best promote it, she walked silently towards the table,



<P>and sat down.&nbsp; He took the opposite chair, and for half



<P>a minute not a word was said by either.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pray be quick, sir,"--said Elinor, impatiently;--



<P>"I have no time to spare."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation,



<P>and seemed not to hear her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your sister," said he, with abruptness, a

moment



<P>afterwards--"is out of danger.&nbsp; I heard it from the servant.



<P>God be praised!--But is it true? is it really true?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor would not speak.&nbsp; He repeated the

inquiry



<P>with yet greater eagerness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For God's sake tell me, is she out of danger,



<P>or is she not?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We hope she is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rose up, and walked across the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Had I known as much half an hour ago--But



<P>since I AM here,"--speaking with a forced vivacity as he



<P>returned to his seat--"what does it signify?--For once,



<P>Miss Dashwood--it will be the last time, perhaps--let us



<P>be cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for gaiety.--



<P>Tell me honestly"--a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks--



<P>"do you think me most a knave or a fool?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment

than ever.



<P>She began to think that be must be in liquor;--the



<P>strangeness of such a visit, and of such manners,



<P>seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this impression



<P>she immediately rose, saying,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to

return



<P>to Combe--I am not at leisure to remain with you longer.--



<P>Whatever your business may be with me, will it be better



<P>recollected and explained to-morrow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand you," he replied, with an expressive

smile,



<P>and a voice perfectly calm; "yes, I am very drunk.--



<P>A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was



<P>enough to over-set me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At Marlborough!"--cried Elinor, more and more

at



<P>a loss to understand what he would be at.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes,--I left London this morning at eight

o'clock,



<P>and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise



<P>since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence



<P>of his eye as he spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever



<P>other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland,



<P>he was not brought there by intoxication, she said,



<P>after a moment's recollection,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly



<P>DO--that after what has passed--your coming here in



<P>this manner, and forcing yourself upon my notice,



<P>requires a very particular excuse.--What is it,



<P>that you mean by it?"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I mean,"--said he, with serious energy--"if

I can,



<P>to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW.



<P>I mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind



<P>of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you,



<P>and by convincing you, that though I have been always



<P>a blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain



<P>something like forgiveness from Ma--from your sister."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the real reason of your coming?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my soul it is,"--was his answer, with

a warmth



<P>which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance,



<P>and in spite of herself made her think him sincere.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If that is all, you may be satisfied already,--



<P>for Marianne DOES--she has LONG forgiven you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Has she?"--he cried, in the same eager tone.--



<P>"Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it.



<P>But she shall forgive me again, and on more reasonable



<P>grounds.--NOW will you listen to me?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor bowed her assent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not know," said he, after a pause of

expectation



<P>on her side, and thoughtfulness on his own,--"how YOU



<P>may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister,



<P>or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me.--



<P>Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is



<P>worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing.



<P>When I first became intimate in your family, I had no



<P>other intention, no other view in the acquaintance



<P>than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain



<P>in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.



<P>Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners



<P>could not but please me; and her behaviour to me almost



<P>from the first, was of a kind--It is astonishing,



<P>when I reflect on what it was, and what SHE was, that my



<P>heart should have been so insensible!&nbsp; But at first



<P>I must confess, my vanity only was elevated by it.



<P>Careless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement,



<P>giving way to feelings which I had always been too much



<P>in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every means



<P>in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any



<P>design of returning her affection."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes

on him



<P>with the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby,



<P>for you to relate, or for me to listen any longer.



<P>Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing.--



<P>Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on



<P>the subject."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I insist on you hearing the whole of it,"

he replied,



<P>"My fortune was never large, and I had always been expensive,



<P>always in the habit of associating with people of better



<P>income than myself.&nbsp; Every year since my coming of age,



<P>or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and though



<P>the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free;



<P>yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant,



<P>it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my



<P>circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune.&nbsp; To attach



<P>myself to your sister, therefore, was not a thing to be



<P>thought of;--and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty--



<P>which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours,



<P>Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I was acting



<P>in this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a



<P>thought of returning it.--But one thing may be said



<P>for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity,



<P>I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated,



<P>because I did not THEN know what it was to love.



<P>But have I ever known it?--Well may it be doubted; for, had I



<P>really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity,



<P>to avarice?--or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?--



<P>But I have done it.&nbsp; To avoid a comparative poverty,



<P>which her affection and her society would have deprived



<P>of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence,



<P>lost every thing that could make it a blessing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You did then," said Elinor, a little softened,



<P>"believe yourself at one time attached to her?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To have resisted such attractions, to have

withstood



<P>such tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have



<P>done it?--Yes, I found myself, by insensible degrees,



<P>sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my life



<P>were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions



<P>were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.



<P>Even THEN, however, when fully determined on paying



<P>my addresses to her, I allowed myself most improperly



<P>to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it,



<P>from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement



<P>while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed.



<P>I will not reason here--nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate



<P>on the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of scrupling



<P>to engage my faith where my honour was already bound.



<P>The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool,



<P>providing with great circumspection for a possible



<P>opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched



<P>for ever.&nbsp; At last, however, my resolution was taken,



<P>and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone,



<P>to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her,



<P>and openly assure her of an affection which I had already



<P>taken such pains to display.&nbsp; But in the interim--in the



<P>interim of the very few hours that were to pass, before I



<P>could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private--



<P>a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin



<P>all my resolution, and with it all my comfort.&nbsp; A discovery



<P>took place,"--here he hesitated and looked down.--"Mrs. Smith



<P>had somehow or other been informed, I imagine by some



<P>distant relation, whose interest it was to deprive me of



<P>her favour, of an affair, a connection--but I need not



<P>explain myself farther," he added, looking at her with an



<P>heightened colour and an enquiring eye--"your particular



<P>intimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long ago."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have," returned Elinor, colouring likewise,



<P>and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him,



<P>"I have heard it all.&nbsp; And how you will explain away any



<P>part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess



<P>is beyond my comprehension."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember," cried Willoughby, "from whom you

received



<P>the account.&nbsp; Could it be an impartial one?&nbsp; I acknowledge



<P>that her situation and her character ought to have been



<P>respected by me.&nbsp; I do not mean to justify myself, but at



<P>the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing



<P>to urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,



<P>and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.



<P>If the violence of her passions, the weakness of her



<P>understanding--I do not mean, however, to defend myself.



<P>Her affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often,



<P>with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which,



<P>for a very short time, had the power of creating any return.



<P>I wish--I heartily wish it had never been.&nbsp; But I have injured



<P>more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection



<P>for me--(may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers;



<P>and whose mind--Oh! how infinitely superior!"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate



<P>girl--I must say it, unpleasant to me as the discussion



<P>of such a subject may well be--your indifference is no



<P>apology for your cruel neglect of her.&nbsp; Do not think yourself



<P>excused by any weakness, any natural defect of understanding



<P>on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.



<P>You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself



<P>in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay,



<P>always happy, she was reduced to the extremest indigence."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it," he

warmly



<P>replied; "I did not recollect that I had omitted to give



<P>her my direction; and common sense might have told her



<P>how to find it out."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She taxed me with the offence at once, and

my confusion



<P>may be guessed.&nbsp; The purity of her life, the formality



<P>of her notions, her ignorance of the world--every thing



<P>was against me.&nbsp; The matter itself I could not deny,



<P>and vain was every endeavour to soften it.&nbsp; She was



<P>previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my



<P>conduct in general, and was moreover discontented with



<P>the very little attention, the very little portion of my



<P>time that I had bestowed on her, in my present visit.



<P>In short, it ended in a total breach.&nbsp; By one measure I



<P>might have saved myself.&nbsp; In the height of her morality,



<P>good woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would



<P>marry Eliza.&nbsp; That could not be--and I was formally



<P>dismissed from her favour and her house.&nbsp; The night



<P>following this affair--I was to go the next morning--



<P>was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct



<P>should be.&nbsp; The struggle was great--but it ended too soon.



<P>My affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her



<P>attachment to me--it was all insufficient to outweigh



<P>that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false



<P>ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally



<P>inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased.



<P>I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife,



<P>if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself to think



<P>that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do.



<P>A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave



<P>Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day;



<P>some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking



<P>this engagement.&nbsp; But whether I should write this apology,



<P>or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate.



<P>To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted



<P>whether I could see her again, and keep to my resolution.



<P>In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,



<P>as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw



<P>her miserable, and left her miserable--and left her hoping



<P>never to see her again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?" said Elinor,



<P>reproachfully; "a note would have answered every purpose.--



<P>Why was it necessary to call?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was necessary to my own pride.&nbsp; I

could not bear



<P>to leave the country in a manner that might lead you,



<P>or the rest of the neighbourhood, to suspect any part



<P>of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself--



<P>and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage,



<P>in my way to Honiton.&nbsp; The sight of your dear sister,



<P>however, was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter,



<P>I found her alone.&nbsp; You were all gone I do not know where.



<P>I had left her only the evening before, so fully,



<P>so firmly resolved within my self on doing right!



<P>A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever;



<P>and I remember how happy, how gay were my spirits, as I



<P>walked from the cottage to Allenham, satisfied with myself,



<P>delighted with every body!&nbsp; But in this, our last interview



<P>of friendship, I approached her with a sense of guilt



<P>that almost took from me the power of dissembling.



<P>Her sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told



<P>her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I



<P>never shall forget it--united too with such reliance,



<P>such confidence in me!--Oh, God!--what a hard-hearted rascal



<P>I was!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were both silent for a few moments.



<P>Elinor first spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you tell her that you should soon return?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not know what I told her," he replied,

impatiently;



<P>"less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all



<P>likelihood much more than was justified by the future.



<P>I cannot think of it.--It won't do.--Then came your dear mother



<P>to torture me farther, with all her kindness and confidence.



<P>Thank Heaven! it DID torture me.&nbsp; I was miserable.



<P>Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it



<P>gives me to look back on my own misery.&nbsp; I owe such a grudge



<P>to myself for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart,



<P>that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and



<P>exultation to me now.&nbsp; Well, I went, left all that I loved,



<P>and went to those to whom, at best, I was only indifferent.



<P>My journey to town--travelling with my own horses,



<P>and therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my



<P>own reflections so cheerful--when I looked forward



<P>every thing so inviting!--when I looked back at Barton,



<P>the picture so soothing!--oh, it was a blessed journey!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopped.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, sir," said Elinor, who, though pitying

him,



<P>grew impatient for his departure, "and this is all?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?--



<P>That infamous letter--Did she shew it you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I saw every note that passed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately

did,



<P>for I was in town the whole time,) what I felt is--



<P>in the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more



<P>simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any emotion--



<P>my feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every word



<P>was--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer,



<P>were she here, would forbid--a dagger to my heart.



<P>To know that Marianne was in town was--in the same language--



<P>a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof



<P>would she have given me!--her taste, her opinions--I believe



<P>they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure



<P>they are dearer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes



<P>in the course of this extraordinary conversation,



<P>was now softened again;--yet she felt it her duty to check



<P>such ideas in her companion as the last.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember

that



<P>you are married.&nbsp; Relate only what in your conscience



<P>you think necessary for me to hear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marianne's note, by assuring me that I was

still



<P>as dear to her as in former days, that in spite of the many,



<P>many weeks we had been separated, she was as constant



<P>in her own feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy



<P>of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.&nbsp; I say awakened,



<P>because time and London, business and dissipation,



<P>had in some measure quieted it, and I had been growing



<P>a fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her,



<P>and chusing to fancy that she too must have become



<P>indifferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment



<P>as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my shoulders



<P>in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,



<P>overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then,



<P>'I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married.'--



<P>But this note made me know myself better.&nbsp; I felt that



<P>she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman



<P>in the world, and that I was using her infamously.



<P>But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey



<P>and me.&nbsp; To retreat was impossible.&nbsp; All that I had to do,



<P>was to avoid you both.&nbsp; I sent no answer to Marianne,



<P>intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice;



<P>and for some time I was even determined not to call in



<P>Berkeley Street;--but at last, judging it wiser to affect



<P>the air of a cool, common acquaintance than anything else,



<P>I watched you all safely out of the house one morning,



<P>and left my name."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Watched us out of the house!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even so.&nbsp; You would be surprised to hear

how often



<P>I watched you, how often I was on the point of falling



<P>in with you.&nbsp; I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight,



<P>as the carriage drove by.&nbsp; Lodging as I did in Bond Street,



<P>there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse



<P>of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant



<P>watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing



<P>desire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us



<P>so long.&nbsp; I avoided the Middletons as much as possible,



<P>as well as everybody else who was likely to prove



<P>an acquaintance in common.&nbsp; Not aware of their being



<P>in town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe,



<P>the first day of his coming, and the day after I had called



<P>at Mrs. Jennings's.&nbsp; He asked me to a party, a dance at his



<P>house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement



<P>that you and your sister were to be there, I should have



<P>felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him.



<P>The next morning brought another short note from Marianne--



<P>still affectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything



<P>that could make MY conduct most hateful.&nbsp; I could not



<P>answer it.&nbsp; I tried--but could not frame a sentence.



<P>But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day.



<P>If you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it



<P>was THEN.&nbsp; With my head and heart full of your sister,



<P>I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--Those



<P>three or four weeks were worse than all.&nbsp; Well, at last,



<P>as I need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what a



<P>sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!--



<P>Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me



<P>Willoughby in such a tone!--Oh, God!--holding out her hand



<P>to me, asking me for an explanation, with those bewitching



<P>eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--and



<P>Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other hand, looking



<P>all that was--Well, it does not signify; it is over now.--



<P>Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could;



<P>but not before I had seen Marianne's sweet face as white



<P>as death.--THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;--



<P>the last manner in which she appeared to me.&nbsp; It was a horrid



<P>sight!--yet when I thought of her to-day as really dying,



<P>it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew



<P>exactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last



<P>in this world.&nbsp; She was before me, constantly before me,



<P>as I travelled, in the same look and hue."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded.



<P>Willoughby first rousing himself, broke it thus:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let me make haste and be gone.&nbsp;

Your sister



<P>is certainly better, certainly out of danger?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are assured of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your poor mother, too!--doting on Marianne."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter;



<P>have you any thing to say about that?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes, THAT in particular.&nbsp; Your sister



<P>wrote to me again, you know, the very next morning.



<P>You saw what she said.&nbsp; I was breakfasting at the



<P>Ellisons,--and her letter, with some others, was brought



<P>to me there from my lodgings.&nbsp; It happened to catch



<P>Sophia's eye before it caught mine--and its size,



<P>the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether,



<P>immediately gave her a suspicion.&nbsp; Some vague report had



<P>reached her before of my attachment to some young lady



<P>in Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation



<P>the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was,



<P>and made her more jealous than ever.&nbsp; Affecting that air



<P>of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman



<P>one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read



<P>its contents.&nbsp; She was well paid for her impudence.



<P>She read what made her wretched.&nbsp; Her wretchedness I could



<P>have borne, but her passion--her malice--At all events it



<P>must be appeased.&nbsp; And, in short--what do you think of my



<P>wife's style of letter-writing?--delicate--tender--



<P>truly feminine--was it not?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand-writing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely

copying



<P>such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to.



<P>The original was all her own--her own happy thoughts



<P>and gentle diction.&nbsp; But what could I do!--we were engaged,



<P>every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But I am



<P>talking like a fool.&nbsp; Preparation!--day!--In honest words,



<P>her money was necessary to me, and in a situation like



<P>mine, any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture.



<P>And after all, what did it signify to my character



<P>in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language



<P>my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end.



<P>My business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether



<P>I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.--



<P>'I am ruined for ever in their opinion--' said I to



<P>myself--'I am shut out for ever from their society,



<P>they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter



<P>will only make them think me a blackguard one.' Such were



<P>my reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness,



<P>I copied my wife's words, and parted with the last relics



<P>of Marianne.&nbsp; Her three notes--unluckily they were all



<P>in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their existence,



<P>and hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put them up,



<P>and could not even kiss them.&nbsp; And the lock of hair--that too



<P>I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book,



<P>which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating



<P>virulence,--the dear lock--all, every memento was torn



<P>from me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,"



<P>said Elinor, while her voice, in spite of herself,



<P>betrayed her compassionate emotion; "you ought not to speak



<P>in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister.



<P>You had made your own choice.&nbsp; It was not forced on you.



<P>Your wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect,



<P>at least.&nbsp; She must be attached to you, or she would not



<P>have married you.&nbsp; To treat her with unkindness, to speak



<P>of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne--nor can I



<P>suppose it a relief to your own conscience."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not talk to me of my wife," said he with

a heavy sigh.--



<P>"She does not deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no



<P>regard for her when we married.--Well, married we were,



<P>and came down to Combe Magna to be happy, and afterwards



<P>returned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity me,



<P>Miss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?--



<P>Am I--be it only one degree--am I less guilty in your opinion



<P>than I was before?--My intentions were not always wrong.



<P>Have I explained away any part of my guilt?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you have certainly removed something--a

little.--



<P>You have proved yourself, on the whole, less faulty than I



<P>had believed you.&nbsp; You have proved your heart less wicked,



<P>much less wicked.&nbsp; But I hardly know--the misery that



<P>you have inflicted--I hardly know what could have made



<P>it worse."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will you repeat to your sister when she is

recovered,



<P>what I have been telling you?--Let me be a little lightened



<P>too in her opinion as well as in yours.&nbsp; You tell me that



<P>she has forgiven me already.&nbsp; Let me be able to fancy that



<P>a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present feelings,



<P>will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more



<P>gentle, less dignified, forgiveness.&nbsp; Tell her of my misery



<P>and my penitence--tell her that my heart was never inconstant



<P>to her, and if you will, that at this moment she is dearer



<P>to me than ever."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will tell her all that is necessary to what

may



<P>comparatively be called, your justification.&nbsp; But you have



<P>not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now,



<P>nor how you heard of her illness."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against

Sir



<P>John Middleton, and when he saw who I was--for the first



<P>time these two months--he spoke to me.--That he had cut



<P>me ever since my marriage, I had seen without surprise



<P>or resentment.&nbsp; Now, however, his good-natured, honest,



<P>stupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern



<P>for your sister, could not resist the temptation of telling



<P>me what he knew ought to--though probably he did not



<P>think it WOULD--vex me horridly.&nbsp; As bluntly as he could



<P>speak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne Dashwood



<P>was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a letter that



<P>morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger



<P>most imminent--the Palmers are all gone off in a fright,



<P>&amp;c.--I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself



<P>off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John.



<P>His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much



<P>of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted,



<P>he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an



<P>old promise about a pointer puppy.&nbsp; What I felt on hearing



<P>that your sister was dying--and dying too, believing me



<P>the greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me



<P>in her latest moments--for how could I tell what horrid



<P>projects might not have been imputed?&nbsp; ONE person I



<P>was sure would represent me as capable of any thing--



<P>What I felt was dreadful!--My resolution was soon made,



<P>and at eight o'clock this morning I was in my carriage.



<P>Now you know all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor made no answer.&nbsp; Her thoughts were

silently fixed



<P>on the irreparable injury which too early an independence



<P>and its consequent habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury,



<P>had made in the mind, the character, the happiness,



<P>of a man who, to every advantage of person and talents,



<P>united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a



<P>feeling, affectionate temper.&nbsp; The world had made him



<P>extravagant and vain--Extravagance and vanity had made him



<P>cold-hearted and selfish.&nbsp; Vanity, while seeking its own



<P>guilty triumph at the expense of another, had involved



<P>him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least



<P>its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed.



<P>Each faulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led



<P>him likewise to punishment.&nbsp; The attachment, from which



<P>against honour, against feeling, against every better interest



<P>he had outwardly torn himself, now, when no longer allowable,



<P>governed every thought; and the connection, for the sake



<P>of which he had, with little scruple, left her sister



<P>to misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness



<P>to himself of a far more incurable nature.&nbsp; From a reverie



<P>of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes



<P>by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie at least



<P>equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no use in staying here; I must be

off."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you going back to town?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No--to Combe Magna.&nbsp; I have business

there;



<P>from thence to town in a day or two.&nbsp; Good bye."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He held out his hand.&nbsp; She could not refuse

to give



<P>him hers's;--he pressed it with affection.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you DO think something better of me than



<P>you did?"--said he, letting it fall, and leaning against



<P>the mantel-piece as if forgetting he was to go.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor assured him that she did;--that she

forgave,



<P>pitied, wished him well--was even interested in his



<P>happiness--and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour



<P>most likely to promote it.&nbsp; His answer was not very encouraging.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As to that," said he, "I must rub through

the world



<P>as well as I can.&nbsp; Domestic happiness is out of the question.



<P>If, however, I am allowed to think that you and yours feel



<P>an interest in my fate and actions, it may be the means--it



<P>may put me on my guard--at least, it may be something to



<P>live for.&nbsp; Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.



<P>Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor stopped him with a reproof.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well,"--he replied--"once more good bye. I

shall



<P>now go away and live in dread of one event."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your sister's marriage."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very wrong.&nbsp; She can never be

more lost



<P>to you than she is now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she will be gained by some one else.&nbsp;

And if



<P>that some one should be the very he whom, of all others,



<P>I could least bear--but I will not stay to rob myself



<P>of all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing



<P>that where I have most injured I can least forgive.



<P>Good bye,--God bless you!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with these words, he almost ran out of

the room.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs.

Ferrars,



<P>just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that



<P>reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring,



<P>the reproach of being too amiable, Edward was admitted



<P>to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.



<P>For many years of her life she had had two sons;



<P>but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago,



<P>had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of Robert



<P>had left her for a fortnight without any; and now,



<P>by the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of his being allowed once more to

live,



<P>however, he did not feel the continuance of his existence



<P>secure, till he had revealed his present engagement;



<P>for the publication of that circumstance, he feared,



<P>might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry



<P>him off as rapidly as before.&nbsp; With apprehensive caution



<P>therefore it was revealed, and he was listened to with



<P>unexpected calmness.&nbsp; Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably



<P>endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood,



<P>by every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss Morton



<P>he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--



<P>and enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton



<P>was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds,



<P>while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private



<P>gentleman with no more than THREE; but when she found that,



<P>though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation,



<P>he was by no means inclined to be guided by it,



<P>she judged it wisest, from the experience of the past,



<P>to submit--and therefore, after such an ungracious delay



<P>as she owed to her own dignity, and as served to prevent



<P>every suspicion of good-will, she issued her decree



<P>of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What she would engage to do towards augmenting



<P>their income was next to be considered; and here it



<P>plainly appeared, that though Edward was now her only son,



<P>he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was



<P>inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year,



<P>not the smallest objection was made against Edward's taking



<P>orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost;



<P>nor was anything promised either for the present or in future,



<P>beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had been given with Fanny.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was as much, however, as was desired,



<P>and more than was expected, by Edward and Elinor;



<P>and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,



<P>seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With an income quite sufficient to their wants



<P>thus secured to them, they had nothing to wait for



<P>after Edward was in possession of the living, but the



<P>readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon,



<P>with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor,



<P>was making considerable improvements; and after waiting



<P>some time for their completion, after experiencing,



<P>as usual, a thousand disappointments and delays



<P>from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,



<P>as usual, broke through the first positive resolution



<P>of not marrying till every thing was ready, and the



<P>ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first month after their marriage was spent



<P>with their friend at the Mansion-house; from whence



<P>they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage,



<P>and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--



<P>could chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.



<P>Mrs. Jennings's prophecies, though rather jumbled together,



<P>were chiefly fulfilled; for she was able to visit Edward



<P>and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she



<P>found in Elinor and her husband, as she really believed,



<P>one of the happiest couples in the world.&nbsp; They had



<P>in fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel



<P>Brandon and Marianne, and rather better pasturage for



<P>their cows.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were visited on their first settling by

almost



<P>all their relations and friends.&nbsp; Mrs. Ferrars came



<P>to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed



<P>of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at



<P>the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will not say that I am disappointed, my

dear sister,"



<P>said John, as they were walking together one morning before



<P>the gates of Delaford House, "THAT would be saying too much,



<P>for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young



<P>women in the world, as it is.&nbsp; But, I confess, it would



<P>give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother.



<P>His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in



<P>such respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I



<P>have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there



<P>is now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps,



<P>Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him--



<P>yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to



<P>have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel



<P>Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what



<P>may happen--for, when people are much thrown together,



<P>and see little of anybody else--and it will always be



<P>in your power to set her off to advantage, and so forth;--



<P>in short, you may as well give her a chance--You understand me."--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them,

and always



<P>treated them with the make-believe of decent affection,



<P>they were never insulted by her real favour and preference.



<P>THAT was due to the folly of Robert, and the cunning



<P>of his wife; and it was earned by them before many months



<P>had passed away.&nbsp; The selfish sagacity of the latter,



<P>which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape,



<P>was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it;



<P>for her respectful humility, assiduous attentions,



<P>and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening



<P>was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars



<P>to his choice, and re-established him completely in



<P>her favour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair,



<P>and the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may be held



<P>forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest,



<P>an unceasing attention to self-interest, however its progress



<P>may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every



<P>advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time



<P>and conscience.&nbsp; When Robert first sought her acquaintance,



<P>and privately visited her in Bartlett's Buildings,



<P>it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother.



<P>He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement;



<P>and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection



<P>of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews



<P>would settle the matter.&nbsp; In that point, however,



<P>and that only, he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him



<P>hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME,



<P>another visit, another conversation, was always wanted



<P>to produce this conviction.&nbsp; Some doubts always lingered



<P>in her mind when they parted, which could only be



<P>removed by another half hour's discourse with himself.



<P>His attendance was by this means secured, and the rest



<P>followed in course.&nbsp; Instead of talking of Edward,



<P>they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject



<P>on which he had always more to say than on any other,



<P>and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal



<P>to his own; and in short, it became speedily evident



<P>to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.



<P>He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward,



<P>and very proud of marrying privately without his



<P>mother's consent.&nbsp; What immediately followed is known.



<P>They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish;



<P>for she had many relations and old acquaintances to



<P>cut--and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--



<P>and from thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness



<P>of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it,



<P>which, at Lucy's instigation, was adopted.&nbsp; The forgiveness,



<P>at first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert;



<P>and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore



<P>could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks



<P>longer unpardoned.&nbsp; But perseverance in humility of conduct



<P>and messages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence,



<P>and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with,



<P>procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame



<P>her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid



<P>degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.



<P>Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert



<P>or Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven



<P>for having once intended to marry her, and Elinor,



<P>though superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken



<P>of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered,



<P>and always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.



<P>They settled in town, received very liberal assistance



<P>from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable



<P>with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies



<P>and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,



<P>in which their husbands of course took a part, as well



<P>as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and



<P>Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which



<P>they all lived together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Edward had done to forfeit the right of

eldest



<P>son, might have puzzled many people to find out; and what



<P>Robert had done to succeed to it, might have puzzled them



<P>still more.&nbsp; It was an arrangement, however, justified in



<P>its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever



<P>appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give



<P>a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income,



<P>as either leaving his brother too little, or bringing



<P>himself too much;--and if Edward might be judged from



<P>the ready discharge of his duties in every particular,



<P>from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home,



<P>and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits,



<P>he might be supposed no less contented with his lot,



<P>no less free from every wish of an exchange.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's marriage divided her as little from

her



<P>family as could well be contrived, without rendering



<P>the cottage at Barton entirely useless, for her mother



<P>and sisters spent much more than half their time with her.



<P>Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well



<P>as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford;



<P>for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together



<P>was hardly less earnest, though rather more liberal than



<P>what John had expressed.&nbsp; It was now her darling object.



<P>Precious as was the company of her daughter to her,



<P>she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant



<P>enjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at



<P>the mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor.



<P>They each felt his sorrows, and their own obligations,



<P>and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the reward



<P>of all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a confederacy against her--with a

knowledge



<P>so intimate of his goodness--with a conviction of his fond



<P>attachment to herself, which at last, though long after it



<P>was observable to everybody else--burst on her--what could she do?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary

fate.



<P>She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions,



<P>and to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims.



<P>She was born to overcome an affection formed so late



<P>in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment



<P>superior to strong esteem and lively friendship,



<P>voluntarily to give her hand to another!--and THAT other,



<P>a man who had suffered no less than herself under the



<P>event of a former attachment, whom, two years before,



<P>she had considered too old to be married,--and who still



<P>sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But so it was.&nbsp; Instead of falling a sacrifice



<P>to an irresistible passion, as once she had fondly



<P>flattered herself with expecting,--instead of remaining



<P>even for ever with her mother, and finding her only



<P>pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her



<P>more calm and sober judgment she had determined on,--



<P>she found herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments,



<P>entering on new duties, placed in a new home, a wife,



<P>the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those

who best



<P>loved him, believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he



<P>was consoled for every past affliction;--her regard and her



<P>society restored his mind to animation, and his spirits



<P>to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own happiness



<P>in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight



<P>of each observing friend.&nbsp; Marianne could never love



<P>by halves; and her whole heart became, in time, as much



<P>devoted to her husband, as it had once been to Willoughby.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without



<P>a pang; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete



<P>in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating



<P>his marriage with a woman of character, as the source



<P>of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he



<P>behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have



<P>been happy and rich.&nbsp; That his repentance of misconduct,



<P>which thus brought its own punishment, was sincere,



<P>need not be doubted;--nor that he long thought of Colonel



<P>Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.&nbsp; But that



<P>he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society,



<P>or contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a



<P>broken heart, must not be depended on--for he did neither.



<P>He lived to exert, and frequently to enjoy himself.



<P>His wife was not always out of humour, nor his home



<P>always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,



<P>and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable



<P>degree of domestic felicity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Marianne, however--in spite of his incivility



<P>in surviving her loss--he always retained that decided



<P>regard which interested him in every thing that befell her,



<P>and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;--



<P>and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in



<P>after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain

at the cottage,



<P>without attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for



<P>Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them,



<P>Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing,



<P>and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between Barton and Delaford, there was that

constant



<P>communication which strong family affection would



<P>naturally dictate;--and among the merits and the happiness



<P>of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked as the least



<P>considerable, that though sisters, and living almost within



<P>sight of each other, they could live without disagreement



<P>between themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's illness, though weakening in its

kind,



<P>had not been long enough to make her recovery slow;



<P>and with youth, natural strength, and her mother's presence



<P>in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove,



<P>within four days after the arrival of the latter,



<P>into Mrs. Palmer's dressing-room.&nbsp; When there, at her own



<P>particular request, for she was impatient to pour forth



<P>her thanks to him for fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon



<P>was invited to visit her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His emotion on entering the room, in seeing

her altered



<P>looks, and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately



<P>held out to him, was such, as, in Elinor's conjecture,



<P>must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne,



<P>or the consciousness of its being known to others;



<P>and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying



<P>complexion as he looked at her sister, the probable



<P>recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind,



<P>brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza



<P>already acknowledged, and now strengthened by the hollow eye,



<P>the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,



<P>and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed

than



<P>her daughter, but with a mind very differently influenced,



<P>and therefore watching to very different effect,



<P>saw nothing in the Colonel's behaviour but what arose



<P>from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in



<P>the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself



<P>to think that something more than gratitude already dawned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of another day or two, Marianne

growing



<P>visibly stronger every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood,



<P>urged equally by her own and her daughter's wishes,



<P>began to talk of removing to Barton.&nbsp; On HER measures



<P>depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could



<P>not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel



<P>Brandon was soon brought, by their united request,



<P>to consider his own abode there as equally determinate,



<P>if not equally indispensable.&nbsp; At his and Mrs. Jennings's



<P>united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed



<P>on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back,



<P>for the better accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel,



<P>at the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings,



<P>whose active good-nature made her friendly and hospitable



<P>for other people as well as herself, engaged with pleasure



<P>to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the course



<P>of a few weeks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day of separation and departure arrived;



<P>and Marianne, after taking so particular and lengthened



<P>a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full



<P>of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart



<P>from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding



<P>Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend,



<P>was carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he



<P>seemed anxious that she should engross at least half.



<P>Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed, and the others



<P>were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers,



<P>and feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned



<P>to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid



<P>for the loss of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon



<P>immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and

Marianne



<P>bore her journey on both, without essential fatigue.



<P>Every thing that the most zealous affection, the most



<P>solicitous care could do to render her comfortable,



<P>was the office of each watchful companion, and each



<P>found their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness



<P>of spirits.&nbsp; To Elinor, the observation of the latter



<P>was particularly grateful.&nbsp; She, who had seen her week



<P>after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish



<P>of heart which she had neither courage to speak of,



<P>nor fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other



<P>could equally share, an apparent composure of mind, which,



<P>in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection,



<P>must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered



<P>on scenes of which every field and every tree brought



<P>some peculiar, some painful recollection, she grew silent



<P>and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their notice,



<P>sat earnestly gazing through the window.&nbsp; But here,



<P>Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw,



<P>as she assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she



<P>had been crying, she saw only an emotion too natural



<P>in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,



<P>and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.&nbsp; In the



<P>whole of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction



<P>of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; for no sooner



<P>had they entered their common sitting-room, than Marianne



<P>turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness,



<P>as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight



<P>of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could



<P>be connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed



<P>at cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her,



<P>it never passed away without the atonement of a smile.



<P>After dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went to it;



<P>but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera,



<P>procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their



<P>favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name



<P>in his hand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head,



<P>put the music aside, and after running over the keys



<P>for a minute, complained of feebleness in her fingers,



<P>and closed the instrument again; declaring however



<P>with firmness as she did so, that she should in future



<P>practice much.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning produced no abatement in these



<P>happy symptoms.&nbsp; On the contrary, with a mind and body



<P>alike strengthened by rest, she looked and spoke with



<P>more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of



<P>Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party



<P>which would then be restored, of their mutual pursuits



<P>and cheerful society, as the only happiness worth a wish.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the weather is settled, and I have recovered



<P>my strength," said she, "we will take long walks together



<P>every day.&nbsp; We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down,



<P>and see how the children go on; we will walk to Sir John's



<P>new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;



<P>and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory,



<P>and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told



<P>they once reached.&nbsp; I know we shall be happy.&nbsp; I know



<P>the summer will pass happily away.&nbsp; I mean never to be



<P>later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner



<P>I shall divide every moment between music and reading.



<P>I have formed my plan, and am determined to enter on a course



<P>of serious study.&nbsp; Our own library is too well known to me,



<P>to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement.



<P>But there are many works well worth reading at the Park;



<P>and there are others of more modern production which I



<P>know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon.&nbsp; By reading only six



<P>hours a-day, I shall gain in the course of a twelve-month



<P>a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself



<P>to want."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated



<P>so nobly as this; though smiling to see the same eager



<P>fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid



<P>indolence and selfish repining, now at work in introducing



<P>excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous



<P>self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she



<P>remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled,



<P>and feared she had that to communicate which might again



<P>unsettle the mind of Marianne, and ruin at least for a time



<P>this fair prospect of busy tranquillity.&nbsp; Willing therefore



<P>to delay the evil hour, she resolved to wait till her



<P>sister's health were more secure, before she appointed it.



<P>But the resolution was made only to be broken.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne had been two or three days at home,

before



<P>the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself



<P>to venture out.&nbsp; But at last a soft, genial morning appeared;



<P>such as might tempt the daughter's wishes and the



<P>mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's arm,



<P>was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue,



<P>in the lane before the house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the

feebleness



<P>of Marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her



<P>illness required;--and they had advanced only so far



<P>beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill,



<P>the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes



<P>turned towards it, Marianne calmly said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There, exactly there,"--pointing with one

hand,



<P>"on that projecting mound,--there I fell; and there I



<P>first saw Willoughby."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice sunk with the word, but presently

reviving



<P>she added,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am thankful to find that I can look with

so little pain



<P>on the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?"--



<P>hesitatingly it was said.--"Or will it be wrong?--I can talk



<P>of it now, I hope, as I ought to do."--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor tenderly invited her to be open.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for regret," said Marianne, "I have done

with that,



<P>as far as HE is concerned.&nbsp; I do not mean to talk to you



<P>of what my feelings have been for him, but what they



<P>are NOW.--At present, if I could be satisfied on one point,



<P>if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS



<P>acting a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all,



<P>if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked



<P>as my fears have sometimes fancied him, since the story



<P>of that unfortunate girl"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stopt.&nbsp; Elinor joyfully treasured

her words



<P>as she answered,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you could be assured of that, you think

you



<P>should be easy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in

it;--



<P>for not only is it horrible to suspect a person, who has



<P>been what HE has been to ME, of such designs,--but what must



<P>it make me appear to myself?--What in a situation like mine,



<P>but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose



<P>me to"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How then," asked her sister, "would you account



<P>for his behaviour?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would suppose him,--Oh, how gladly would

I suppose



<P>him, only fickle, very, very fickle."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor said no more.&nbsp; She was debating

within herself



<P>on the eligibility of beginning her story directly,



<P>or postponing it till Marianne were in stronger health;--



<P>and they crept on for a few minutes in silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not wishing him too much good," said

Marianne



<P>at last with a sigh, "when I wish his secret reflections



<P>may be no more unpleasant than my own.&nbsp; He will suffer



<P>enough in them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you compare your conduct with his?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. I compare it with what it ought to have

been;



<P>I compare it with yours."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our situations have borne little resemblance."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have borne more than our conduct.--Do

not,



<P>my dearest Elinor, let your kindness defend what I know



<P>your judgment must censure.&nbsp; My illness has made me think--



<P>It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection.



<P>Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly



<P>able to reflect.&nbsp; I considered the past: I saw in my



<P>own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance



<P>with him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence



<P>towards myself, and want of kindness to others.



<P>I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings,



<P>and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led



<P>me to the grave.&nbsp; My illness, I well knew, had been



<P>entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my



<P>own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong.



<P>Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I



<P>did not know my danger till the danger was removed;



<P>but with such feelings as these reflections gave me,



<P>I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness



<P>of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God,



<P>and to you all, did not kill me at once.&nbsp; Had I died,--



<P>in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse,



<P>my friend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful



<P>selfishness of my latter days; who had known all the



<P>murmurings of my heart!--How should I have lived in YOUR



<P>remembrance!--My mother too! How could you have consoled



<P>her!--I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.



<P>Whenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected,



<P>or some failing indulged.&nbsp; Every body seemed injured by me.



<P>The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings,



<P>I had repaid with ungrateful contempt.&nbsp; To the Middletons,



<P>to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even,



<P>I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened



<P>against their merits, and a temper irritated by their



<P>very attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them,



<P>little as they deserve, I had given less than their due.



<P>But you,--you above all, above my mother, had been wronged



<P>by me.&nbsp; I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows;



<P>yet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion



<P>that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was



<P>before me; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate



<P>of you and your comfort?&nbsp; Did I imitate your forbearance,



<P>or lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those



<P>offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude



<P>which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--No;--



<P>not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I



<P>had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every



<P>exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow



<P>to exist but with me, regretting only THAT heart which



<P>had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for or I



<P>professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my



<P>sake."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving

spirit;



<P>and Elinor, impatient to soothe, though too honest



<P>to flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support



<P>which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved.



<P>Marianne pressed her hand and replied,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very good.--The future must be my

proof.



<P>I have laid down my plan, and if I am capable of adhering



<P>to it--my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved.



<P>They shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself.



<P>I shall now live solely for my family.&nbsp; You, my mother,



<P>and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me;



<P>you will share my affections entirely between you.



<P>>From you, from my home, I shall never again have the smallest



<P>incitement to move; and if I do mix in other society,



<P>it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled,



<P>my heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities,



<P>the lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance.



<P>As for Willoughby--to say that I shall soon or that I shall



<P>ever forget him, would be idle.&nbsp; His remembrance can be overcome



<P>by no change of circumstances or opinions.&nbsp; But it shall



<P>be regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason,



<P>by constant employment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused--and added in a low voice, "If I

could



<P>but know HIS heart, everything would become easy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting



<P>on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding



<P>her narration, without feeling at all nearer decision than



<P>at first, heard this; and perceiving that as reflection



<P>did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself



<P>leading to the fact.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She managed the recital, as she hoped, with

address;



<P>prepared her anxious listener with caution; related simply



<P>and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby



<P>grounded his apology; did justice to his repentance,



<P>and softened only his protestations of present regard.



<P>Marianne said not a word.--She trembled, her eyes



<P>were fixed on the ground, and her lips became whiter



<P>than even sickness had left them.&nbsp; A thousand inquiries



<P>sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge one.



<P>She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,



<P>unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister's, and



<P>tears covered her cheeks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards

home;



<P>and till they reached the door of the cottage,



<P>easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be



<P>though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of



<P>nothing but Willoughby, and their conversation together;



<P>and was carefully minute in every particular of speech



<P>and look, where minuteness could be safely indulged.



<P>As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a kiss



<P>of gratitude and these two words just articulate through



<P>her tears, "Tell mama," withdrew from her sister and



<P>walked slowly up stairs.&nbsp; Elinor would not attempt



<P>to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought;



<P>and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its result,



<P>and a resolution of reviving the subject again,



<P>should Marianne fail to do it, she turned into the parlour



<P>to fulfill her parting injunction.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication



<P>of her former favourite.&nbsp; She rejoiced in his being



<P>cleared from some part of his imputed guilt;--she was



<P>sorry for him;--she wished him happy.&nbsp; But the feelings



<P>of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore



<P>him with a faith unbroken--a character unblemished,



<P>to Marianne.&nbsp; Nothing could do away the knowledge



<P>of what the latter had suffered through his means,



<P>nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza.



<P>Nothing could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem,



<P>nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard

Willoughby's



<P>story from himself--had she witnessed his distress,



<P>and been under the influence of his countenance and his



<P>manner, it is probable that her compassion would have



<P>been greater.&nbsp; But it was neither in Elinor's power,



<P>nor in her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her



<P>retailed explanation, as had at first been called forth



<P>in herself.&nbsp; Reflection had given calmness to her judgment,



<P>and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby's deserts;--



<P>she wished, therefore, to declare only the simple truth,



<P>and lay open such facts as were really due to his character,



<P>without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the



<P>fancy astray.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening, when they were all three together,



<P>Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;--



<P>but that it was not without an effort, the restless,



<P>unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time



<P>previously sitting--her rising colour, as she spoke,--



<P>and her unsteady voice, plainly shewed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish to assure you both," said she, "that

I see



<P>every thing--as you can desire me to do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly



<P>with soothing tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished



<P>to hear her sister's unbiased opinion, by an eager sign,



<P>engaged her silence.&nbsp; Marianne slowly continued--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told



<P>me this morning--I have now heard exactly what I



<P>wished to hear."--For some moments her voice was lost;



<P>but recovering herself, she added, and with greater



<P>calmness than before--"I am now perfectly satisfied,



<P>I wish for no change.&nbsp; I never could have been happy



<P>with him, after knowing, as sooner or later I must



<P>have known, all this.--I should have had no confidence,



<P>no esteem.&nbsp; Nothing could have done it away to my feelings."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know it--I know it," cried her mother.



<P>"Happy with a man of libertine practices!--With one



<P>who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends,



<P>and the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heart



<P>to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her



<P>sensitive counscience, would have felt all that the



<P>conscience of her husband ought to have felt."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne sighed, and repeated, "I wish for

no change."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You consider the matter," said Elinor, "exactly

as



<P>a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it;



<P>and I dare say you perceive, as well as myself, not only



<P>in this, but in many other circumstances, reason enough



<P>to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you



<P>in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which



<P>you would have been poorly supported by an affection,



<P>on his side, much less certain.&nbsp; Had you married,



<P>you must have been always poor.&nbsp; His expensiveness is



<P>acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares



<P>that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him.



<P>His demands and your inexperience together, on a small,



<P>very small income, must have brought on distresses which



<P>would not be the LESS grievous to you, from having been



<P>entirely unknown and unthought of before.&nbsp; YOUR sense



<P>of honour and honesty would have led you, I know,



<P>when aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy



<P>that would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long



<P>as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,



<P>you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--



<P>and how little could the utmost of your single management



<P>do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?--



<P>Beyond THAT, had you endeavoured, however reasonably,



<P>to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead



<P>of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it,



<P>you would have lessened your own influence on his heart,



<P>and made him regret the connection which had involved him



<P>in such difficulties?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's lips quivered, and she repeated

the word



<P>"Selfish?" in a tone that implied--"do you really think



<P>him selfish?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The whole of his behaviour," replied Elinor,



<P>"from the beginning to the end of the affair, has been



<P>grounded on selfishness.&nbsp; It was selfishness which first



<P>made him sport with your affections; which afterwards,



<P>when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession



<P>of it, and which finally carried him from Barton.



<P>His own enjoyment, or his own ease, was, in every particular,



<P>his ruling principle."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is very true.&nbsp; MY happiness never

was his object."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At present," continued Elinor, "he regrets

what he



<P>has done.&nbsp; And why does he regret it?--Because he finds



<P>it has not answered towards himself.&nbsp; It has not made



<P>him happy.&nbsp; His circumstances are now unembarrassed--he



<P>suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only



<P>that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper



<P>than yourself.&nbsp; But does it follow that had he married you,



<P>he would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have



<P>been different.&nbsp; He would then have suffered under the



<P>pecuniary distresses which, because they are removed,



<P>he now reckons as nothing.&nbsp; He would have had a wife



<P>of whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would



<P>have been always necessitous--always poor; and probably



<P>would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts



<P>of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance,



<P>even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have not a doubt of it," said Marianne;

"and I



<P>have nothing to regret--nothing but my own folly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rather say your mother's imprudence, my child,"



<P>said Mrs. Dashwood; "SHE must be answerable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor,



<P>satisfied that each felt their own error, wished to avoid



<P>any survey of the past that might weaken her sister's



<P>spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first subject,



<P>immediately continued,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn

from



<P>the whole of the story--that all Willoughby's difficulties



<P>have arisen from the first offence against virtue, in his



<P>behaviour to Eliza Williams.&nbsp; That crime has been the origin



<P>of every lesser one, and of all his present discontents."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark;



<P>and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel



<P>Brandon's injuries and merits, warm as friendship



<P>and design could unitedly dictate.&nbsp; Her daughter did



<P>not look, however, as if much of it were heard by her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on

the two



<P>or three following days, that Marianne did not continue



<P>to gain strength as she had done; but while her resolution



<P>was unsubdued, and she still tried to appear cheerful



<P>and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect



<P>of time upon her health.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret returned, and the family were again

all



<P>restored to each other, again quietly settled at the cottage;



<P>and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite



<P>so much vigour as when they first came to Barton,



<P>at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward.



<P>She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London,



<P>nothing new of his plans, nothing certain even of his



<P>present abode.&nbsp; Some letters had passed between her



<P>and her brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness;



<P>and in the first of John's, there had been this sentence:--



<P>"We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no



<P>enquiries on so prohibited a subject, but conclude him



<P>to be still at Oxford;" which was all the intelligence



<P>of Edward afforded her by the correspondence, for his name



<P>was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.



<P>She was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of



<P>his measures.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their man-servant had been sent one morning

to Exeter



<P>on business; and when, as he waited at table, he had



<P>satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event



<P>of his errand, this was his voluntary communication--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr. Ferrars

is married."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes



<P>upon Elinor, saw her turning pale, and fell back in her



<P>chair in hysterics.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood, whose eyes, as she



<P>answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitively taken



<P>the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor's



<P>countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment



<P>afterwards, alike distressed by Marianne's situation,



<P>knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne

was



<P>taken ill, had sense enough to call one of the maids,



<P>who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance, supported her into



<P>the other room.&nbsp; By that time, Marianne was rather better,



<P>and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret



<P>and the maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still



<P>much disordered, had so far recovered the use of her reason



<P>and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas,



<P>as to the source of his intelligence.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood



<P>immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor



<P>had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married,

Thomas?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma'am, this morning



<P>in Exeter, and his lady too, Miss Steele as was.&nbsp; They was



<P>stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn,



<P>as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park



<P>to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened



<P>to look up as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly



<P>it was the youngest Miss Steele; so I took off my hat,



<P>and she knew me and called to me, and inquired after you,



<P>ma'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss Marianne,



<P>and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars's,



<P>their best compliments and service, and how sorry they



<P>was they had not time to come on and see you, but they was



<P>in a great hurry to go forwards, for they was going further



<P>down for a little while, but howsever, when they come back,



<P>they'd make sure to come and see you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, ma'am. She smiled, and said how she



<P>had changed her name since she was in these parts.



<P>She was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady,



<P>and very civil behaved.&nbsp; So, I made free to wish her joy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, ma'am, I just see him leaning back in

it,



<P>but he did not look up;--he never was a gentleman much



<P>for talking."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's heart could easily account for his

not



<P>putting himself forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably



<P>found the same explanation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Was there no one else in the carriage?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, ma'am, only they two."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know where they came from?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--



<P>Mrs. Ferrars told me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And are they going farther westward?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, ma'am--but not to bide long.&nbsp; They

will soon



<P>be back again, and then they'd be sure and call here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter;



<P>but Elinor knew better than to expect them.



<P>She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and was



<P>very confident that Edward would never come near them.



<P>She observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they



<P>were probably going down to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thomas's intelligence seemed over.&nbsp; Elinor

looked



<P>as if she wished to hear more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you see them off, before you came away?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, ma'am--the horses were just coming out,

but I



<P>could not bide any longer; I was afraid of being late."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, ma'am, she said how she was very well;



<P>and to my mind she was always a very handsome young



<P>lady--and she seemed vastly contented."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question,



<P>and Thomas and the tablecloth, now alike needless,



<P>were soon afterwards dismissed.&nbsp; Marianne had already sent



<P>to say, that she should eat nothing more.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood's



<P>and Elinor's appetites were equally lost, and Margaret



<P>might think herself very well off, that with so much



<P>uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced,



<P>so much reason as they had often had to be careless



<P>of their meals, she had never been obliged to go without



<P>her dinner before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the dessert and the wine were arranged,



<P>and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves,



<P>they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness



<P>and silence.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark,



<P>and ventured not to offer consolation.&nbsp; She now found



<P>that she had erred in relying on Elinor's representation



<P>of herself; and justly concluded that every thing



<P>had been expressly softened at the time, to spare her



<P>from an increase of unhappiness, suffering as she then



<P>had suffered for Marianne.&nbsp; She found that she had been



<P>misled by the careful, the considerate attention of



<P>her daughter, to think the attachment, which once she



<P>had so well understood, much slighter in reality, than



<P>she had been wont to believe, or than it was now proved



<P>to be.&nbsp; She feared that under this persuasion she had



<P>been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her Elinor;--



<P>that Marianne's affliction, because more acknowledged,



<P>more immediately before her, had too much engrossed



<P>her tenderness, and led her away to forget that in Elinor



<P>she might have a daughter suffering almost as much,



<P>certainly with less self-provocation, and greater fortitude.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER 43</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne got up the next morning at her usual

time;



<P>to every inquiry replied that she was better, and tried to



<P>prove herself so, by engaging in her accustomary employments.



<P>But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire



<P>with a book in her hand, which she was unable to read,



<P>or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak



<P>much in favour of her amendment; and when, at last,



<P>she went early to bed, more and more indisposed, Colonel



<P>Brandon was only astonished at her sister's composure,



<P>who, though attending and nursing her the whole day,



<P>against Marianne inclination, and forcing proper medicines



<P>on her at night, trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty



<P>and efficacy of sleep, and felt no real alarm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very restless and feverish night, however,



<P>disappointed the expectation of both; and when Marianne,



<P>after persisting in rising, confessed herself unable



<P>to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her bed,



<P>Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings's advice,



<P>of sending for the Palmers' apothecary.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging



<P>Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore



<P>her sister to health, yet, by pronouncing her disorder



<P>to have a putrid tendency, and allowing the word "infection"



<P>to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,



<P>on her baby's account.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined



<P>from the first to think Marianne's complaint more serious



<P>than Elinor, now looked very grave on Mr. Harris's report,



<P>and confirming Charlotte's fears and caution, urged the



<P>necessity of her immediate removal with her infant;



<P>and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as idle,



<P>found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great



<P>to be withstood.&nbsp; Her departure, therefore, was fixed on;



<P>and within an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off,



<P>with her little boy and his nurse, for the house of a



<P>near relation of Mr. Palmer's, who lived a few miles



<P>on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised,



<P>at her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two;



<P>and whither she was almost equally urgent with her



<P>mother to accompany her.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, however, with a



<P>kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her,



<P>declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland



<P>as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring,



<P>by her own attentive care, to supply to her the place



<P>of the mother she had taken her from; and Elinor found her



<P>on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,



<P>desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her



<P>better experience in nursing, of material use.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature



<P>of her malady, and feeling herself universally ill,



<P>could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered;



<P>and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced,



<P>but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe;



<P>for on that day they were to have begun their journey home;



<P>and, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings,



<P>were to have taken their mother by surprise on the



<P>following forenoon.&nbsp; The little she said was all in



<P>lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried



<P>to raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN



<P>really believed herself, that it would be a very short one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day produced little or no alteration

in the



<P>state of the patient; she certainly was not better, and,



<P>except that there was no amendment, did not appear worse.



<P>Their party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer,



<P>though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity



<P>and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be



<P>frightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last



<P>by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her;



<P>and while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself,



<P>with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going



<P>likewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings



<P>interposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away



<P>while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister's



<P>account, would be to deprive them both, she thought,



<P>of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once



<P>that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself,



<P>that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening,



<P>while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister, &amp;c. she



<P>urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying



<P>the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not



<P>long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's



<P>entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed



<P>to feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person



<P>so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance

of all



<P>these arrangements.&nbsp; She knew not that she had been



<P>the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away,



<P>in about seven days from the time of their arrival.



<P>It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer;



<P>and as it gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned



<P>her name.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's

departure,



<P>and her situation continued, with little variation,



<P>the same.&nbsp; Mr. Harris, who attended her every day,



<P>still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood



<P>was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others



<P>was by no means so cheerful.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings had determined



<P>very early in the seizure that Marianne would never



<P>get over it, and Colonel Brandon, who was chiefly



<P>of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's forebodings,



<P>was not in a state of mind to resist their influence.



<P>He tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different



<P>judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd;



<P>but the many hours of each day in which he was left



<P>entirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission



<P>of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from



<P>his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of the third day however, the

gloomy



<P>anticipations of both were almost done away; for when



<P>Mr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better.



<P>Her pulse was much stronger, and every symptom more favourable



<P>than on the preceding visit.&nbsp; Elinor, confirmed in every



<P>pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that



<P>in her letters to her mother, she had pursued her own



<P>judgment rather than her friend's, in making very light



<P>of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland;



<P>and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able



<P>to travel.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the day did not close so auspiciously as

it began.--



<P>Towards the evening Marianne became ill again, growing



<P>more heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before.



<P>Her sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to



<P>attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue



<P>of having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully



<P>administering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with



<P>satisfaction, sink at last into a slumber, from which



<P>she expected the most beneficial effects.&nbsp; Her sleep,



<P>though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it,



<P>lasted a considerable time; and anxious to observe



<P>the result of it herself, she resolved to sit with her



<P>during the whole of it.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, knowing nothing



<P>of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed;



<P>her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating



<P>herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained



<P>alone with Marianne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The repose of the latter became more and more

disturbed;



<P>and her sister, who watched, with unremitting attention



<P>her continual change of posture, and heard the frequent



<P>but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips,



<P>was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber,



<P>when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise



<P>in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness,



<P>cried out,--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is mama coming?--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not yet," cried the other, concealing her

terror,



<P>and assisting Marianne to lie down again, "but she will



<P>be here, I hope, before it is long.&nbsp; It is a great way,



<P>you know, from hence to Barton."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she must not go round by London," cried

Marianne,



<P>in the same hurried manner.&nbsp; "I shall never see her,



<P>if she goes by London."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not



<P>quite herself, and, while attempting to soothe her,



<P>eagerly felt her pulse.&nbsp; It was lower and quicker than ever!



<P>and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her alarm



<P>increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending



<P>instantly for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger



<P>to Barton for her mother.&nbsp; To consult with Colonel Brandon



<P>on the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought



<P>which immediately followed the resolution of its performance;



<P>and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place



<P>by her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room,



<P>where she knew he was generally to be found at a much



<P>later hour than the present.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was no time for hesitation.&nbsp; Her fears

and her



<P>difficulties were immediately before him.&nbsp; Her fears,



<P>he had no courage, no confidence to attempt the removal of:--



<P>he listened to them in silent despondence;--but her



<P>difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness



<P>that seemed to speak the occasion, and the service



<P>pre-arranged in his mind, he offered himself as the



<P>messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.&nbsp; Elinor made no



<P>resistance that was not easily overcome.&nbsp; She thanked him



<P>with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went



<P>to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and



<P>an order for post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines



<P>to her mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The comfort of such a friend at that moment

as Colonel



<P>Brandon--or such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully



<P>was it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guide,



<P>whose attendance must relieve, and whose friendship might



<P>soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summons COULD



<P>be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,



<P>would lessen it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted

with all



<P>the firmness of a collected mind, made every necessary



<P>arrangement with the utmost despatch, and calculated



<P>with exactness the time in which she might look for



<P>his return.&nbsp; Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.



<P>The horses arrived, even before they were expected,



<P>and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look



<P>of solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear,



<P>hurried into the carriage.&nbsp; It was then about twelve



<P>o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment to wait



<P>for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her



<P>the rest of the night.&nbsp; It was a night of almost equal



<P>suffering to both.&nbsp; Hour after hour passed away in sleepless



<P>pain and delirium on Marianne's side, and in the most



<P>cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared.



<P>Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all



<P>her former security; and the servant who sat up with her,



<P>for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called,



<P>only tortured her more, by hints of what her mistress



<P>had always thought.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals,



<P>fixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she



<P>mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the heart of



<P>poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled



<P>with so many days of illness, and wretched for some



<P>immediate relief, fancied that all relief might soon



<P>be in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long,



<P>and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving



<P>too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was on the point of sending again for Mr.

Harris,



<P>or if HE could not come, for some other advice,



<P>when the former--but not till after five o'clock--arrived.



<P>His opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay,



<P>for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant



<P>alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger



<P>to be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh



<P>mode of treatment must procure, with a confidence which,



<P>in a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor.&nbsp; He promised



<P>to call again in the course of three or four hours,



<P>and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more



<P>composed than he had found them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With strong concern, and with many reproaches

for not



<P>being called to their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the



<P>morning of what had passed.&nbsp; Her former apprehensions,



<P>now with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of



<P>the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,



<P>her conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her



<P>to offer the comfort of hope.&nbsp; Her heart was really grieved.



<P>The rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young,



<P>so lovely as Marianne, must have struck a less interested



<P>person with concern.&nbsp; On Mrs. Jennings's compassion



<P>she had other claims.&nbsp; She had been for three months



<P>her companion, was still under her care, and she was



<P>known to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy.



<P>The distress of her sister too, particularly a favourite,



<P>was before her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings



<P>considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what



<P>Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings



<P>was very sincere.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;--



<P>but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the



<P>last would produce.&nbsp; His medicines had failed;--the fever



<P>was unabated; and Marianne only more quiet--not more



<P>herself--remained in a heavy stupor.&nbsp; Elinor, catching all,



<P>and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call



<P>in further advice.&nbsp; But he judged it unnecessary: he had



<P>still something more to try, some more fresh application,



<P>of whose success he was as confident as the last, and his



<P>visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached



<P>the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood.



<P>She was calm, except when she thought of her mother;



<P>but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued



<P>till noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed,



<P>her thoughts wandering from one image of grief,



<P>one suffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed



<P>to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,



<P>who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger



<P>of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition



<P>which Marianne's disappointment had brought on.



<P>Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it



<P>gave fresh misery to her reflections.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About noon, however, she began--but with a

caution--a



<P>dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent,



<P>even to her friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive



<P>a slight amendment in her sister's pulse;--she waited,



<P>watched, and examined it again and again;--and at last,



<P>with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness,



<P>than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate



<P>her hopes.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,



<P>to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her



<P>young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;--



<P>and Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust,



<P>told herself likewise not to hope.&nbsp; But it was too late.



<P>Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter,



<P>she bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what.



<P>Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom



<P>yet blessed her.&nbsp; Others even arose to confirm it.



<P>Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered Elinor



<P>with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on



<P>her with a rational, though languid, gaze.&nbsp; Anxiety and



<P>hope now oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no



<P>moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at



<P>four o'clock;--when his assurances, his felicitations on



<P>a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation,



<P>gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was in every respect materially better,



<P>and he declared her entirely out of danger.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings,



<P>perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her



<P>forebodings which had been found in their late alarm,



<P>allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,



<P>with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness,



<P>the probability of an entire recovery.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not be cheerful.&nbsp; Her joy

was of a



<P>different kind, and led to any thing rather than to gaiety.



<P>Marianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her



<P>doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations



<P>of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;--



<P>but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,



<P>no smiles.&nbsp; All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction,



<P>silent and strong.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She continued by the side of her sister, with

little



<P>intermission the whole afternoon, calming every fear,



<P>satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits,



<P>supplying every succour, and watching almost every look and



<P>every breath.&nbsp; The possibility of a relapse would of course,



<P>in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was--



<P>but when she saw, on her frequent and minute examination,



<P>that every symptom of recovery continued, and saw Marianne



<P>at six o'clock sink into a quiet, steady, and to all



<P>appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon



<P>might be expected back.&nbsp; At ten o'clock, she trusted,



<P>or at least not much later her mother would be relieved



<P>from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be



<P>travelling towards them.&nbsp; The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely



<P>less an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress



<P>of time which yet kept them in ignorance!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly

asleep,



<P>she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea.



<P>Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of



<P>dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating much;--



<P>and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings



<P>of content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome.



<P>Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its conclusion,



<P>to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to



<P>take her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue,



<P>no capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was



<P>not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant.



<P>Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the



<P>sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,



<P>left her there again to her charge and her thoughts,



<P>and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night was cold and stormy.&nbsp; The wind

roared



<P>round the house, and the rain beat against the windows;



<P>but Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not.



<P>Marianne slept through every blast; and the travellers--



<P>they had a rich reward in store, for every present inconvenience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clock struck eight.&nbsp; Had it been ten,



<P>Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment



<P>she heard a carriage driving up to the house;



<P>and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite



<P>of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come,



<P>that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and



<P>opened a window shutter, to be satisfied of the truth.



<P>She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her.



<P>The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view.



<P>By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it



<P>to be drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the



<P>excess of her poor mother's alarm, gave some explanation



<P>to such unexpected rapidity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult



<P>to be calm, as at that moment.&nbsp; The knowledge of what her



<P>mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door--



<P>of her doubt--her dread--perhaps her despair!--and



<P>of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was



<P>impossible to be calm.&nbsp; All that remained to be done



<P>was to be speedy; and, therefore staying only till



<P>she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid with her sister,



<P>she hurried down stairs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed

along



<P>an inner lobby, assured her that they were already



<P>in the house.&nbsp; She rushed to the drawing-room,--she



<P>entered it,--and saw only Willoughby.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other short call in Harley Street, in which

Elinor



<P>received her brother's congratulations on their travelling



<P>so far towards Barton without any expense, and on Colonel



<P>Brandon's being to follow them to Cleveland in a day or two,



<P>completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters



<P>in town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come



<P>to Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way,



<P>which of all things was the most unlikely to occur,



<P>with a more warm, though less public, assurance, from John



<P>to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he should come



<P>to see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any meeting



<P>in the country.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It amused her to observe that all her friends

seemed



<P>determined to send her to Delaford;--a place, in which,



<P>of all others, she would now least chuse to visit, or wish



<P>to reside; for not only was it considered as her future



<P>home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy,



<P>when they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit



<P>her there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very early in April, and tolerably early in

the day,



<P>the two parties from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set



<P>out from their respective homes, to meet, by appointment,



<P>on the road.&nbsp; For the convenience of Charlotte and her child,



<P>they were to be more than two days on their journey,



<P>and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with



<P>Colonel Brandon, was to join them at Cleveland soon after



<P>their arrival.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne, few as had been her hours of comfort



<P>in London, and eager as she had long been to quit it,



<P>could not, when it came to the point, bid adieu to



<P>the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed



<P>those hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby,



<P>which were now extinguished for ever, without great pain.



<P>Nor could she leave the place in which Willoughby remained,



<P>busy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which SHE



<P>could have no share, without shedding many tears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's satisfaction, at the moment of removal,



<P>was more positive.&nbsp; She had no such object for her lingering



<P>thoughts to fix on, she left no creature behind, from whom



<P>it would give her a moment's regret to be divided for ever,



<P>she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution



<P>of Lucy's friendship, she was grateful for bringing



<P>her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage,



<P>and she looked forward with hope to what a few months



<P>of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring



<P>Marianne's peace of mind, and confirming her own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their journey was safely performed.&nbsp; The

second



<P>day brought them into the cherished, or the prohibited,



<P>county of Somerset, for as such was it dwelt on by turns



<P>in Marianne's imagination; and in the forenoon of the third



<P>they drove up to Cleveland.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built house,



<P>situated on a sloping lawn.&nbsp; It had no park, but the



<P>pleasure-grounds were tolerably extensive; and like



<P>every other place of the same degree of importance,



<P>it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk,



<P>a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation,



<P>led to the front, the lawn was dotted over with timber,



<P>the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir,



<P>the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of



<P>them altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars,



<P>shut out the offices.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling



<P>with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty



<P>miles from Barton, and not thirty from Combe Magna;



<P>and before she had been five minutes within its walls,



<P>while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show



<P>her child to the housekeeper, she quitted it again,



<P>stealing away through the winding shrubberies, now just



<P>beginning to be in beauty, to gain a distant eminence;



<P>where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering over



<P>a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly



<P>rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon,



<P>and fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might



<P>be seen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such moments of precious, invaluable misery,



<P>she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland;



<P>and as she returned by a different circuit to the house,



<P>feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty,



<P>of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude,



<P>she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day



<P>while she remained with the Palmers, in the indulgence of



<P>such solitary rambles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She returned just in time to join the others



<P>as they quitted the house, on an excursion through its



<P>more immediate premises; and the rest of the morning was



<P>easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen garden,



<P>examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the



<P>gardener's lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through



<P>the green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants,



<P>unwarily exposed, and nipped by the lingering frost,



<P>raised the laughter of Charlotte,--and in visiting her



<P>poultry-yard, where, in the disappointed hopes of her



<P>dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, or being



<P>stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising



<P>young brood, she found fresh sources of merriment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning was fine and dry, and Marianne,



<P>in her plan of employment abroad, had not calculated



<P>for any change of weather during their stay at Cleveland.



<P>With great surprise therefore, did she find herself prevented



<P>by a settled rain from going out again after dinner.



<P>She had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple,



<P>and perhaps all over the grounds, and an evening merely



<P>cold or damp would not have deterred her from it;



<P>but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry



<P>or pleasant weather for walking.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their party was small, and the hours passed

quietly away.



<P>Mrs. Palmer had her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work;



<P>they talked of the friends they had left behind,



<P>arranged Lady Middleton's engagements, and wondered



<P>whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther



<P>than Reading that night.&nbsp; Elinor, however little concerned



<P>in it, joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had



<P>the knack of finding her way in every house to the library,



<P>however it might be avoided by the family in general,



<P>soon procured herself a book.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer's side that

constant



<P>and friendly good humour could do, to make them feel



<P>themselves welcome.&nbsp; The openness and heartiness of her



<P>manner more than atoned for that want of recollection



<P>and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms



<P>of politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty



<P>a face, was engaging; her folly, though evident



<P>was not disgusting, because it was not conceited;



<P>and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a

very



<P>late dinner, affording a pleasant enlargement of the party,



<P>and a very welcome variety to their conversation, which a



<P>long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and

in that



<P>little had seen so much variety in his address to her



<P>sister and herself, that she knew not what to expect



<P>to find him in his own family.&nbsp; She found him, however,



<P>perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,



<P>and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother;



<P>she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion,



<P>and only prevented from being so always, by too great



<P>an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people



<P>in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs. Jennings



<P>and Charlotte.&nbsp; For the rest of his character and habits,



<P>they were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive,



<P>with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life.



<P>He was nice in his eating, uncertain in his hours;



<P>fond of his child, though affecting to slight it;



<P>and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought



<P>to have been devoted to business.&nbsp; She liked him, however,



<P>upon the whole, much better than she had expected, and in



<P>her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;--



<P>not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism,



<P>his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with complacency



<P>on the remembrance of Edward's generous temper, simple taste,



<P>and diffident feelings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Edward, or at least of some of his concerns,



<P>she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon,



<P>who had been into Dorsetshire lately; and who,



<P>treating her at once as the disinterested friend



<P>of Mr. Ferrars, and the kind of confidant of himself,



<P>talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford,



<P>described its deficiencies, and told her what he meant



<P>to do himself towards removing them.--His behaviour



<P>to her in this, as well as in every other particular,



<P>his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence



<P>of only ten days, his readiness to converse with her,



<P>and his deference for her opinion, might very well



<P>justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his attachment,



<P>and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still,



<P>as from the first, believed Marianne his real favourite,



<P>to make her suspect it herself.&nbsp; But as it was,



<P>such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head,



<P>except by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; and she could



<P>not help believing herself the nicest observer of the



<P>two;--she watched his eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought



<P>only of his behaviour;--and while his looks of anxious



<P>solicitude on Marianne's feeling, in her head and throat,



<P>the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,



<P>entirely escaped the latter lady's observation;--SHE could



<P>discover in them the quick feelings, and needless alarm



<P>of a lover.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two delighful twilight walks on the third and

fourth



<P>evenings of her being there, not merely on the dry gravel



<P>of the shrubbery, but all over the grounds, and especially



<P>in the most distant parts of them, where there was something



<P>more of wildness than in the rest, where the trees were



<P>the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,



<P>had--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting



<P>in her wet shoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold



<P>so violent as, though for a day or two trifled with



<P>or denied, would force itself by increasing ailments on



<P>the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.



<P>Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual,



<P>were all declined.&nbsp; Though heavy and feverish, with a pain



<P>in her limbs, and a cough, and a sore throat, a good night's



<P>rest was to cure her entirely; and it was with difficulty



<P>that Elinor prevailed on her, when she went to bed,



<P>to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Miss Dashwood," said Mrs. Jennings,



<P>sagaciously smiling, as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn,



<P>"I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you;



<P>for though, upon my honour, I TRIED to keep out of hearing,



<P>I could not help catching enough to understand his business.



<P>And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life,



<P>and I wish you joy of it with all my heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, ma'am," said Elinor.&nbsp; "It

is a matter



<P>of great joy to me; and I feel the goodness of Colonel



<P>Brandon most sensibly.&nbsp; There are not many men who would



<P>act as he has done.&nbsp; Few people who have so compassionate



<P>a heart!&nbsp; I never was more astonished in my life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord! my dear, you are very modest.&nbsp;

I an't the least



<P>astonished at it in the world, for I have often thought



<P>of late, there was nothing more likely to happen."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel's



<P>general benevolence; but at least you could not foresee



<P>that the opportunity would so very soon occur."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Opportunity!" repeated Mrs. Jennings--"Oh!

as to that,



<P>when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing,



<P>somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity.



<P>Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and again;



<P>and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think



<P>I shall soon know where to look for them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,"



<P>said Elinor, with a faint smile.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed.&nbsp; And

as to the house



<P>being a bad one, I do not know what the Colonel would be at,



<P>for it is as good a one as ever I saw."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He spoke of its being out of repair."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, and whose fault is that? why don't he

repair it?--



<P>who should do it but himself?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were interrupted by the servant's coming

in to



<P>announce the carriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings



<P>immediately preparing to go, said,--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have

had half



<P>my talk out.&nbsp; But, however, we may have it all over in



<P>the evening; for we shall be quite alone.&nbsp; I do not ask



<P>you to go with me, for I dare say your mind is too full



<P>of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must



<P>long to tell your sister all about it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne had left the room before the conversation

began.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly, ma'am, I shall tell Marianne of

it;



<P>but I shall not mention it at present to any body else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! very well," said Mrs. Jennings rather

disappointed.



<P>"Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think



<P>of going as far as Holborn to-day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, ma'am, not even Lucy if you please.



<P>One day's delay will not be very material; and till I



<P>have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought not to be



<P>mentioned to any body else.&nbsp; I shall do THAT directly.



<P>It is of importance that no time should be lost with him,



<P>for he will of course have much to do relative to



<P>his ordination."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings

exceedingly.



<P>Why Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it



<P>in such a hurry, she could not immediately comprehend.



<P>A few moments' reflection, however, produced a very happy idea,



<P>and she exclaimed;--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, ho!--I understand you.&nbsp; Mr. Ferrars

is to be



<P>the man.&nbsp; Well, so much the better for him.&nbsp; Ay, to be sure,



<P>he must be ordained in readiness; and I am very glad



<P>to find things are so forward between you.&nbsp; But, my dear,



<P>is not this rather out of character?&nbsp; Should not the Colonel



<P>write himself?--sure, he is the proper person."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor did not quite understand the beginning

of



<P>Mrs. Jennings's speech, neither did she think it worth



<P>inquiring into; and therefore only replied to its conclusion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that

he rather



<P>wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars



<P>than himself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And so YOU are forced to do it.&nbsp; Well

THAT is an odd



<P>kind of delicacy!&nbsp; However, I will not disturb you (seeing



<P>her preparing to write.)&nbsp; You know your own concerns best.



<P>So goodby, my dear.&nbsp; I have not heard of any thing to



<P>please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And away she went; but returning again in a

moment,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have just been thinking of Betty's sister,

my dear.



<P>I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress.



<P>But whether she would do for a lady's maid, I am sure I



<P>can't tell.&nbsp; She is an excellent housemaid, and works



<P>very well at her needle.&nbsp; However, you will think of all



<P>that at your leisure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly, ma'am," replied Elinor, not hearing



<P>much of what she said, and more anxious to be alone,



<P>than to be mistress of the subject.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How she should begin--how she should express



<P>herself in her note to Edward, was now all her concern.



<P>The particular circumstances between them made



<P>a difficulty of that which to any other person would



<P>have been the easiest thing in the world; but she



<P>equally feared to say too much or too little, and sat



<P>deliberating over her paper, with the pen in her band,



<P>till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her

way to



<P>the carriage, as he came to leave his farewell card; and she,



<P>after apologising for not returning herself, had obliged



<P>him to enter, by saying that Miss Dashwood was above,



<P>and wanted to speak with him on very particular business.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had just been congratulating herself,



<P>in the midst of her perplexity, that however difficult it



<P>might be to express herself properly by letter, it was



<P>at least preferable to giving the information by word



<P>of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her upon this



<P>greatest exertion of all.&nbsp; Her astonishment and confusion



<P>were very great on his so sudden appearance.&nbsp; She had



<P>not seen him before since his engagement became public,



<P>and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted



<P>with it; which, with the consciousness of what she



<P>had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him,



<P>made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.



<P>He too was much distressed; and they sat down together



<P>in a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether he



<P>had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming



<P>into the room, he could not recollect; but determining



<P>to be on the safe side, he made his apology in form



<P>as soon as he could say any thing, after taking a chair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Jennings told me," said he, "that you

wished



<P>to speak with me, at least I understood her so--or I



<P>certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner;



<P>though at the same time, I should have been extremely



<P>sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;



<P>especially as it will most likely be some time--it



<P>is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure



<P>of meeting you again.&nbsp; I go to Oxford tomorrow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You would not have gone, however," said Elinor,



<P>recovering herself, and determined to get over what she



<P>so much dreaded as soon as possible, "without receiving



<P>our good wishes, even if we had not been able to give them



<P>in person.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said.



<P>I have something of consequence to inform you of,



<P>which I was on the point of communicating by paper.



<P>I am charged with a most agreeable office (breathing



<P>rather faster than usual as she spoke.)&nbsp; Colonel Brandon,



<P>who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to say,



<P>that understanding you mean to take orders, he has



<P>great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford



<P>now just vacant, and only wishes it were more valuable.



<P>Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable



<P>and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that



<P>the living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much



<P>more considerable, and such as might better enable you



<P>to--as might be more than a temporary accommodation to



<P>yourself--such, in short, as might establish all your views



<P>of happiness."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself,



<P>it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him.



<P>He LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected,



<P>such unthought-of information could not fail of exciting;



<P>but he said only these two words,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Colonel Brandon!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," continued Elinor, gathering more resolution,



<P>as some of the worst was over, "Colonel Brandon means



<P>it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately



<P>passed--for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable



<P>conduct of your family has placed you--a concern



<P>which I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends,



<P>must share; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem



<P>for your general character, and his particular approbation



<P>of your behaviour on the present occasion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Colonel Brandon give ME a living!--Can it

be possible?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The unkindness of your own relations has made

you



<P>astonished to find friendship any where."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," replied be, with sudden consciousness,

"not to



<P>find it in YOU; for I cannot be ignorant that to you,



<P>to your goodness, I owe it all.--I feel it--I would express



<P>it if I could--but, as you well know, I am no orator."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very much mistaken.&nbsp; I do assure

you



<P>that you owe it entirely, at least almost entirely,



<P>to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon's discernment



<P>of it.&nbsp; I have had no hand in it.&nbsp; I did not even know,



<P>till I understood his design, that the living was vacant;



<P>nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have



<P>had such a living in his gift.&nbsp; As a friend of mine,



<P>of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he HAS,



<P>still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word,



<P>you owe nothing to my solicitation."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small

share



<P>in the action, but she was at the same time so unwilling



<P>to appear as the benefactress of Edward, that she acknowledged



<P>it with hesitation; which probably contributed to fix



<P>that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it.



<P>For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had ceased



<P>to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth



<P>and respectability.&nbsp; I have always heard him spoken



<P>of as such, and your brother I know esteems him highly.



<P>He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners



<P>perfectly the gentleman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed," replied Elinor, "I believe that you

will find him,



<P>on farther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be,



<P>and as you will be such very near neighbours (for I understand



<P>the parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house,)



<P>it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward made no answer; but when she had turned



<P>away her head, gave her a look so serious, so earnest,



<P>so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he might hereafter wish



<P>the distance between the parsonage and the mansion-house



<P>much greater.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James

Street,"



<P>said he, soon afterwards, rising from his chair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor told him the number of the house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I must hurry away then, to give him those

thanks



<P>which you will not allow me to give YOU; to assure him



<P>that he has made me a very--an exceedingly happy man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor did not offer to detain him; and they

parted,



<P>with a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing



<P>good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation



<P>that might befall him; on HIS, with rather an attempt to



<P>return the same good will, than the power of expressing it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I see him again," said Elinor to herself,



<P>as the door shut him out, "I shall see him the husband



<P>of Lucy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with this pleasing anticipation, she sat

down



<P>to reconsider the past, recall the words and endeavour



<P>to comprehend all the feelings of Edward; and, of course,



<P>to reflect on her own with discontent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned



<P>from seeing people whom she had never seen before,



<P>and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say,



<P>her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret



<P>in her possession, than by anything else, that she



<P>reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, my dear," she cried, "I sent you up

to the



<P>young man.&nbsp; Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had



<P>no great difficulty--You did not find him very unwilling



<P>to accept your proposal?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, ma'am; THAT was not very likely."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, and how soon will he be ready?--For

it seems



<P>all to depend upon that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really," said Elinor, "I know so little of

these kind



<P>of forms, that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time,



<P>or the preparation necessary; but I suppose two or three



<P>months will complete his ordination."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two or three months!" cried Mrs. Jennings;

"Lord! my dear,



<P>how calmly you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two



<P>or three months! Lord bless me!--I am sure it would put ME



<P>quite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad



<P>to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think it is



<P>not worth while to wait two or three months for him.



<P>Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well;



<P>somebody that is in orders already."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear ma'am," said Elinor, "what can you

be thinking of?--



<P>Why, Colonel Brandon's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord bless you, my dear!--Sure you do not

mean to persuade



<P>me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving



<P>ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deception could not continue after this;



<P>and an explanation immediately took place, by which both



<P>gained considerable amusement for the moment, without any



<P>material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs. Jennings



<P>only exchanged one form of delight for another, and still



<P>without forfeiting her expectation of the first.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,"

said she,



<P>after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction



<P>was over, "and very likely MAY be out of repair; but to hear



<P>a man apologising, as I thought, for a house that to my



<P>knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor, and I



<P>think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!--



<P>and to you too, that had been used to live in Barton



<P>cottage!--It seems quite ridiculous.&nbsp; But, my dear, we must



<P>touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage,



<P>and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy goes to it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have

any idea



<P>of the living's being enough to allow them to marry."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he

has two



<P>thousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry



<P>on less.&nbsp; Take my word for it, that, if I am alive, I shall



<P>be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas;



<P>and I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't there."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the

probability



<P>of their not waiting for any thing more.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel

Brandon,



<P>proceeded with his happiness to Lucy; and such was the



<P>excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett's Buildings,



<P>that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings, who called



<P>on her again the next day with her congratulations,



<P>that she had never seen him in such spirits before in



<P>her life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were

at



<P>least very certain; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most



<P>heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably



<P>together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.



<P>So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness



<P>to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her,



<P>that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most



<P>grateful warmth, was ready to own all their obligation



<P>to her, and openly declared that no exertion for their



<P>good on Miss Dashwood's part, either present or future,



<P>would ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of



<P>doing any thing in the world for those she really valued.



<P>As for Colonel Brandon, she was not only ready to worship



<P>him as a saint, but was moreover truly anxious that



<P>he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;



<P>anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost;



<P>and scarcely resolved to avail herself, at Delaford,



<P>as far as she possibly could, of his servants, his carriage,



<P>his cows, and his poultry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was now above a week since John Dashwood

had



<P>called in Berkeley Street, and as since that time no notice



<P>had been taken by them of his wife's indisposition,



<P>beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel it



<P>necessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation,



<P>however, which not only opposed her own inclination,



<P>but which had not the assistance of any encouragement



<P>from her companions.&nbsp; Marianne, not contented with



<P>absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent



<P>to prevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings,



<P>though her carriage was always at Elinor's service,



<P>so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood, that not even her



<P>curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery,



<P>nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward's part,



<P>could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again.



<P>The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself



<P>to pay a visit, for which no one could really have



<P>less inclination, and to run the risk of a tete-a-tete



<P>with a woman, whom neither of the others had so much



<P>reason to dislike.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage

could



<P>turn from the house, her husband accidentally came out.



<P>He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor, told her



<P>that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street, and,



<P>assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her,



<P>invited her to come in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--Nobody



<P>was there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fanny is in her own room, I suppose," said

he:--"I



<P>will go to her presently, for I am sure she will not



<P>have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.--



<P>Very far from it, indeed.&nbsp; NOW especially there



<P>cannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always



<P>great favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor made what excuse she could for her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not sorry to see you alone," he replied,



<P>"for I have a good deal to say to you.&nbsp; This living



<P>of Colonel Brandon's--can it be true?--has he really given



<P>it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was



<P>coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has

given



<P>the living of Delaford to Edward."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no



<P>relationship!--no connection between them!--and now



<P>that livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "About two hundred a year."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very well--and for the next presentation to

a living



<P>of that value--supposing the late incumbent to have



<P>been old and sickly, and likely to vacate it soon--he



<P>might have got I dare say--fourteen hundred pounds.



<P>And how came he not to have settled that matter before this



<P>person's death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it,



<P>but a man of Colonel Brandon's sense!--I wonder he should



<P>be so improvident in a point of such common, such natural,



<P>concern!--Well, I am convinced that there is a vast deal



<P>of inconsistency in almost every human character.&nbsp; I suppose,



<P>however--on recollection--that the case may probably be THIS.



<P>Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom



<P>the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough



<P>to take it.--Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively;



<P>and by relating that she had herself been employed



<P>in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward,



<P>and, therefore, must understand the terms on which it



<P>was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is truly astonishing!"--he cried, after

hearing



<P>what she said--"what could be the Colonel's motive?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be,



<P>Edward is a very lucky man.--You will not mention the matter



<P>to Fanny, however, for though I have broke it to her,



<P>and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear



<P>it much talked of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain

from observing,



<P>that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure,



<P>an acquisition of wealth to her brother, by which neither



<P>she nor her child could be possibly impoverished.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Ferrars," added he, lowering his voice

to the



<P>tone becoming so important a subject, "knows nothing



<P>about it at present, and I believe it will be best to



<P>keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.--



<P>When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear



<P>of it all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why should such precaution be used?--Though



<P>it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have



<P>the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has



<P>money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be quite



<P>out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour,



<P>is she supposed to feel at all?--She has done with her



<P>son, she cast him off for ever, and has made all those



<P>over whom she had any influence, cast him off likewise.



<P>Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable



<P>to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--



<P>she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him.--



<P>She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort



<P>of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of a parent!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! Elinor," said John, "your reasoning is

very good,



<P>but it is founded on ignorance of human nature.



<P>When Edward's unhappy match takes place, depend upon it



<P>his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him;



<P>and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that



<P>dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible.



<P>Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You surprise me; I should think it must nearly



<P>have escaped her memory by THIS time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You wrong her exceedingly.&nbsp; Mrs. Ferrars

is one



<P>of the most affectionate mothers in the world."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor was silent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We think NOW,"--said Mr. Dashwood, after a

short pause,



<P>"of ROBERT'S marrying Miss Morton."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance



<P>of her brother's tone, calmly replied,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the

affair."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Choice!--how do you mean?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only mean that I suppose, from your manner



<P>of speaking, it must be the same to Miss Morton whether



<P>she marry Edward or Robert."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly, there can be no difference; for

Robert



<P>will now to all intents and purposes be considered



<P>as the eldest son;--and as to any thing else, they are



<P>both very agreeable young men: I do not know that one



<P>is superior to the other."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor said no more, and John was also for

a short



<P>time silent.--His reflections ended thus.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of ONE thing, my dear sister," kindly taking

her hand,



<P>and speaking in an awful whisper,--"I may assure you;--



<P>and I WILL do it, because I know it must gratify you.



<P>I have good reason to think--indeed I have it from the



<P>best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise



<P>it would be very wrong to say any thing about it--but



<P>I have it from the very best authority--not that I ever



<P>precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself--but her



<P>daughter DID, and I have it from her--That in short,



<P>whatever objections there might be against a certain--a



<P>certain connection--you understand me--it would have been



<P>far preferable to her, it would not have given her half



<P>the vexation that THIS does.&nbsp; I was exceedingly pleased



<P>to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light--



<P>a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all.



<P>'It would have been beyond comparison,' she said, 'the least



<P>evil of the two, and she would be glad to compound NOW



<P>for nothing worse.' But however, all that is quite out



<P>of the question--not to be thought of or mentioned--



<P>as to any attachment you know--it never could be--all



<P>that is gone by.&nbsp; But I thought I would just tell you



<P>of this, because I knew how much it must please you.



<P>Not that you have any reason to regret, my dear Elinor.&nbsp; There



<P>is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well--quite as well,



<P>or better, perhaps, all things considered.&nbsp; Has Colonel



<P>Brandon been with you lately?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify

her vanity,



<P>and raise her self-importance, to agitate her nerves



<P>and fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be



<P>spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself,



<P>and from the danger of hearing any thing more from



<P>her brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars.



<P>After a few moments' chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that



<P>Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister's being there,



<P>quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was left



<P>to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the



<P>gay unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner



<P>while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother's love



<P>and liberality, to the prejudice of his banished brother,



<P>earned only by his own dissipated course of life, and that



<P>brother's integrity, was confirming her most unfavourable



<P>opinion of his head and heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves,



<P>before he began to speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard



<P>of the living, and was very inquisitive on the subject.



<P>Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as she had given them



<P>to John; and their effect on Robert, though very different,



<P>was not less striking than it had been on HIM.&nbsp; He laughed



<P>most immoderately.&nbsp; The idea of Edward's being a clergyman,



<P>and living in a small parsonage-house, diverted him



<P>beyond measure;--and when to that was added the fanciful



<P>imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice,



<P>and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and



<P>Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable



<P>gravity, the conclusion of such folly, could not restrain



<P>her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke



<P>all the contempt it excited.&nbsp; It was a look, however,



<P>very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings, and gave



<P>no intelligence to him.&nbsp; He was recalled from wit to wisdom,



<P>not by any reproof of her's, but by his own sensibility.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We may treat it as a joke," said he, at last,



<P>recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably



<P>lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment--"but, upon



<P>my soul, it is a most serious business.&nbsp; Poor Edward!



<P>he is ruined for ever.&nbsp; I am extremely sorry for it--



<P>for I know him to be a very good-hearted creature; as



<P>well-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world.



<P>You must not judge of him, Miss Dashwood, from YOUR



<P>slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are certainly



<P>not the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born,



<P>you know, with the same powers,--the same address.--



<P>Poor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!--



<P>to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul,



<P>I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom;



<P>and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my



<P>life, as when it all burst forth.&nbsp; I could not believe it.--



<P>My mother was the first person who told me of it;



<P>and I, feeling myself called on to act with resolution,



<P>immediately said to her, 'My dear madam, I do not know



<P>what you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself,



<P>I must say, that if Edward does marry this young woman,



<P>I never will see him again.' That was what I said immediately.--



<P>I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has



<P>done for himself completely--shut himself out for ever from



<P>all decent society!--but, as I directly said to my mother,



<P>I am not in the least surprised at it; from his style



<P>of education, it was always to be expected.&nbsp; My poor mother



<P>was half frantic."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever seen the lady?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; once, while she was staying in this house,



<P>I happened to drop in for ten minutes; and I saw



<P>quite enough of her.&nbsp; The merest awkward country girl,



<P>without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty.--



<P>I remember her perfectly.&nbsp; Just the kind of girl I



<P>should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward.



<P>I offered immediately, as soon as my mother related



<P>the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade



<P>him from the match; but it was too late THEN, I found,



<P>to do any thing, for unluckily, I was not in the way



<P>at first, and knew nothing of it till after the breach



<P>had taken place, when it was not for me, you know,



<P>to interfere.&nbsp; But had I been informed of it a few



<P>hours earlier--I think it is most probable--that something



<P>might have been hit on.&nbsp; I certainly should have represented



<P>it to Edward in a very strong light.&nbsp; 'My dear fellow,'



<P>I should have said, 'consider what you are doing.



<P>You are making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one



<P>as your family are unanimous in disapproving.' I cannot



<P>help thinking, in short, that means might have been found.



<P>But now it is all too late.&nbsp; He must be starved, you know;--



<P>that is certain; absolutely starved."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had just settled this point with great composure,



<P>when the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject.



<P>But though SHE never spoke of it out of her own family,



<P>Elinor could see its influence on her mind, in the something



<P>like confusion of countenance with which she entered,



<P>and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself.



<P>She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find



<P>that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town,



<P>as she had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion



<P>in which her husband, who attended her into the room,



<P>and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish



<P>every thing that was most affectionate and graceful.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances

of his



<P>release might appear to the whole family, it was certain



<P>that Edward was free; and to what purpose that freedom would



<P>be employed was easily pre-determined by all;--for after



<P>experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent engagement,



<P>contracted without his mother's consent, as he had already



<P>done for more than four years, nothing less could be expected



<P>of him in the failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction



<P>of another.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple

one.



<P>It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;--and considering



<P>that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question,



<P>it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable



<P>in the present case as he really did, so much in need of



<P>encouragement and fresh air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How soon he had walked himself into the proper



<P>resolution, however, how soon an opportunity of exercising



<P>it occurred, in what manner he expressed himself,



<P>and how he was received, need not be particularly told.



<P>This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to



<P>table at four o'clock, about three hours after his arrival,



<P>he had secured his lady, engaged her mother's consent,



<P>and was not only in the rapturous profession of



<P>the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth,



<P>one of the happiest of men.&nbsp; His situation indeed was



<P>more than commonly joyful.&nbsp; He had more than the ordinary



<P>triumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise



<P>his spirits.&nbsp; He was released without any reproach



<P>to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed



<P>his misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;--



<P>and elevated at once to that security with another,



<P>which he must have thought of almost with despair,



<P>as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire.



<P>He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from



<P>misery to happiness;--and the change was openly spoken



<P>in such a genuine, flowing, grateful cheerfulness,



<P>as his friends had never witnessed in him before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses,



<P>all its errors confessed, and his first boyish attachment



<P>to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,"



<P>said he, "the consequence of ignorance of the world--



<P>and want of employment.&nbsp; Had my brother given me



<P>some active profession when I was removed at eighteen



<P>from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think--nay, I am sure,



<P>it would never have happened; for though I left Longstaple



<P>with what I thought, at the time, a most unconquerable



<P>preference for his niece, yet had I then had any pursuit,



<P>any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance



<P>from her for a few months, I should very soon have



<P>outgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing



<P>more with the world, as in such case I must have done.



<P>But instead of having any thing to do, instead of having any



<P>profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any myself,



<P>I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first



<P>twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment,



<P>which belonging to the university would have given me;



<P>for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen.



<P>I had therefore nothing in the world to do, but to fancy



<P>myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home



<P>in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend,



<P>no companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance,



<P>it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple,



<P>where I always felt myself at home, and was always sure



<P>of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part



<P>of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared



<P>everything that was amiable and obliging.&nbsp; She was pretty



<P>too--at least I thought so THEN; and I had seen so little



<P>of other women, that I could make no comparisons, and see



<P>no defects.&nbsp; Considering everything, therefore, I hope,



<P>foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since



<P>in every way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural



<P>or an inexcusable piece of folly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The change which a few hours had wrought in

the minds



<P>and the happiness of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as



<P>promised them all, the satisfaction of a sleepless night.



<P>Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be comfortable, knew not how



<P>to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how to be enough



<P>thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy,



<P>nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained



<P>conversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished,



<P>the sight and society of both.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne could speak HER happiness only by

tears.



<P>Comparisons would occur--regrets would arise;--and her joy,



<P>though sincere as her love for her sister, was of a kind to



<P>give her neither spirits nor language.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From



<P>the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another,



<P>that Edward was free, to the moment of his justifying



<P>the hopes which had so instantly followed, she was every



<P>thing by turns but tranquil.&nbsp; But when the second moment



<P>had passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude



<P>removed, compared her situation with what so lately it



<P>had been,--saw him honourably released from his former



<P>engagement, saw him instantly profiting by the release,



<P>to address herself and declare an affection as tender,



<P>as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she



<P>was oppressed, she was overcome by her own felicity;--



<P>and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily



<P>familiarized with any change for the better, it required



<P>several hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any



<P>degree of tranquillity to her heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least

for



<P>a week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him,



<P>it was impossible that less than a week should be given



<P>up to the enjoyment of Elinor's company, or suffice



<P>to say half that was to be said of the past, the present,



<P>and the future;--for though a very few hours spent in



<P>the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more



<P>subjects than can really be in common between any two



<P>rational creatures, yet with lovers it is different.



<P>Between THEM no subject is finished, no communication



<P>is even made, till it has been made at least twenty



<P>times over.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy's marriage, the unceasing and reasonable

wonder



<P>among them all, formed of course one of the earliest



<P>discussions of the lovers;--and Elinor's particular knowledge



<P>of each party made it appear to her in every view, as one



<P>of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances



<P>she had ever heard.&nbsp; How they could be thrown together,



<P>and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry



<P>a girl, of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak



<P>without any admiration,--a girl too already engaged



<P>to his brother, and on whose account that brother had been



<P>thrown off by his family--it was beyond her comprehension



<P>to make out.&nbsp; To her own heart it was a delightful affair,



<P>to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but



<P>to her reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward could only attempt an explanation by

supposing,



<P>that, perhaps, at first accidentally meeting, the vanity



<P>of the one had been so worked on by the flattery



<P>of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.



<P>Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street,



<P>of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother's



<P>affairs might have done, if applied to in time.



<P>She repeated it to Edward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "THAT was exactly like Robert,"--was his immediate



<P>observation.--"And THAT," he presently added, "might



<P>perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between



<P>them first began.&nbsp; And Lucy perhaps at first might



<P>think only of procuring his good offices in my favour.



<P>Other designs might afterward arise."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long it had been carrying on between them,



<P>however, he was equally at a loss with herself to make out;



<P>for at Oxford, where he had remained for choice ever since



<P>his quitting London, he had had no means of hearing of her



<P>but from herself, and her letters to the very last were



<P>neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual.



<P>Not the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred



<P>to prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it



<P>burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself, he had been



<P>for some time, he believed, half stupified between



<P>the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance.



<P>He put the letter into Elinor's hands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "DEAR SIR,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Being very sure

I have long lost your affections,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have thought myself at liberty to bestow

my own



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on another, and have no doubt of being as happy

with



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him as I once used to think I might be with

you;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart

was



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another's.&nbsp; Sincerely wish you happy in

your choice,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it shall not be my fault if we are not

always



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good friends, as our near relationship now

makes



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proper.&nbsp; I can safely say I owe you no

ill-will,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and am sure you will be too generous to do

us any



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ill offices.&nbsp; Your brother has gained

my affections



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entirely, and as we could not live without

one



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another, we are just returned from the altar,

and



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks,

which



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place your dear brother has great curiosity

to see,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but thought I would first trouble you with

these



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; few lines, and shall always remain,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your sincere

well-wisher, friend, and sister,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"LUCY FERRARS.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have burnt

all your letters, and will return



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your picture the first opportunity.&nbsp; Please

to destroy



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my scrawls--but the ring with my hair you are

very



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; welcome to keep."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor read and returned it without any comment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,"



<P>said Edward.--"For worlds would not I have had a letter



<P>of hers seen by YOU in former days.--In a sister it



<P>is bad enough, but in a wife!--how I have blushed over



<P>the pages of her writing!--and I believe I may say that



<P>since the first half year of our foolish--business--this



<P>is the only letter I ever received from her, of which



<P>the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However it may have come about," said Elinor,



<P>after a pause,--"they are certainly married.&nbsp; And your mother



<P>has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment.



<P>The independence she settled on Robert, through resentment



<P>against you, has put it in his power to make his own choice;



<P>and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand



<P>a-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the



<P>other for intending to do.&nbsp; She will hardly be less hurt,



<P>I suppose, by Robert's marrying Lucy, than she would have



<P>been by your marrying her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always



<P>was her favourite.--She will be more hurt by it,



<P>and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what state the affair stood at present between

them,



<P>Edward knew not, for no communication with any of his family



<P>had yet been attempted by him.&nbsp; He had quitted Oxford



<P>within four and twenty hours after Lucy's letter arrived,



<P>and with only one object before him, the nearest road



<P>to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct,



<P>with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection.



<P>He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with



<P>Miss Dashwood; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate,



<P>it is to be supposed, in spite of the jealousy with



<P>which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite



<P>of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts,



<P>and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts,



<P>he did not, upon the whole, expect a very cruel reception.



<P>It was his business, however, to say that he DID, and he



<P>said it very prettily.&nbsp; What he might say on the subject



<P>a twelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination



<P>of husbands and wives.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to

go off



<P>with a flourish of malice against him in her message



<P>by Thomas, was perfectly clear to Elinor; and Edward himself,



<P>now thoroughly enlightened on her character, had no



<P>scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness



<P>of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long opened,



<P>even before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her



<P>ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions--



<P>they had been equally imputed, by him, to her want



<P>of education; and till her last letter reached him,



<P>he had always believed her to be a well-disposed,



<P>good-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself.



<P>Nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented



<P>his putting an end to an engagement, which, long before



<P>the discovery of it laid him open to his mother's anger,



<P>had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought it my duty," said he, "independent

of my feelings,



<P>to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not,



<P>when I was renounced by my mother, and stood to all



<P>appearance without a friend in the world to assist me.



<P>In such a situation as that, where there seemed nothing



<P>to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature,



<P>how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly insisted



<P>on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing



<P>but the most disinterested affection was her inducement?



<P>And even now, I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted,



<P>or what fancied advantage it could be to her, to be



<P>fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard,



<P>and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.



<P>She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No; but she might suppose that something would

occur



<P>in your favour; that your own family might in time relent.



<P>And at any rate, she lost nothing by continuing the engagement,



<P>for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination



<P>nor her actions.&nbsp; The connection was certainly a



<P>respectable one, and probably gained her consideration among



<P>her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred,



<P>it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward was, of course, immediately convinced

that



<P>nothing could have been more natural than Lucy's conduct,



<P>nor more self-evident than the motive of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always

scold



<P>the imprudence which compliments themselves, for having



<P>spent so much time with them at Norland, when he must



<P>have felt his own inconstancy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,"

said she;



<P>"because--to say nothing of my own conviction, our relations



<P>were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT, as you



<P>were THEN situated, could never be."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could only plead an ignorance of his own

heart,



<P>and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was simple enough to think, that because

my FAITH



<P>was plighted to another, there could be no danger in my being



<P>with you; and that the consciousness of my engagement was



<P>to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour.&nbsp; I felt



<P>that I admired you, but I told myself it was only friendship;



<P>and till I began to make comparisons between yourself



<P>and Lucy, I did not know how far I was got.&nbsp; After that,



<P>I suppose, I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex,



<P>and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the



<P>expediency of it, were no better than these:--The danger



<P>is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor smiled, and shook her head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon's



<P>being expected at the Cottage, as he really wished



<P>not only to be better acquainted with him, but to have an



<P>opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented



<P>his giving him the living of Delaford--"Which, at present,"



<P>said he, "after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine



<P>were on the occasion, he must think I have never forgiven



<P>him for offering."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW he felt astonished himself that he had

never yet



<P>been to the place.&nbsp; But so little interest had be taken



<P>in the matter, that he owed all his knowledge of the house,



<P>garden, and glebe, extent of the parish, condition of



<P>the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself,



<P>who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard



<P>it with so much attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One question after this only remained undecided,



<P>between them, one difficulty only was to be overcome.



<P>They were brought together by mutual affection,



<P>with the warmest approbation of their real friends;



<P>their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make



<P>their happiness certain--and they only wanted something



<P>to live upon.&nbsp; Edward had two thousand pounds, and Elinor



<P>one, which, with Delaford living, was all that they could



<P>call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood



<P>should advance anything; and they were neither of them



<P>quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty



<P>pounds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward was not entirely without hopes of some



<P>favourable change in his mother towards him; and on THAT



<P>he rested for the residue of their income.&nbsp; But Elinor



<P>had no such dependence; for since Edward would still



<P>be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself



<P>had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering language



<P>as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele,



<P>she feared that Robert's offence would serve no other



<P>purpose than to enrich Fanny.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About four days after Edward's arrival Colonel



<P>Brandon appeared, to complete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction,



<P>and to give her the dignity of having, for the first time



<P>since her living at Barton, more company with her than



<P>her house would hold.&nbsp; Edward was allowed to retain the



<P>privilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore



<P>walked every night to his old quarters at the Park;



<P>from whence he usually returned in the morning, early enough



<P>to interrupt the lovers' first tete-a-tete before breakfast.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A three weeks' residence at Delaford, where,



<P>in his evening hours at least, he had little to do



<P>but to calculate the disproportion between thirty-six



<P>and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind



<P>which needed all the improvement in Marianne's looks,



<P>all the kindness of her welcome, and all the encouragement



<P>of her mother's language, to make it cheerful.



<P>Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he did revive.



<P>No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him:--he knew



<P>nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his



<P>visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.



<P>Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood,



<P>and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done



<P>for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen

advanced



<P>in the good opinion of each other, as they advanced in each



<P>other's acquaintance, for it could not be otherwise.



<P>Their resemblance in good principles and good sense,



<P>in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably



<P>have been sufficient to unite them in friendship,



<P>without any other attraction; but their being in love



<P>with two sisters, and two sisters fond of each other,



<P>made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,



<P>which might otherwise have waited the effect of time



<P>and judgment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The letters from town, which a few days before

would



<P>have made every nerve in Elinor's body thrill with transport,



<P>now arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth.



<P>Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale, to vent her



<P>honest indignation against the jilting girl, and pour forth



<P>her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she was sure,



<P>had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now,



<P>by all accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.--



<P>"I do think," she continued, "nothing was ever carried



<P>on so sly; for it was but two days before Lucy called



<P>and sat a couple of hours with me.&nbsp; Not a soul suspected



<P>anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!



<P>came crying to me the day after, in a great fright



<P>for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as not knowing how to



<P>get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her



<P>money before she went off to be married, on purpose



<P>we suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not



<P>seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give



<P>her five guineas to take her down to Exeter, where she



<P>thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess,



<P>in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again.



<P>And I must say that Lucy's crossness not to take them



<P>along with them in the chaise is worse than all.



<P>Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot get him out of my head, but you



<P>must send for him to Barton, and Miss Marianne must try to



<P>comfort him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn.



<P>Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women--poor



<P>Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility--and he



<P>considered the existence of each, under such a blow,



<P>with grateful wonder.&nbsp; Robert's offence was unpardonable,



<P>but Lucy's was infinitely worse.&nbsp; Neither of them were



<P>ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even,



<P>if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son,



<P>his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter,



<P>nor be permitted to appear in her presence.&nbsp; The secrecy



<P>with which everything had been carried on between them,



<P>was rationally treated as enormously heightening



<P>the crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred



<P>to the others, proper measures would have been taken



<P>to prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join



<P>with him in regretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward



<P>had not rather been fulfilled, than that she should thus



<P>be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.--



<P>He thus continued:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward's

name,



<P>which does not surprise us; but, to our great astonishment,



<P>not a line has been received from him on the occasion.



<P>Perhaps, however, he is kept silent by his fear of offending,



<P>and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a line



<P>to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter



<P>of proper submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny,



<P>and by her shewn to her mother, might not be taken amiss;



<P>for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars's heart,



<P>and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms



<P>with her children."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This paragraph was of some importance to the



<P>prospects and conduct of Edward.&nbsp; It determined him



<P>to attempt a reconciliation, though not exactly



<P>in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A letter of proper submission!" repeated he;



<P>"would they have me beg my mother's pardon for Robert's



<P>ingratitude to HER, and breach of honour to ME?--I can



<P>make no submission--I am grown neither humble nor



<P>penitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy;



<P>but that would not interest.--I know of no submission



<P>that IS proper for me to make."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may certainly ask to be forgiven," said

Elinor,



<P>"because you have offended;--and I should think you



<P>might NOW venture so far as to profess some concern



<P>for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you



<P>your mother's anger."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He agreed that he might.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little

humility



<P>may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement,



<P>almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had nothing to urge against it, but still



<P>resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission;



<P>and therefore, to make it easier to him, as he declared



<P>a much greater willingness to make mean concessions



<P>by word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that,



<P>instead of writing to Fanny, he should go to London,



<P>and personally intreat her good offices in his favour.--



<P>"And if they really DO interest themselves," said Marianne,



<P>in her new character of candour, "in bringing about



<P>a reconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny



<P>are not entirely without merit."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a visit on Colonel Brandon's side of

only three



<P>or four days, the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.--



<P>They were to go immediately to Delaford, that Edward



<P>might have some personal knowledge of his future home,



<P>and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what



<P>improvements were needed to it; and from thence,



<P>after staying there a couple of nights, he was to proceed



<P>on his journey to town.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor now found the difference between the

expectation



<P>of an unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told



<P>to consider it, and certainty itself.&nbsp; She now found, that



<P>in spite of herself, she had always admitted a hope,



<P>while Edward remained single, that something would occur



<P>to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of



<P>his own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible



<P>opportunity of establishment for the lady, would arise



<P>to assist the happiness of all.&nbsp; But he was now married;



<P>and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery,



<P>which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he should be married soon, before (as

she imagined)



<P>he could be in orders, and consequently before he could



<P>be in possession of the living, surprised her a little



<P>at first.&nbsp; But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy,



<P>in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure him,



<P>should overlook every thing but the risk of delay.



<P>They were married, married in town, and now hastening



<P>down to her uncle's.&nbsp; What had Edward felt on being within



<P>four miles from Barton, on seeing her mother's servant,



<P>on hearing Lucy's message!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They would soon, she supposed, be settled at



<P>Delaford.--Delaford,--that place in which so much



<P>conspired to give her an interest; which she wished



<P>to be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid.



<P>She saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw



<P>in Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once



<P>a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality,



<P>and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;--



<P>pursuing her own interest in every thought, courting the



<P>favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every



<P>wealthy friend.&nbsp; In Edward--she knew not what she saw,



<P>nor what she wished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing



<P>pleased her; she turned away her head from every sketch of him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor flattered herself that some one of their



<P>connections in London would write to them to announce



<P>the event, and give farther particulars,--but day after



<P>day passed off, and brought no letter, no tidings.



<P>Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found



<P>fault with every absent friend.&nbsp; They were all thoughtless



<P>or indolent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma'am?"



<P>was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience



<P>of her mind to have something going on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather



<P>expect to see, than to hear from him again.&nbsp; I earnestly



<P>pressed his coming to us, and should not be surprised



<P>to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was gaining something, something to look

forward to.



<P>Colonel Brandon must have some information to give.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarcely had she so determined it, when the

figure



<P>of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window.



<P>He stopt at their gate.&nbsp; It was a gentleman, it



<P>was Colonel Brandon himself.&nbsp; Now she could hear more;



<P>and she trembled in expectation of it.&nbsp; But--it was



<P>NOT Colonel Brandon--neither his air--nor his height.



<P>Were it possible, she must say it must be Edward.



<P>She looked again.&nbsp; He had just dismounted;--she could not be



<P>mistaken,--it WAS Edward.&nbsp; She moved away and sat down.



<P>"He comes from Mr. Pratt's purposely to see us.&nbsp; I WILL be



<P>calm; I WILL be mistress of myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a moment she perceived that the others were

likewise



<P>aware of the mistake.&nbsp; She saw her mother and Marianne



<P>change colour; saw them look at herself, and whisper



<P>a few sentences to each other.&nbsp; She would have given



<P>the world to be able to speak--and to make them understand



<P>that she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear



<P>in their behaviour to him;--but she had no utterance,



<P>and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a syllable passed aloud.&nbsp; They all

waited



<P>in silence for the appearance of their visitor.



<P>His footsteps were heard along the gravel path; in a moment



<P>he was in the passage, and in another he was before them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His countenance, as he entered the room, was

not



<P>too happy, even for Elinor.&nbsp; His complexion was white



<P>with agitation, and he looked as if fearful of his



<P>reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.



<P>Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted,



<P>to the wishes of that daughter, by whom she then meant



<P>in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing,



<P>met with a look of forced complacency, gave him her hand,



<P>and wished him joy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible

reply.



<P>Elinor's lips had moved with her mother's, and, when the



<P>moment of action was over, she wished that she had shaken



<P>hands with him too.&nbsp; But it was then too late, and with a



<P>countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again



<P>and talked of the weather.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne had retreated as much as possible



<P>out of sight, to conceal her distress; and Margaret,



<P>understanding some part, but not the whole of the case,



<P>thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore



<P>took a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained



<P>a strict silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness



<P>of the season, a very awful pause took place.&nbsp; It was put



<P>an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt obliged to hope that he



<P>had left Mrs. Ferrars very well.&nbsp; In a hurried manner,



<P>he replied in the affirmative.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another pause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing



<P>the sound of her own voice, now said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At Longstaple!" he replied, with an air of

surprise.--



<P>"No, my mother is in town."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I meant," said Elinor, taking up some work

from



<P>the table, "to inquire for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She dared not look up;--but her mother and

Marianne both



<P>turned their eyes on him.&nbsp; He coloured, seemed perplexed,



<P>looked doubtingly, and, after some hesitation, said,--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs.



<P>ROBERT Ferrars."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Robert Ferrars!"--was repeated by Marianne

and her



<P>mother in an accent of the utmost amazement;--and though



<P>Elinor could not speak, even HER eyes were fixed on him



<P>with the same impatient wonder.&nbsp; He rose from his seat,



<P>and walked to the window, apparently from not knowing



<P>what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there,



<P>and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting



<P>the latter to pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps you do not know--you may not have

heard



<P>that my brother is lately married to--to the youngest--to



<P>Miss Lucy Steele."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment



<P>by all but Elinor, who sat with her head leaning over



<P>her work, in a state of such agitation as made her hardly



<P>know where she was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said he, "they were married last week,



<P>and are now at Dawlish."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could sit it no longer.&nbsp; She almost

ran



<P>out of the room, and as soon as the door was closed,



<P>burst into tears of joy, which at first she thought would



<P>never cease.&nbsp; Edward, who had till then looked any where,



<P>rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw--



<P>or even heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards



<P>he fell into a reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries,



<P>no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate,



<P>and at last, without saying a word, quitted the room,



<P>and walked out towards the village--leaving the others



<P>in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change



<P>in his situation, so wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity



<P>which they had no means of lessening but by their



<P>own conjectures.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned

out



<P>very different from what Elinor had expected.&nbsp; She was



<P>prepared to be wet through, fatigued, and frightened;



<P>but the event was still more unfortunate, for they did



<P>not go at all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By ten o'clock the whole party was assembled

at



<P>the park, where they were to breakfast.&nbsp; The morning



<P>was rather favourable, though it had rained all night,



<P>as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,



<P>and the sun frequently appeared.&nbsp; They were all in high



<P>spirits and good humour, eager to be happy, and determined



<P>to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships



<P>rather than be otherwise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While they were at breakfast the letters were

brought in.



<P>Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he



<P>took it, looked at the direction, changed colour,



<P>and immediately left the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the matter with Brandon?" said Sir

John.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody could tell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope he has had no bad news," said Lady

Middleton.



<P>"It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel



<P>Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In about five minutes he returned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No bad news, Colonel, I hope;" said Mrs. Jennings,



<P>as soon as he entered the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "None at all, ma'am, I thank you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Was it from Avignon?&nbsp; I hope it is not

to say



<P>that your sister is worse."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, ma'am. It came from town, and is merely



<P>a letter of business."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But how came the hand to discompose you so

much,



<P>if it was only a letter of business?&nbsp; Come, come,



<P>this won't do, Colonel; so let us hear the truth of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear madam," said Lady Middleton, "recollect

what



<P>you are saying."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin

Fanny



<P>is married?" said Mrs. Jennings, without attending



<P>to her daughter's reproof.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, indeed, it is not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel.&nbsp;

And I



<P>hope she is well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whom do you mean, ma'am?" said he, colouring

a little.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! you know who I mean."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am particularly sorry, ma'am," said he,



<P>addressing Lady Middleton, "that I should receive this



<P>letter today, for it is on business which requires



<P>my immediate attendance in town."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In town!" cried Mrs. Jennings.&nbsp; "What

can you



<P>have to do in town at this time of year?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My own loss is great," be continued, "in being

obliged



<P>to leave so agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned,



<P>as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance



<P>at Whitwell."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a blow upon them all was this!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if you write a note to the housekeeper,

Mr. Brandon,"



<P>said Marianne, eagerly, "will it not be sufficient?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shook his head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We must go," said Sir John.--"It shall not

be put



<P>off when we are so near it.&nbsp; You cannot go to town till



<P>tomorrow, Brandon, that is all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish it could be so easily settled.&nbsp;

But it



<P>is not in my power to delay my journey for one day!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you would but let us know what your business

is,"



<P>said Mrs. Jennings, "we might see whether it could be put



<P>off or not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You would not be six hours later," said Willoughby,



<P>"if you were to defer your journey till our return."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I cannot afford to lose ONE hour."--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low

voice to Marianne,



<P>"There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.



<P>Brandon is one of them.&nbsp; He was afraid of catching cold



<P>I dare say, and invented this trick for getting out of it.



<P>I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no doubt of it," replied Marianne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no persuading you to change your

mind,



<P>Brandon, I know of old," said Sir John, "when once you



<P>are determined on anything.&nbsp; But, however, I hope you



<P>will think better of it.&nbsp; Consider, here are the two Miss



<P>Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods



<P>walked up from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up



<P>two hours before his usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at

being



<P>the cause of disappointing the party; but at the same



<P>time declared it to be unavoidable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then, when will you come back again?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope we shall see you at Barton," added

her ladyship,



<P>"as soon as you can conveniently leave town; and we must



<P>put off the party to Whitwell till you return."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very obliging.&nbsp; But it is so

uncertain,



<P>when I may have it in my power to return, that I dare



<P>not engage for it at all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! he must and shall come back," cried Sir

John.



<P>"If he is not here by the end of the week, I shall go



<P>after him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ay, so do, Sir John," cried Mrs. Jennings,

"and then



<P>perhaps you may find out what his business is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not want to pry into other men's concerns.



<P>I suppose it is something he is ashamed of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon's horses were announced.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You do not go to town on horseback, do you?"



<P>added Sir John.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. Only to Honiton.&nbsp; I shall then go

post."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you



<P>a good journey.&nbsp; But you had better change your mind."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I assure you it is not in my power."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then took leave of the whole party.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there no chance of my seeing you and your

sisters



<P>in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid, none at all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I must bid you farewell for a longer

time



<P>than I should wish to do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come Colonel," said Mrs. Jennings, "before

you go,



<P>do let us know what you are going about."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wished her a good morning, and, attended

by Sir John,



<P>left the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The complaints and lamentations which politeness



<P>had hitherto restrained, now burst forth universally;



<P>and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was



<P>to be so disappointed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can guess what his business is, however,"



<P>said Mrs. Jennings exultingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you, ma'am?" said almost every body.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And who is Miss Williams?" asked Marianne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What! do not you know who Miss Williams is?

I am



<P>sure you must have heard of her before.&nbsp; She is a relation



<P>of the Colonel's, my dear; a very near relation.&nbsp; We will



<P>not say how near, for fear of shocking the young ladies."



<P>Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,



<P>"She is his natural daughter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare.



<P>I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily



<P>in the general regret on so unfortunate an event;



<P>concluding however by observing, that as they were



<P>all got together, they must do something by way of



<P>being happy; and after some consultation it was agreed,



<P>that although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell,



<P>they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving



<P>about the country.&nbsp; The carriages were then ordered;



<P>Willoughby's was first, and Marianne never looked



<P>happier than when she got into it.&nbsp; He drove through



<P>the park very fast, and they were soon out of sight;



<P>and nothing more of them was seen till their return,



<P>which did not happen till after the return of all the rest.



<P>They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said



<P>only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes,



<P>while the others went on the downs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was settled that there should be a dance

in the evening,



<P>and that every body should be extremely merry all day long.



<P>Some more of the Careys came to dinner, and they had the



<P>pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table, which Sir



<P>John observed with great contentment.&nbsp; Willoughby took



<P>his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.



<P>Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not



<P>been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby,



<P>and said to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear,



<P>"I have found you out in spite of all your tricks.



<P>I know where you spent the morning."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily,



<P>"Where, pray?"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did not you know," said Willoughby, "that

we had



<P>been out in my curricle?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very

well,



<P>and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.--



<P>I hope you like your house, Miss Marianne.&nbsp; It is a very



<P>large one, I know; and when I come to see you, I hope you



<P>will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much



<P>when I was there six years ago."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne turned away in great confusion.



<P>Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily; and Elinor found that in her



<P>resolution to know where they had been, she had actually



<P>made her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby's groom;



<P>and that she had by that method been informed that they



<P>had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there



<P>in walking about the garden and going all over the house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could hardly believe this to be true,



<P>as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose,



<P>or Marianne consent, to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was



<P>in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor

enquired



<P>of her about it; and great was her surprise when she



<P>found that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings



<P>was perfectly true.&nbsp; Marianne was quite angry with her



<P>for doubting it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did

not



<P>go there, or that we did not see the house?&nbsp; Is not it



<P>what you have often wished to do yourself?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs.

Smith



<P>was there, and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Willoughby however is the only person

who can



<P>have a right to shew that house; and as he went in an open



<P>carriage, it was impossible to have any other companion.



<P>I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid," replied Elinor, "that the pleasantness



<P>of an employment does not always evince its propriety."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger

proof



<P>of it, Elinor; for if there had been any real impropriety



<P>in what I did, I should have been sensible of it at



<P>the time, for we always know when we are acting wrong,



<P>and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed

you



<P>to some very impertinent remarks, do you not now begin



<P>to doubt the discretion of your own conduct?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings

are



<P>to be the proof of impropriety in conduct, we are all



<P>offending every moment of our lives.&nbsp; I value not her



<P>censure any more than I should do her commendation.



<P>I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking



<P>over Mrs. Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house.



<P>They will one day be Mr. Willoughby's, and--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If they were one day to be your own, Marianne,



<P>you would not be justified in what you have done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly



<P>gratifying to her; and after a ten minutes' interval of



<P>earnest thought, she came to her sister again, and said



<P>with great good humour, "Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS rather



<P>ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted



<P>particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house,



<P>I assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room



<P>up stairs; of a nice comfortable size for constant use,



<P>and with modern furniture it would be delightful.



<P>It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.



<P>On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind



<P>the house, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you



<P>have a view of the church and village, and, beyond them,



<P>of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired.



<P>I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be



<P>more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly



<P>fitted up--a couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says,



<P>would make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms



<P>in England."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption



<P>from the others, she would have described every room



<P>in the house with equal delight.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barton Park was about half a mile from the

cottage.



<P>The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley,



<P>but it was screened from their view at home by the



<P>projection of a hill.&nbsp; The house was large and handsome;



<P>and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality



<P>and elegance.&nbsp; The former was for Sir John's gratification,



<P>the latter for that of his lady.&nbsp; They were scarcely



<P>ever without some friends staying with them in the house,



<P>and they kept more company of every kind than any other



<P>family in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; It was necessary to the



<P>happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper



<P>and outward behaviour, they strongly resembled each other



<P>in that total want of talent and taste which confined



<P>their employments, unconnected with such as society produced,



<P>within a very narrow compass.&nbsp; Sir John was a sportsman,



<P>Lady Middleton a mother.&nbsp; He hunted and shot, and she



<P>humoured her children; and these were their only resources.



<P>Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her



<P>children all the year round, while Sir John's independent



<P>employments were in existence only half the time.



<P>Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,



<P>supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education;



<P>supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise



<P>to the good breeding of his wife.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance



<P>of her table, and of all her domestic arrangements;



<P>and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment



<P>in any of their parties.&nbsp; But Sir John's satisfaction



<P>in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting



<P>about him more young people than his house would hold,



<P>and the noisier they were the better was he pleased.



<P>He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood,



<P>for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold



<P>ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private



<P>balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not



<P>suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arrival of a new family in the country

was always



<P>a matter of joy to him, and in every point of view he was



<P>charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his



<P>cottage at Barton.&nbsp; The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty,



<P>and unaffected.&nbsp; It was enough to secure his good opinion;



<P>for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could



<P>want to make her mind as captivating as her person.



<P>The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in



<P>accommodating those, whose situation might be considered,



<P>in comparison with the past, as unfortunate.&nbsp; In showing



<P>kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction



<P>of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only



<P>in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman;



<P>for a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who



<P>are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging



<P>their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at

the door



<P>of the house by Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton



<P>Park with unaffected sincerity; and as he attended them



<P>to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern



<P>which the same subject had drawn from him the day before,



<P>at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.



<P>They would see, he said, only one gentleman there



<P>besides himself; a particular friend who was staying at



<P>the park, but who was neither very young nor very gay.



<P>He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party,



<P>and could assure them it should never happen so again.



<P>He had been to several families that morning in hopes



<P>of procuring some addition to their number, but it



<P>was moonlight and every body was full of engagements.



<P>Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Barton



<P>within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful



<P>agreeable woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find



<P>it so very dull as they might imagine.&nbsp; The young ladies,



<P>as well as their mother, were perfectly satisfied with



<P>having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for



<P>no more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was

a



<P>good-humoured, merry, fat, elderly woman, who talked a



<P>great deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar.&nbsp; She was full



<P>of jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said



<P>many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands;



<P>hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,



<P>and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.



<P>Marianne was vexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned



<P>her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks,



<P>with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than



<P>could arise from such common-place raillery as Mrs. Jennings's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed

no



<P>more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend,



<P>than Lady Middleton was to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennings



<P>to be Lady Middleton's mother.&nbsp; He was silent and grave.



<P>His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite



<P>of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret



<P>an absolute old bachelor, for he was on the wrong side



<P>of five and thirty; but though his face was not handsome,



<P>his countenance was sensible, and his address was



<P>particularly gentlemanlike.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was nothing in any of the party which

could



<P>recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold



<P>insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive,



<P>that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon,



<P>and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his



<P>mother-in-law was interesting.&nbsp; Lady Middleton seemed



<P>to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her



<P>four noisy children after dinner, who pulled her about,



<P>tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of discourse



<P>except what related to themselves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening, as Marianne was discovered

to be musical,



<P>she was invited to play.&nbsp; The instrument was unlocked,



<P>every body prepared to be charmed, and Marianne,



<P>who sang very well, at their request went through the



<P>chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into



<P>the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain



<P>ever since in the same position on the pianoforte,



<P>for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving



<P>up music, although by her mother's account, she had



<P>played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's performance was highly applauded.



<P>Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song,



<P>and as loud in his conversation with the others while every



<P>song lasted.&nbsp; Lady Middleton frequently called him to order,



<P>wondered how any one's attention could be diverted from music



<P>for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song



<P>which Marianne had just finished.&nbsp; Colonel Brandon alone,



<P>of all the party, heard her without being in raptures.



<P>He paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt



<P>a respect for him on the occasion, which the others had



<P>reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste.



<P>His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that



<P>ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own,



<P>was estimable when contrasted against the horrible



<P>insensibility of the others; and she was reasonable enough



<P>to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have



<P>outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite



<P>power of enjoyment.&nbsp; She was perfectly disposed to make



<P>every allowance for the colonel's advanced state of life



<P>which humanity required.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first part of their journey was performed

in too



<P>melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious



<P>and unpleasant.&nbsp; But as they drew towards the end of it,



<P>their interest in the appearance of a country which they



<P>were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view of



<P>Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.



<P>It was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich



<P>in pasture.&nbsp; After winding along it for more than a mile,



<P>they reached their own house.&nbsp; A small green court was



<P>the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket gate



<P>admitted them into it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was

comfortable



<P>and compact; but as a cottage it was defective, for the



<P>building was regular, the roof was tiled, the window



<P>shutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered



<P>with honeysuckles.&nbsp; A narrow passage led directly through



<P>the house into the garden behind.&nbsp; On each side of the



<P>entrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square;



<P>and beyond them were the offices and the stairs.



<P>Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house.



<P>It had not been built many years and was in good repair.



<P>In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but



<P>the tears which recollection called forth as they entered



<P>the house were soon dried away.&nbsp; They were cheered



<P>by the joy of the servants on their arrival, and each



<P>for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.



<P>It was very early in September; the season was fine,



<P>and from first seeing the place under the advantage



<P>of good weather, they received an impression in its



<P>favour which was of material service in recommending



<P>it to their lasting approbation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation of the house was good.&nbsp;

High hills rose



<P>immediately behind, and at no great distance on each side;



<P>some of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody.



<P>The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills,



<P>and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows.



<P>The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the



<P>whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.



<P>The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated



<P>the valley in that direction; under another name,



<P>and in another course, it branched out again between two



<P>of the steepest of them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the size and furniture of the house Mrs.

Dashwood



<P>was upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former



<P>style of life rendered many additions to the latter



<P>indispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her;



<P>and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all



<P>that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.



<P>"As for the house itself, to be sure," said she, "it is



<P>too small for our family, but we will make ourselves



<P>tolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late



<P>in the year for improvements.&nbsp; Perhaps in the spring,



<P>if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may



<P>think about building.&nbsp; These parlors are both too small



<P>for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often



<P>collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the



<P>passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other,



<P>and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance;



<P>this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added,



<P>and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug



<P>little cottage.&nbsp; I could wish the stairs were handsome.



<P>But one must not expect every thing; though I suppose it



<P>would be no difficult matter to widen them.&nbsp; I shall see



<P>how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring,



<P>and we will plan our improvements accordingly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mean time, till all these alterations

could



<P>be made from the savings of an income of five hundred



<P>a-year by a woman who never saved in her life, they were



<P>wise enough to be contented with the house as it was;



<P>and each of them was busy in arranging their particular



<P>concerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books



<P>and other possessions, to form themselves a home.



<P>Marianne's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of;



<P>and Elinor's drawings were affixed to the walls of their



<P>sitting room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such employments as these they were interrupted



<P>soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of



<P>their landlord, who called to welcome them to Barton,



<P>and to offer them every accommodation from his own house



<P>and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.



<P>Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty.



<P>He had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long



<P>for his young cousins to remember him.&nbsp; His countenance



<P>was thoroughly good-humoured; and his manners were



<P>as friendly as the style of his letter.&nbsp; Their arrival



<P>seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort



<P>to be an object of real solicitude to him.&nbsp; He said much



<P>of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable



<P>terms with his family, and pressed them so cordially



<P>to dine at Barton Park every day till they were better



<P>settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried



<P>to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could



<P>not give offence.&nbsp; His kindness was not confined to words;



<P>for within an hour after he left them, a large basket



<P>full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park,



<P>which was followed before the end of the day by a present



<P>of game.&nbsp; He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their



<P>letters to and from the post for them, and would not be



<P>denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper



<P>every day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message

by him,



<P>denoting her intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as



<P>she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience;



<P>and as this message was answered by an invitation



<P>equally polite, her ladyship was introduced to them the next day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were, of course, very anxious to see a

person on



<P>whom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend; and the



<P>elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes.



<P>Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty;



<P>her face was handsome, her figure tall and striking,



<P>and her address graceful.&nbsp; Her manners had all the elegance



<P>which her husband's wanted.&nbsp; But they would have been



<P>improved by some share of his frankness and warmth;



<P>and her visit was long enough to detract something from



<P>their first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly



<P>well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say



<P>for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir

John



<P>was very chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise



<P>precaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine



<P>little boy about six years old, by which means there was



<P>one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case



<P>of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age,



<P>admire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother



<P>answered for him, while he hung about her and held



<P>down his head, to the great surprise of her ladyship,



<P>who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he



<P>could make noise enough at home.&nbsp; On every formal visit



<P>a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision



<P>for discourse.&nbsp; In the present case it took up ten minutes



<P>to determine whether the boy were most like his father



<P>or mother, and in what particular he resembled either,



<P>for of course every body differed, and every body was



<P>astonished at the opinion of the others.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An opportunity was soon to be given to the

Dashwoods



<P>of debating on the rest of the children, as Sir John



<P>would not leave the house without securing their promise



<P>of dining at the park the next day.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Elinor and Marianne were walking together

the



<P>next morning the latter communicated a piece of news



<P>to her sister, which in spite of all that she knew



<P>before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought,



<P>surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.



<P>Marianne told her, with the greatest delight, that



<P>Willoughby had given her a horse, one that he had bred



<P>himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was



<P>exactly calculated to carry a woman.&nbsp; Without considering



<P>that it was not in her mother's plan to keep any horse,



<P>that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of



<P>this gift, she must buy another for the servant, and



<P>keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable



<P>to receive them, she had accepted the present without



<P>hesitation, and told her sister of it in raptures.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire



<P>immediately for it," she added, "and when it arrives we



<P>will ride every day.&nbsp; You shall share its use with me.



<P>Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the delight of a gallop



<P>on some of these downs."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most unwilling was she to awaken from such

a dream of



<P>felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended



<P>the affair; and for some time she refused to submit to them.



<P>As to an additional servant, the expense would be a trifle;



<P>Mamma she was sure would never object to it; and any horse



<P>would do for HIM; he might always get one at the park;



<P>as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.



<P>Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving



<P>such a present from a man so little, or at least so lately



<P>known to her.&nbsp; This was too much.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are mistaken, Elinor," said she warmly,



<P>"in supposing I know very little of Willoughby.



<P>I have not known him long indeed, but I am much better



<P>acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature



<P>in the world, except yourself and mama.&nbsp; It is not



<P>time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;--



<P>it is disposition alone.&nbsp; Seven years would be insufficient



<P>to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven



<P>days are more than enough for others.&nbsp; I should hold



<P>myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse



<P>from my brother, than from Willoughby.&nbsp; Of John I know



<P>very little, though we have lived together for years;



<P>but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point

no more.



<P>She knew her sister's temper.&nbsp; Opposition on so tender a



<P>subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion.



<P>But by an appeal to her affection for her mother,



<P>by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent



<P>mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be



<P>the case) she consented to this increase of establishment,



<P>Marianne was shortly subdued; and she promised not to



<P>tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning



<P>the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next,



<P>that it must be declined.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby



<P>called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her



<P>express her disappointment to him in a low voice, on



<P>being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present.



<P>The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related,



<P>and they were such as to make further entreaty on his



<P>side impossible.&nbsp; His concern however was very apparent;



<P>and after expressing it with earnestness, he added,



<P>in the same low voice,--"But, Marianne, the horse is



<P>still yours, though you cannot use it now.&nbsp; I shall keep



<P>it only till you can claim it.&nbsp; When you leave Barton



<P>to form your own establishment in a more lasting home,



<P>Queen Mab shall receive you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and

in the



<P>whole of the sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it,



<P>and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone,



<P>she instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning



<P>so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between them.



<P>>From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged



<P>to each other; and the belief of it created no other surprise



<P>than that she, or any of their friends, should be left



<P>by tempers so frank, to discover it by accident.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret related something to her the next

day,



<P>which placed this matter in a still clearer light.



<P>Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them,



<P>and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour



<P>with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity



<P>for observations, which, with a most important face,



<P>she communicated to her eldest sister, when they were



<P>next by themselves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Elinor!" she cried, "I have such a secret

to



<P>tell you about Marianne.&nbsp; I am sure she will be married



<P>to Mr. Willoughby very soon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have said so," replied Elinor, "almost

every



<P>day since they first met on High-church Down; and they



<P>had not known each other a week, I believe, before you



<P>were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck;



<P>but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But indeed this is quite another thing.&nbsp;

I am sure



<P>they will be married very soon, for he has got a lock



<P>of her hair."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take care, Margaret.&nbsp; It may be only

the hair



<P>of some great uncle of HIS."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. I am

almost



<P>sure it is, for I saw him cut it off.&nbsp; Last night



<P>after tea, when you and mama went out of the room,



<P>they were whispering and talking together as fast as



<P>could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her,



<P>and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long



<P>lock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back;



<P>and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper;



<P>and put it into his pocket-book."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For such particulars, stated on such authority,



<P>Elinor could not withhold her credit; nor was she disposed



<P>to it, for the circumstance was in perfect unison with



<P>what she had heard and seen herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed

in a



<P>way so satisfactory to her sister.&nbsp; When Mrs. Jennings



<P>attacked her one evening at the park, to give the name



<P>of the young man who was Elinor's particular favourite,



<P>which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,



<P>Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying,



<P>"I must not tell, may I, Elinor?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor



<P>tried to laugh too.&nbsp; But the effort was painful.



<P>She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person



<P>whose name she could not bear with composure to become



<P>a standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she

did



<P>more harm than good to the cause, by turning very red



<P>and saying in an angry manner to Margaret,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember that whatever your conjectures may

be,



<P>you have no right to repeat them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never had any conjectures about it," replied

Margaret;



<P>"it was you who told me of it yourself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This increased the mirth of the company, and

Margaret



<P>was eagerly pressed to say something more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about

it,"



<P>said Mrs. Jennings.&nbsp; "What is the gentleman's name?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I must not tell, ma'am. But I know very well

what it is;



<P>and I know where he is too."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his

own house



<P>at Norland to be sure.&nbsp; He is the curate of the parish



<P>I dare say."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, THAT he is not.&nbsp; He is of no profession

at all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Margaret," said Marianne with great warmth,



<P>"you know that all this is an invention of your own,



<P>and that there is no such person in existence."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for

I



<P>am sure there was such a man once, and his name begins



<P>with an F."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton



<P>for observing, at this moment, "that it rained very hard,"



<P>though she believed the interruption to proceed less from



<P>any attention to her, than from her ladyship's great dislike



<P>of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted



<P>her husband and mother.&nbsp; The idea however started by her,



<P>was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was



<P>on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others;



<P>and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them.



<P>Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked Marianne



<P>to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours



<P>of different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.



<P>But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into



<P>which it had thrown her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A party was formed this evening for going on

the



<P>following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles



<P>from Barton, belonging to a brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon,



<P>without whose interest it could not be seen, as the proprietor,



<P>who was then abroad, had left strict orders on that head.



<P>The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful,



<P>and Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise,



<P>might be allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had



<P>formed parties to visit them, at least, twice every summer



<P>for the last ten years.&nbsp; They contained a noble piece



<P>of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of



<P>the morning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken,



<P>open carriages only to be employed, and every thing



<P>conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To some few of the company it appeared rather



<P>a bold undertaking, considering the time of year,



<P>and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;--



<P>and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was persuaded



<P>by Elinor to stay at home.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a pity it is, Elinor," said Marianne,



<P>"that Edward should have no taste for drawing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No taste for drawing!" replied Elinor, "why

should



<P>you think so? He does not draw himself, indeed, but he has



<P>great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people,



<P>and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste,



<P>though he has not had opportunities of improving it.



<P>Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would



<P>have drawn very well.&nbsp; He distrusts his own judgment



<P>in such matters so much, that he is always unwilling



<P>to give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate



<P>propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general



<P>direct him perfectly right."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was afraid of offending, and said

no more



<P>on the subject; but the kind of approbation which Elinor



<P>described as excited in him by the drawings of other



<P>people, was very far from that rapturous delight, which,



<P>in her opinion, could alone be called taste.&nbsp; Yet, though



<P>smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured



<P>her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope, Marianne," continued Elinor, "you

do not



<P>consider him as deficient in general taste.&nbsp; Indeed, I think



<P>I may say that you cannot, for your behaviour to him



<P>is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your opinion,



<P>I am sure you could never be civil to him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne hardly knew what to say.&nbsp; She

would



<P>not wound the feelings of her sister on any account,



<P>and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible.



<P>At length she replied:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of

him



<P>is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits.



<P>I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter



<P>propensities of his mind, his inclinations and tastes,



<P>as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world



<P>of his goodness and sense.&nbsp; I think him every thing that is



<P>worthy and amiable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sure," replied Elinor, with a smile,



<P>"that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied



<P>with such commendation as that.&nbsp; I do not perceive



<P>how you could express yourself more warmly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so

easily pleased.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of his sense and his goodness," continued

Elinor,



<P>"no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him



<P>often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation.



<P>The excellence of his understanding and his principles



<P>can be concealed only by that shyness which too often



<P>keeps him silent.&nbsp; You know enough of him to do justice



<P>to his solid worth.&nbsp; But of his minuter propensities,



<P>as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances



<P>been kept more ignorant than myself.&nbsp; He and I have



<P>been at times thrown a good deal together, while you



<P>have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate



<P>principle by my mother.&nbsp; I have seen a great deal of him,



<P>have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on



<P>subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole,



<P>I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed,



<P>enjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively,



<P>his observation just and correct, and his taste delicate



<P>and pure.&nbsp; His abilities in every respect improve



<P>as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.



<P>At first sight, his address is certainly not striking;



<P>and his person can hardly be called handsome, till the



<P>expression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good,



<P>and the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived.



<P>At present, I know him so well, that I think him



<P>really handsome; or at least, almost so.&nbsp; What say you,



<P>Marianne?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor,

if I



<P>do not now.&nbsp; When you tell me to love him as a brother,



<P>I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do



<P>in his heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor started at this declaration, and was

sorry for



<P>the warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.



<P>She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion.



<P>She believed the regard to be mutual; but she required



<P>greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction



<P>of their attachment agreeable to her.&nbsp; She knew that



<P>what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment,



<P>they believed the next--that with them, to wish was to hope,



<P>and to hope was to expect.&nbsp; She tried to explain the real



<P>state of the case to her sister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not attempt to deny," said she, "that

I think



<P>very highly of him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne here burst forth with indignation--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor!

Oh!



<P>worse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.



<P>Use those words again, and I will leave the room this moment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not help laughing.&nbsp; "Excuse

me,"



<P>said she; "and be assured that I meant no offence to you,



<P>by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings.



<P>Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;



<P>believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the



<P>suspicion--the hope of his affection for me may warrant,



<P>without imprudence or folly.&nbsp; But farther than this you must



<P>not believe.&nbsp; I am by no means assured of his regard for me.



<P>There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful;



<P>and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder



<P>at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality,



<P>by believing or calling it more than it is.&nbsp; In my heart



<P>I feel little--scarcely any doubt of his preference.



<P>But there are other points to be considered besides



<P>his inclination.&nbsp; He is very far from being independent.



<P>What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny's



<P>occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have



<P>never been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very



<P>much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there



<P>would be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish



<P>to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or



<P>high rank."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne was astonished to find how much the

imagination



<P>of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you really are not engaged to him!" said

she.



<P>"Yet it certainly soon will happen.&nbsp; But two advantages



<P>will proceed from this delay.&nbsp; I shall not lose you so soon,



<P>and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving



<P>that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must



<P>be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.



<P>Oh! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to



<P>learn to draw himself, how delightful it would be!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister.



<P>She could not consider her partiality for Edward



<P>in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it.



<P>There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which,



<P>if it did not denote indifference, spoke a something almost



<P>as unpromising.&nbsp; A doubt of her regard, supposing him



<P>to feel it, need not give him more than inquietude.



<P>It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind



<P>which frequently attended him.&nbsp; A more reasonable cause



<P>might be found in the dependent situation which forbad



<P>the indulgence of his affection.&nbsp; She knew that his mother



<P>neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable



<P>at present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form



<P>a home for himself, without strictly attending to her views



<P>for his aggrandizement.&nbsp; With such a knowledge as this,



<P>it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.



<P>She was far from depending on that result of his preference



<P>of her, which her mother and sister still considered



<P>as certain.&nbsp; Nay, the longer they were together the more



<P>doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes,



<P>for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more



<P>than friendship.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, whatever might really be its limits, it

was enough,



<P>when perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy,



<P>and at the same time, (which was still more common,)



<P>to make her uncivil.&nbsp; She took the first opportunity of



<P>affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to



<P>her so expressively of her brother's great expectations,



<P>of Mrs. Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should



<P>marry well, and of the danger attending any young woman



<P>who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could



<P>neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm.



<P>She gave her an answer which marked her contempt,



<P>and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might



<P>be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal,



<P>her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week



<P>to such insinuations.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this state of her spirits, a letter was

delivered



<P>to her from the post, which contained a proposal



<P>particularly well timed.&nbsp; It was the offer of a small house,



<P>on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own,



<P>a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.



<P>The letter was from this gentleman himself, and written



<P>in the true spirit of friendly accommodation.



<P>He understood that she was in need of a dwelling;



<P>and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,



<P>he assured her that everything should be done to it which



<P>she might think necessary, if the situation pleased her.



<P>He earnestly pressed her, after giving the particulars



<P>of the house and garden, to come with her daughters to



<P>Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from whence



<P>she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the



<P>houses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration,



<P>be made comfortable to her.&nbsp; He seemed really anxious to



<P>accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written



<P>in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure



<P>to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was



<P>suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her



<P>nearer connections.&nbsp; She needed no time for deliberation



<P>or inquiry.&nbsp; Her resolution was formed as she read.



<P>The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from



<P>Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before,



<P>would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every



<P>possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its



<P>first recommendation.&nbsp; To quit the neighbourhood of Norland



<P>was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire;



<P>it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing



<P>her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever



<P>from that beloved place would be less painful than to



<P>inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress.



<P>She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment



<P>of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;



<P>and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters,



<P>that she might be secure of their approbation before her



<P>answer were sent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor had always thought it would be more

prudent



<P>for them to settle at some distance from Norland,



<P>than immediately amongst their present acquaintance.



<P>On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose



<P>her mother's intention of removing into Devonshire.



<P>The house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so



<P>simple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate,



<P>as to leave her no right of objection on either point;



<P>and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought



<P>any charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from



<P>the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes, she made



<P>no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter



<P>of acquiescence.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more

elegance



<P>than precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage



<P>early the next morning to make his personal enquiries.



<P>He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness;



<P>with a kindness which Sir John's account of him and her own



<P>gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during



<P>the visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance,



<P>mutual affection, and domestic comfort of the family



<P>to whom accident had now introduced him.&nbsp; Of their



<P>personal charms he had not required a second interview



<P>to be convinced.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion,



<P>regular features, and a remarkably pretty figure.



<P>Marianne was still handsomer.&nbsp; Her form, though not so



<P>correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of height,



<P>was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when



<P>in the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl,



<P>truth was less violently outraged than usually happens.



<P>Her skin was very brown, but, from its transparency,



<P>her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her features



<P>were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive;



<P>and in her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life,



<P>a spirit, an eagerness, which could hardily be seen



<P>without delight.&nbsp; From Willoughby their expression was at



<P>first held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance



<P>of his assistance created.&nbsp; But when this passed away,



<P>when her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the



<P>perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness



<P>and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,



<P>that of music and dancing he was passionately fond,



<P>she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the



<P>largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest



<P>of his stay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only necessary to mention any favourite



<P>amusement to engage her to talk.&nbsp; She could not be



<P>silent when such points were introduced, and she



<P>had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.



<P>They speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing



<P>and music was mutual, and that it arose from a general



<P>conformity of judgment in all that related to either.



<P>Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions,



<P>she proceeded to question him on the subject of books;



<P>her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt



<P>upon with so rapturous a delight, that any young man of



<P>five and twenty must have been insensible indeed, not to



<P>become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works,



<P>however disregarded before.&nbsp; Their taste was strikingly alike.



<P>The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--



<P>or if any difference appeared, any objection arose,



<P>it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments



<P>and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed.



<P>He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm;



<P>and long before his visit concluded, they conversed



<P>with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Marianne," said Elinor, as soon as he

had left them,



<P>"for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well.



<P>You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in



<P>almost every matter of importance.&nbsp; You know what he thinks



<P>of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating



<P>their beauties as he ought, and you have received every



<P>assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.



<P>But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such



<P>extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?



<P>You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic.



<P>Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments



<P>on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then



<P>you can have nothing farther to ask."--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Elinor," cried Marianne, "is this fair? is

this



<P>just? are my ideas so scanty?&nbsp; But I see what you mean.



<P>I have been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank.



<P>I have erred against every common-place notion of decorum;



<P>I have been open and sincere where I ought to have



<P>been reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had



<P>I talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I



<P>spoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have



<P>been spared."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My love," said her mother, "you must not be

offended



<P>with Elinor--she was only in jest.&nbsp; I should scold



<P>her myself, if she were capable of wishing to check



<P>the delight of your conversation with our new friend."--



<P>Marianne was softened in a moment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of

his



<P>pleasure in their acquaintance, which an evident wish



<P>of improving it could offer.&nbsp; He came to them every day.



<P>To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse; but the



<P>encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave



<P>greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it



<P>had ceased to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery.



<P>She was confined for some days to the house; but never had



<P>any confinement been less irksome.&nbsp; Willoughby was a young



<P>man of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits,



<P>and open, affectionate manners.&nbsp; He was exactly formed



<P>to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined



<P>not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour



<P>of mind which was now roused and increased by the example



<P>of her own, and which recommended him to her affection



<P>beyond every thing else.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His society became gradually her most exquisite

enjoyment.



<P>They read, they talked, they sang together; his musical



<P>talents were considerable; and he read with all the



<P>sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless



<P>as in Marianne's; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him



<P>but a propensity, in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly



<P>delighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on



<P>every occasion, without attention to persons or circumstances.



<P>In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people,



<P>in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment



<P>of undivided attention where his heart was engaged,



<P>and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety,



<P>he displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve,



<P>in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation



<P>which had seized her at sixteen and a half, of ever



<P>seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection,



<P>had been rash and unjustifiable.&nbsp; Willoughby was all



<P>that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour



<P>and in every brighter period, as capable of attaching her;



<P>and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect



<P>as earnest, as his abilities were strong.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative



<P>thought of their marriage had been raised, by his prospect



<P>of riches, was led before the end of a week to hope and



<P>expect it; and secretly to congratulate herself on having



<P>gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne,

which had



<P>so early been discovered by his friends, now first became



<P>perceptible to Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed



<P>by them.&nbsp; Their attention and wit were drawn off to his



<P>more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other



<P>had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed



<P>when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule



<P>so justly annexed to sensibility.&nbsp; Elinor was obliged,



<P>though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments which



<P>Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction,



<P>were now actually excited by her sister; and that however



<P>a general resemblance of disposition between the parties



<P>might forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally



<P>striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the



<P>regard of Colonel Brandon.&nbsp; She saw it with concern;



<P>for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope,



<P>when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty? and as



<P>she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished



<P>him indifferent.&nbsp; She liked him--in spite of his gravity



<P>and reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest.



<P>His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve



<P>appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits



<P>than of any natural gloominess of temper.&nbsp; Sir John



<P>had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments,



<P>which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man,



<P>and she regarded him with respect and compassion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more



<P>because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne,



<P>who, prejudiced against him for being neither lively



<P>nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brandon is just the kind of man," said Willoughby



<P>one day, when they were talking of him together,



<P>"whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about;



<P>whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers



<P>to talk to."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is exactly what I think of him," cried

Marianne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not boast of it, however," said Elinor,

"for it



<P>is injustice in both of you.&nbsp; He is highly esteemed



<P>by all the family at the park, and I never see him myself



<P>without taking pains to converse with him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That he is patronised by YOU," replied Willoughby,



<P>"is certainly in his favour; but as for the esteem



<P>of the others, it is a reproach in itself.&nbsp; Who would



<P>submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman



<P>as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command



<P>the indifference of any body else?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself



<P>and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady



<P>Middleton and her mother.&nbsp; If their praise is censure,



<P>your censure may be praise, for they are not more undiscerning,



<P>than you are prejudiced and unjust."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In defence of your protege you can even be

saucy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My protege, as you call him, is a sensible

man;



<P>and sense will always have attractions for me.



<P>Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty.



<P>He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad,



<P>has read, and has a thinking mind.&nbsp; I have found him



<P>capable of giving me much information on various subjects;



<P>and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of



<P>good-breeding and good nature."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is to say," cried Marianne contemptuously,



<P>"he has told you, that in the East Indies the climate is hot,



<P>and the mosquitoes are troublesome."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had

I made



<P>any such inquiries, but they happened to be points



<P>on which I had been previously informed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps," said Willoughby, "his observations

may



<P>have extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs,



<P>and palanquins."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I may venture to say that HIS observations



<P>have stretched much further than your candour.



<P>But why should you dislike him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not dislike him.&nbsp; I consider him,

on the contrary,



<P>as a very respectable man, who has every body's good word,



<P>and nobody's notice; who, has more money than he can spend,



<P>more time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats



<P>every year."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Add to which," cried Marianne, "that he has



<P>neither genius, taste, nor spirit.&nbsp; That his understanding



<P>has no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice



<P>no expression."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You decide on his imperfections so much in

the mass,"



<P>replied Elinor, "and so much on the strength of your



<P>own imagination, that the commendation I am able to give



<P>of him is comparatively cold and insipid.&nbsp; I can only



<P>pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred, well-informed,



<P>of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Dashwood," cried Willoughby, "you are

now using



<P>me unkindly.&nbsp; You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason,



<P>and to convince me against my will.&nbsp; But it will not do.



<P>You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful.&nbsp; I have



<P>three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon;



<P>he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine;



<P>he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle,



<P>and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare.&nbsp; If it



<P>will be any satisfaction to you, however, to be told,



<P>that I believe his character to be in other respects



<P>irreproachable, I am ready to confess it.&nbsp; And in return



<P>for an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain,



<P>you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much



<P>as ever."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of

Edward's



<P>conduct, but only Elinor and Marianne understood its



<P>true merit.&nbsp; THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt



<P>him to be disobedient, and how small was the consolation,



<P>beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could



<P>remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune.



<P>Elinor gloried in his integrity; and Marianne forgave all



<P>his offences in compassion for his punishment.&nbsp; But though



<P>confidence between them was, by this public discovery,



<P>restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on



<P>which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.



<P>Elinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still



<P>more upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too positive



<P>assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's continued



<P>affection for herself which she rather wished to do away;



<P>and Marianne's courage soon failed her, in trying



<P>to converse upon a topic which always left her more



<P>dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison



<P>it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She felt all the force of that comparison;

but not



<P>as her sister had hoped, to urge her to exertion now;



<P>she felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach,



<P>regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted



<P>herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,



<P>without the hope of amendment.&nbsp; Her mind was so much weakened



<P>that she still fancied present exertion impossible,



<P>and therefore it only dispirited her more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or

two afterwards,



<P>of affairs in Harley Street, or Bartlett's Buildings.



<P>But though so much of the matter was known to them already,



<P>that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading



<P>that knowledge farther, without seeking after more,



<P>she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort



<P>and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could;



<P>and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual,



<P>had prevented her going to them within that time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third day succeeding their knowledge of

the



<P>particulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw



<P>many to Kensington Gardens, though it was only the second



<P>week in March.&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number;



<P>but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were again



<P>in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them,



<P>chose rather to stay at home, than venture into so public



<P>a place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined



<P>them soon after they entered the Gardens, and Elinor was



<P>not sorry that by her continuing with them, and engaging



<P>all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she was herself left



<P>to quiet reflection.&nbsp; She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,



<P>nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody



<P>who could by any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting



<P>to her.&nbsp; But at last she found herself with some surprise,



<P>accosted by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy,



<P>expressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving



<P>encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings,



<P>left her own party for a short time, to join their's.



<P>Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get it all out of her, my dear.&nbsp; She

will tell you



<P>any thing if you ask.&nbsp; You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's

curiosity



<P>and Elinor's too, that she would tell any thing WITHOUT



<P>being asked; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so glad to meet you;" said Miss Steele,



<P>taking her familiarly by the arm--"for I wanted to see you



<P>of all things in the world."&nbsp; And then lowering her voice,



<P>"I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it.



<P>Is she angry?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not at all, I believe, with you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a good thing.&nbsp; And Lady Middleton,

is SHE angry?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I cannot suppose it possible that she should."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am monstrous glad of it.&nbsp; Good gracious!&nbsp;

I have



<P>had such a time of it!&nbsp; I never saw Lucy in such a rage



<P>in my life.&nbsp; She vowed at first she would never trim me



<P>up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again,



<P>so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to,



<P>and we are as good friends as ever.&nbsp; Look, she made me



<P>this bow to my hat, and put in the feather last night.



<P>There now, YOU are going to laugh at me too.&nbsp; But why



<P>should not I wear pink ribbons?&nbsp; I do not care if it IS



<P>the Doctor's favourite colour.&nbsp; I am sure, for my part,



<P>I should never have known he DID like it better than



<P>any other colour, if he had not happened to say so.



<P>My cousins have been so plaguing me!&nbsp; I declare sometimes



<P>I do not know which way to look before them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had wandered away to a subject on which

Elinor



<P>had nothing to say, and therefore soon judged it expedient



<P>to find her way back again to the first.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, but Miss Dashwood," speaking triumphantly,



<P>"people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars's



<P>declaring he would not have Lucy, for it is no such thing



<P>I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such ill-natured



<P>reports to be spread abroad.&nbsp; Whatever Lucy might think



<P>about it herself, you know, it was no business of other



<P>people to set it down for certain."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never heard any thing of the kind hinted

at before,



<P>I assure you," said Elinor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, did not you?&nbsp; But it WAS said, I

know, very well,



<P>and by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks,



<P>that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars



<P>to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty thousand



<P>pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had



<P>nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself.



<P>And besides that, my cousin Richard said himself,



<P>that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars



<P>would be off; and when Edward did not come near us



<P>for three days, I could not tell what to think myself;



<P>and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost;



<P>for we came away from your brother's Wednesday,



<P>and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday,



<P>and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him.



<P>Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits



<P>rose against that.&nbsp; However this morning he came just



<P>as we came home from church; and then it all came out,



<P>how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street,



<P>and been talked to by his mother and all of them,



<P>and how he had declared before them all that he loved



<P>nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have.



<P>And how he had been so worried by what passed,



<P>that as soon as he had went away from his mother's house,



<P>he had got upon his horse, and rid into the country,



<P>some where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn



<P>all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better



<P>of it.&nbsp; And after thinking it all over and over again,



<P>he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune,



<P>and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep



<P>her on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss,



<P>for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope



<P>of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders,



<P>as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy,



<P>and how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear



<P>to think of her doing no better, and so he begged,



<P>if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the



<P>matter directly, and leave him shift for himself.



<P>I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be.



<P>And it was entirely for HER sake, and upon HER account,



<P>that he said a word about being off, and not upon his own.



<P>I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being



<P>tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any



<P>thing like it.&nbsp; But, to be sure, Lucy would not give



<P>ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly



<P>(with a great deal about sweet and love, you know,



<P>and all that--Oh, la! one can't repeat such kind of things



<P>you know)--she told him directly, she had not the least



<P>mind in the world to be off, for she could live with him



<P>upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have,



<P>she should be very glad to have it all, you know,



<P>or something of the kind.&nbsp; So then he was monstrous happy,



<P>and talked on some time about what they should do,



<P>and they agreed he should take orders directly,



<P>and they must wait to be married till he got a living.



<P>And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin



<P>called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in



<P>her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens;



<P>so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them,



<P>to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did not



<P>care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put



<P>on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the



<P>Richardsons."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not understand what you mean by interrupting

them,"



<P>said Elinor; "you were all in the same room together,



<P>were not you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, indeed, not us.&nbsp; La! Miss Dashwood,

do you



<P>think people make love when any body else is by?&nbsp; Oh,



<P>for shame!--To be sure you must know better than that.



<P>(Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in the



<P>drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening



<P>at the door."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How!" cried Elinor; "have you been repeating

to me



<P>what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door?



<P>I am sorry I did not know it before; for I certainly



<P>would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a



<P>conversation which you ought not to have known yourself.



<P>How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, la! there is nothing in THAT.&nbsp; I

only stood at



<P>the door, and heard what I could.&nbsp; And I am sure Lucy would



<P>have done just the same by me; for a year or two back,



<P>when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together,



<P>she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind



<P>a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor tried to talk of something else; but

Miss



<P>Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes,



<P>from what was uppermost in her mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Edward talks of going to Oxford soon," said

she;



<P>"but now he is lodging at No. --, Pall Mall.&nbsp; What an



<P>ill-natured woman his monther is, an't she? And your



<P>brother and sister were not very kind! However,



<P>I shan't say anything against them to YOU; and to be sure



<P>they did send us home in their own chariot, which



<P>was more than I looked for.&nbsp; And for my part, I was all



<P>in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the



<P>huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,



<P>nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine



<P>out of sight.&nbsp; Edward have got some business at Oxford,



<P>he says; so he must go there for a time; and after THAT,



<P>as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he will be ordained.



<P>I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious!



<P>(giggling as she spoke) I'd lay my life I know what



<P>my cousins will say, when they hear of it.&nbsp; They will



<P>tell me I should write to the Doctor, to get Edward



<P>the curacy of his new living.&nbsp; I know they will; but I am



<P>sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.--



<P>'La!' I shall say directly, 'I wonder how you could think



<P>of such a thing?&nbsp; I write to the Doctor, indeed!'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," said Elinor, "it is a comfort to be

prepared



<P>against the worst.&nbsp; You have got your answer ready."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Steele was going to reply on the same

subject,



<P>but the approach of her own party made another more necessary.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, la! here come the Richardsons.&nbsp; I

had a vast deal



<P>more to say to you, but I must not stay away from them not



<P>any longer.&nbsp; I assure you they are very genteel people.



<P>He makes a monstrous deal of money, and they keep their



<P>own coach.&nbsp; I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about



<P>it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she



<P>is not in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same;



<P>and if anything should happen to take you and your



<P>sister away, and Mrs. Jennings should want company,



<P>I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her



<P>for as long a time as she likes.&nbsp; I suppose Lady Middleton



<P>won't ask us any more this bout.&nbsp; Good-by; I am sorry



<P>Miss Marianne was not here.&nbsp; Remember me kindly to her.



<P>La! if you have not got your spotted muslin on!--I wonder



<P>you was not afraid of its being torn."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such was her parting concern; for after this,

she had



<P>time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings,



<P>before her company was claimed by Mrs. Richardson;



<P>and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which



<P>might feed her powers of reflection some time, though she



<P>had learnt very little more than what had been already



<P>foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind.&nbsp; Edward's marriage



<P>with Lucy was as firmly determined on, and the time



<P>of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain,



<P>as she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended,



<P>exactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment,



<P>of which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as they returned to the carriage,



<P>Mrs. Jennings was eager for information; but as Elinor



<P>wished to spread as little as possible intelligence



<P>that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained,



<P>she confined herself to the brief repetition of such



<P>simple particulars, as she felt assured that Lucy,



<P>for the sake of her own consequence, would choose



<P>to have known.&nbsp; The continuance of their engagement,



<P>and the means that were able to be taken for promoting



<P>its end, was all her communication; and this produced



<P>from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for his having a living!--ay, we all

know how



<P>THAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding



<P>no good comes of it, will set down upon a curacy of fifty



<P>pounds a-year, with the interest of his two thousand pounds,



<P>and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can



<P>give her.--Then they will have a child every year! and



<P>Lord help 'em! how poor they will be!--I must see



<P>what I can give them towards furnishing their house.



<P>Two maids and two men, indeed!--as I talked of t'other



<P>day.--No, no, they must get a stout girl of all works.--



<P>Betty's sister would never do for them NOW."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning brought Elinor a letter by

the



<P>two-penny post from Lucy herself.&nbsp; It was as follows:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"Bartlett's Building, March.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope my dear

Miss Dashwood will excuse the



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; liberty I take of writing to her; but I know

your



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; friendship for me will make you pleased to

hear such



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a good account of myself and my dear Edward,

after



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the troubles we have went through lately,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore will make no more apologies, but

proceed



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to say that, thank God! though we have suffered



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and

as happy



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as we must always be in one another's love.&nbsp;

We have



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had great trials, and great persecutions, but



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many friends, yourself not the least among

them,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose great kindness I shall always thankfully



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remember, as will Edward too, who I have told

of



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it.&nbsp; I am sure you will be glad to hear,

as likewise



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours

with



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him yesterday afternoon, he would not hear

of our



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought

my



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; duty required, urge him to it for prudence

sake,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and would have parted for ever on the spot,

would



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he consent to it; but he said it should never

be,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he did not regard his mother's anger, while

he could



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have my affections; our prospects are not very



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope

for



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the best; he will be ordained shortly; and

should



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it ever be in your power to recommend him to

any



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; body that has a living to bestow, am very sure

you



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings

too,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trust she will speak a good word for us to

Sir John,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able

to



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assist us.--Poor Anne was much to blame for

what



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she did, but she did it for the best, so I

say



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won't think it

too much



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trouble to give us a call, should she come

this way



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any morning, 'twould be a great kindness, and

my



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cousins would be proud to know her.--My paper

reminds



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and respectfully remembered to her, and to

Sir John,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Lady Middleton, and the dear children,

when you



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"I am, &amp;c."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed



<P>what she concluded to be its writer's real design,



<P>by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings, who read it



<P>aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye,



<P>that was quite proper to let him be off if he would.



<P>That was just like Lucy.--Poor soul! I wish I COULD get



<P>him a living, with all my heart.--She calls me dear



<P>Mrs. Jennings, you see.&nbsp; She is a good-hearted girl



<P>as ever lived.--Very well upon my word.&nbsp; That sentence



<P>is very prettily turned.&nbsp; Yes, yes, I will go and see her,



<P>sure enough.&nbsp; How attentive she is, to think of every



<P>body!--Thank you, my dear, for shewing it me.&nbsp; It is



<P>as pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy's head



<P>and heart great credit."

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more

than



<P>two months in town, and Marianne's impatience to be gone



<P>increased every day.&nbsp; She sighed for the air, the liberty,



<P>the quiet of the country; and fancied that if any place



<P>could give her ease, Barton must do it.&nbsp; Elinor was hardly



<P>less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much



<P>less bent on its being effected immediately, as that she



<P>was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey,



<P>which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge.



<P>She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards



<P>its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes



<P>to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the



<P>eloquence of her good-will, when a plan was suggested,



<P>which, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks



<P>longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible



<P>than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland



<P>about the end of March, for the Easter holidays;



<P>and Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, received a very



<P>warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them.&nbsp; This would



<P>not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy of



<P>Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real



<P>politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very



<P>great amendment of his manners towards them since her



<P>sister had been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept



<P>it with pleasure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she told Marianne what she had done, however,



<P>her first reply was not very auspicious.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cleveland!"--she cried, with great agitation.



<P>"No, I cannot go to Cleveland."--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You forget," said Elinor gently, "that its

situation



<P>is not...that it is not in the neighbourhood of..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it is in Somersetshire.--I cannot go



<P>into Somersetshire.--There, where I looked forward



<P>to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to go there."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of

overcoming



<P>such feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by



<P>working on others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure



<P>which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother,



<P>whom she so much wished to see, in a more eligible,



<P>more comfortable manner, than any other plan could do,



<P>and perhaps without any greater delay.&nbsp; From Cleveland,



<P>which was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to



<P>Barton was not beyond one day, though a long day's journey;



<P>and their mother's servant might easily come there to attend



<P>them down; and as there could be no occasion of their



<P>staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at



<P>home in little more than three weeks' time.&nbsp; As Marianne's



<P>affection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph



<P>with little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of

her guest,



<P>that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again



<P>from Cleveland.&nbsp; Elinor was grateful for the attention,



<P>but it could not alter her design; and their mother's



<P>concurrence being readily gained, every thing relative



<P>to their return was arranged as far as it could be;--



<P>and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement



<P>of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I

shall



<P>do without the Miss Dashwoods;"--was Mrs. Jennings's



<P>address to him when he first called on her, after their



<P>leaving her was settled--"for they are quite resolved



<P>upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we



<P>shall be, when I come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape



<P>at one another as dull as two cats."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this

vigorous



<P>sketch of their future ennui, to provoke him to make



<P>that offer, which might give himself an escape from it;--



<P>and if so, she had soon afterwards good reason to think



<P>her object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to the window



<P>to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print,



<P>which she was going to copy for her friend, he followed



<P>her to it with a look of particular meaning, and conversed



<P>with her there for several minutes.&nbsp; The effect of his



<P>discourse on the lady too, could not escape her observation,



<P>for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even



<P>changed her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear,



<P>to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne



<P>was playing, she could not keep herself from seeing



<P>that Elinor changed colour, attended with agitation,



<P>and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.--



<P>Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval



<P>of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another,



<P>some words of the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear,



<P>in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness



<P>of his house.&nbsp; This set the matter beyond a doubt.



<P>She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary



<P>to do so; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.



<P>What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish,



<P>but judged from the motion of her lips, that she did



<P>not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings



<P>commended her in her heart for being so honest.



<P>They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her



<P>catching a syllable, when another lucky stop in Marianne's



<P>performance brought her these words in the Colonel's calm



<P>voice,--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid it cannot take place very soon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a

speech,



<P>she was almost ready to cry out, "Lord! what should



<P>hinder it?"--but checking her desire, confined herself



<P>to this silent ejaculation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is very strange!--sure he need not wait



<P>to be older."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This delay on the Colonel's side, however,

did not



<P>seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least,



<P>for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards,



<P>and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard



<P>Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I shall always think myself very much obliged

to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude,



<P>and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence,



<P>the Colonel should be able to take leave of them, as he



<P>immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away



<P>without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old



<P>friend could have made so indifferent a suitor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What had really passed between them was to

this effect.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have heard," said he, with great compassion,



<P>"of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered



<P>from his family; for if I understand the matter right,



<P>he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering



<P>in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.--



<P>Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor told him that it was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,"--he replied,



<P>with great feeling,--"of dividing, or attempting to divide,



<P>two young people long attached to each other, is terrible.--



<P>Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing--what



<P>she may drive her son to.&nbsp; I have seen Mr. Ferrars two



<P>or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased



<P>with him.&nbsp; He is not a young man with whom one can



<P>be intimately acquainted in a short time, but I have



<P>seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake,



<P>and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.



<P>I understand that he intends to take orders.&nbsp; Will you



<P>be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford,



<P>now just vacant, as I am informed by this day's post,



<P>is his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but THAT,



<P>perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now,



<P>it may be&nbsp; nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it



<P>were more&nbsp; valuable.-- It is a rectory, but a small one;



<P>the late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than



<P>200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable



<P>of improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as



<P>to afford him a very comfortable income.&nbsp; Such as it is,



<P>however, my pleasure in presenting him to it,



<P>will be very great.&nbsp; Pray assure him of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's astonishment at this commission could



<P>hardly have been greater, had the Colonel been really



<P>making her an offer of his hand.&nbsp; The preferment,



<P>which only two days before she had considered as hopeless



<P>for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--



<P>and SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to



<P>bestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had



<P>attributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor



<P>feelings less pure, less pleasing, might have a share



<P>in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,



<P>and her gratitude for the particular friendship,



<P>which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act,



<P>were strongly felt, and warmly expressed.&nbsp; She thanked him



<P>for it with all her heart, spoke of Edward's principles and



<P>disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve;



<P>and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure,



<P>if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office



<P>to another.&nbsp; But at the same time, she could not help



<P>thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself.



<P>It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give



<P>Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER,



<P>she would have been very glad to be spared herself;--



<P>but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy,



<P>declining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being



<P>given through her means, that she would not on any account



<P>make farther opposition.&nbsp; Edward, she believed, was still in town,



<P>and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele.



<P>She could undertake therefore to inform him of it,



<P>in the course of the day.&nbsp; After this had been settled,



<P>Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage



<P>in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour,



<P>and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret, that the



<P>house was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor,



<P>as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very light of,



<P>at least as far as regarded its size.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The smallness of the house," said she,



<P>"I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them,



<P>for it will be in proportion to their family and income."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By which the Colonel was surprised to find

that SHE



<P>was considering Mr. Ferrars's marriage as the certain



<P>consequence of the presentation; for he did not suppose it



<P>possible that Delaford living could supply such an income,



<P>as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on--



<P>and he said so.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This little rectory CAN do no more than make

Mr. Ferrars



<P>comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry.



<P>I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this;



<P>and my interest is hardly more extensive.&nbsp; If, however,



<P>by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve



<P>him farther, I must think very differently of him



<P>from what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful



<P>to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present.



<P>What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all,



<P>since it can advance him so little towards what must



<P>be his principal, his only object of happiness.



<P>His marriage must still be a distant good;--at least,



<P>I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood,



<P>so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings;



<P>but after this narration of what really passed between



<P>Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at the window,



<P>the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may



<P>perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited,



<P>nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from



<P>an offer of marriage.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined



<P>when they first came into Devonshire, that so many



<P>engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly



<P>presented themselves, or that they should have such frequent



<P>invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little



<P>leisure for serious employment.&nbsp; Yet such was the case.



<P>When Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home



<P>and abroad, which Sir John had been previously forming,



<P>were put into execution.&nbsp; The private balls at the park



<P>then began; and parties on the water were made and



<P>accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.



<P>In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included;



<P>and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended



<P>these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing



<P>intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to afford



<P>him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne,



<P>of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,



<P>in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance



<P>of her affection.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment.



<P>She only wished that it were less openly shewn; and once



<P>or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some



<P>self-command to Marianne.&nbsp; But Marianne abhorred all



<P>concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;



<P>and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not



<P>in themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely



<P>an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection



<P>of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.



<P>Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at



<P>all times, was an illustration of their opinions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was present she had no eyes for any

one else.



<P>Every thing he did, was right.&nbsp; Every thing he said, was clever.



<P>If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards,



<P>he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get



<P>her a good hand.&nbsp; If dancing formed the amusement



<P>of the night, they were partners for half the time;



<P>and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances,



<P>were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word



<P>to any body else.&nbsp; Such conduct made them of course



<P>most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame,



<P>and seemed hardly to provoke them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings

with



<P>a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this



<P>excessive display of them.&nbsp; To her it was but the natural



<P>consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the season of happiness to Marianne.



<P>Her heart was devoted to Willoughby, and the fond attachment



<P>to Norland, which she brought with her from Sussex,



<P>was more likely to be softened than she had thought it



<P>possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed



<P>on her present home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's happiness was not so great.&nbsp;

Her heart was not



<P>so much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements



<P>so pure.&nbsp; They afforded her no companion that could make



<P>amends for what she had left behind, nor that could teach



<P>her to think of Norland with less regret than ever.



<P>Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply



<P>to her the conversation she missed; although the latter



<P>was an everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded



<P>her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of



<P>her discourse.&nbsp; She had already repeated her own history



<P>to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been



<P>equal to her means of improvement, she might have known



<P>very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of



<P>Mr. Jenning's last illness, and what he said to his wife



<P>a few minutes before he died.&nbsp; Lady Middleton was more



<P>agreeable than her mother only in being more silent.



<P>Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her



<P>reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense



<P>had nothing to do.&nbsp; Towards her husband and mother she



<P>was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore



<P>neither to be looked for nor desired.&nbsp; She had nothing



<P>to say one day that she had not said the day before.



<P>Her insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were



<P>always the same; and though she did not oppose the parties



<P>arranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted



<P>in style and her two eldest children attended her,



<P>she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them



<P>than she might have experienced in sitting at home;--



<P>and so little did her presence add to the pleasure



<P>of the others, by any share in their conversation,



<P>that they were sometimes only reminded of her being



<P>amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance,



<P>did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the



<P>respect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship,



<P>or give pleasure as a companion.&nbsp; Willoughby was out



<P>of the question.&nbsp; Her admiration and regard, even her



<P>sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover;



<P>his attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less



<P>agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing.



<P>Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such



<P>encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing



<P>with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the



<P>indifference of her sister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she

had reason



<P>to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already



<P>been known to him.&nbsp; This suspicion was given by some words



<P>which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park,



<P>when they were sitting down together by mutual consent,



<P>while the others were dancing.&nbsp; His eyes were fixed



<P>on Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes,



<P>he said, with a faint smile, "Your sister, I understand,



<P>does not approve of second attachments."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," replied Elinor, "her opinions are all

romantic."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or rather, as I believe, she considers them



<P>impossible to exist."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe she does.&nbsp; But how she contrives

it



<P>without reflecting on the character of her own father,



<P>who had himself two wives, I know not.&nbsp; A few years



<P>however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis



<P>of common sense and observation; and then they may be



<P>more easy to define and to justify than they now are,



<P>by any body but herself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This will probably be the case," he replied;



<P>"and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices



<P>of a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way



<P>to the reception of more general opinions."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I cannot agree with you there," said Elinor.



<P>"There are inconveniences attending such feelings



<P>as Marianne's, which all the charms of enthusiasm and



<P>ignorance of the world cannot atone for.&nbsp; Her systems have



<P>all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought;



<P>and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look



<P>forward to as her greatest possible advantage."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short pause he resumed the conversation



<P>by saying,--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does your sister make no distinction in her

objections



<P>against a second attachment? or is it equally criminal



<P>in every body?&nbsp; Are those who have been disappointed



<P>in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy



<P>of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances,



<P>to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the

minutiae



<P>of her principles.&nbsp; I only know that I never yet heard her



<P>admit any instance of a second attachment's being pardonable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This," said he, "cannot hold; but a change,



<P>a total change of sentiments--No, no, do not desire it;



<P>for when the romantic refinements of a young mind



<P>are obliged to give way, how frequently are they



<P>succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too



<P>dangerous!&nbsp; I speak from experience.&nbsp; I once knew a lady



<P>who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister,



<P>who thought and judged like her, but who from an inforced



<P>change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances"--



<P>Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said



<P>too much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures,



<P>which might not otherwise have entered Elinor's head.



<P>The lady would probably have passed without suspicion,



<P>had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned



<P>her ought not to escape his lips.&nbsp; As it was,



<P>it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his



<P>emotion with the tender recollection of past regard.



<P>Elinor attempted no more.&nbsp; But Marianne, in her place,



<P>would not have done so little.&nbsp; The whole story would



<P>have been speedily formed under her active imagination;



<P>and every thing established in the most melancholy order



<P>of disastrous love.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs.

Dashwood



<P>indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her



<P>son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house,



<P>and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were



<P>ready for her inhabiting it.&nbsp; They heard her with surprise.



<P>Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly



<P>hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland.



<P>She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going



<P>into Devonshire.--Edward turned hastily towards her,



<P>on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise and concern,



<P>which required no explanation to her, repeated,



<P>"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there?&nbsp; So far from hence!



<P>And to what part of it?"&nbsp; She explained the situation.



<P>It was within four miles northward of Exeter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is but a cottage," she continued, "but

I hope



<P>to see many of my friends in it.&nbsp; A room or two can



<P>easily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty



<P>in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find



<P>none in accommodating them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She concluded with a very kind invitation to



<P>Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton;



<P>and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection.



<P>Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had



<P>made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than



<P>was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect



<P>on her in that point to which it principally tended.



<P>To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her



<P>object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood,



<P>by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she



<P>disregarded her disapprobation of the match.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and

again



<P>how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at



<P>such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any



<P>service to her in removing her furniture.&nbsp; He really felt



<P>conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion



<P>to which he had limited the performance of his promise to



<P>his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.--



<P>The furniture was all sent around by water.&nbsp; It chiefly



<P>consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books,



<P>with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's.&nbsp; Mrs. John



<P>Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could



<P>not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income



<P>would be so trifling in comparison with their own,



<P>she should have any handsome article of furniture.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth;

it was



<P>ready furnished, and she might have immediate possession.



<P>No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she



<P>waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland,



<P>and to determine her future household, before she set



<P>off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid



<P>in the performance of everything that interested her,



<P>was soon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband



<P>had been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity



<P>now offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed



<P>to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her



<P>eldest daughter.&nbsp; For the comfort of her children, had she



<P>consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it;



<P>but the discretion of Elinor prevailed.&nbsp; HER wisdom



<P>too limited the number of their servants to three;



<P>two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided



<P>from amongst those who had formed their establishment



<P>at Norland.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man and one of the maids were sent off

immediately



<P>into Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress's



<P>arrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown



<P>to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the



<P>cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she relied



<P>so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house,



<P>as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she



<P>entered it as her own.&nbsp; Her eagerness to be gone from Norland



<P>was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction



<P>of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal;



<P>a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed



<P>under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.



<P>Now was the time when her son-in-law's promise to his



<P>father might with particular propriety be fulfilled.



<P>Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to



<P>the estate, their quitting his house might be looked



<P>on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment.



<P>But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every



<P>hope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the general



<P>drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no



<P>farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.



<P>He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses



<P>of housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse,



<P>which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond



<P>calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand



<P>in need of more money himself than to have any design of



<P>giving money away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a very few weeks from the day which brought

Sir



<P>John Middleton's first letter to Norland, every thing was



<P>so far settled in their future abode as to enable



<P>Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many were the tears shed by them in their last



<P>adieus to a place so much beloved.&nbsp; "Dear, dear Norland!"



<P>said Marianne, as she wandered alone before the house,



<P>on the last evening of their being there; "when shall I cease



<P>to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh!



<P>happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing



<P>you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view



<P>you no more!--And you, ye well-known trees!--but you



<P>will continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we



<P>are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we



<P>can observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same;



<P>unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion,



<P>and insensible of any change in those who walk under your



<P>shade!--But who will remain to enjoy you?"

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the house-maid had lit their fire the

next day,



<P>or the sun gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning



<P>in January, Marianne, only half dressed, was kneeling



<P>against one of the window-seats for the sake of all



<P>the little light she could command from it, and writing



<P>as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her.



<P>In this situation, Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation



<P>and sobs, first perceived her; and after observing her



<P>for a few moments with silent anxiety, said, in a tone



<P>of the most considerate gentleness,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marianne, may I ask-?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Elinor," she replied, "ask nothing; you

will



<P>soon know all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sort of desperate calmness with which this

was said,



<P>lasted no longer than while she spoke, and was immediately



<P>followed by a return of the same excessive affliction.



<P>It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter,



<P>and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her,



<P>at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of her



<P>feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing



<P>for the last time to Willoughby.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive

attention



<P>in her power; and she would have tried to sooth and



<P>tranquilize her still more, had not Marianne entreated her,



<P>with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability,



<P>not to speak to her for the world.&nbsp; In such circumstances,



<P>it was better for both that they should not be long together;



<P>and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only prevented



<P>her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed,



<P>but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place,



<P>made her wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding



<P>the sight of every body.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted

to eat



<P>any thing; and Elinor's attention was then all employed,



<P>not in urging her, not in pitying her, nor in appearing



<P>to regard her, but in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jenning's



<P>notice entirely to herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings,



<P>it lasted a considerable time, and they were just setting



<P>themselves, after it, round the common working table, when a



<P>letter was delivered to Marianne, which she eagerly caught



<P>from the servant, and, turning of a death-like paleness,



<P>instantly ran out of the room.&nbsp; Elinor, who saw as plainly



<P>by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must



<P>come from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness



<P>at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head,



<P>and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it



<P>impossible to escape Mrs. Jenning's notice.&nbsp; That good lady,



<P>however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter



<P>from Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke,



<P>and which she treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh,



<P>that she would find it to her liking.&nbsp; Of Elinor's distress,



<P>she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted



<P>for her rug, to see any thing at all; and calmly continuing



<P>her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so



<P>desperately in love in my life!&nbsp; MY girls were nothing



<P>to her, and yet they used to be foolish enough; but as



<P>for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature.



<P>I hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won't keep her



<P>waiting much longer, for it is quite grievous to see her



<P>look so ill and forlorn.&nbsp; Pray, when are they to be married?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, though never less disposed to speak

than at



<P>that moment, obliged herself to answer such an attack



<P>as this, and, therefore, trying to smile, replied, "And have



<P>you really, Ma'am, talked yourself into a persuasion



<P>of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?&nbsp; I thought



<P>it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems



<P>to imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not



<P>deceive yourself any longer.&nbsp; I do assure you that nothing



<P>would surprise me more than to hear of their being going



<P>to be married."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can

you



<P>talk so?&nbsp; Don't we all know that it must be a match, that



<P>they were over head and ears in love with each other from



<P>the first moment they met?&nbsp; Did not I see them together



<P>in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I



<P>know that your sister came to town with me on purpose



<P>to buy wedding clothes?&nbsp; Come, come, this won't do.



<P>Because you are so sly about it yourself, you think nobody



<P>else has any senses; but it is no such thing, I can tell you,



<P>for it has been known all over town this ever so long.



<P>I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed, Ma'am," said Elinor, very seriously,



<P>"you are mistaken.&nbsp; Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing



<P>in spreading the report, and you will find that you have



<P>though you will not believe me now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had

not



<P>spirits to say more, and eager at all events to know



<P>what Willoughby had written, hurried away to their room,



<P>where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne stretched on



<P>the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,



<P>and two or three others laying by her.&nbsp; Elinor drew near,



<P>but without saying a word; and seating herself on the bed,



<P>took her hand, kissed her affectionately several times,



<P>and then gave way to a burst of tears, which at first



<P>was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. The latter,



<P>though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness



<P>of this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in



<P>joint affliction, she put all the letters into Elinor's hands;



<P>and then covering her face with her handkerchief,



<P>almost screamed with agony.&nbsp; Elinor, who knew that such grief,



<P>shocking as it was to witness it, must have its course,



<P>watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat



<P>spent itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby's letter,



<P>read as follows:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"Bond Street, January.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "MY DEAR MADAM,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have just

had the honour of receiving your



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; letter, for which I beg to return my sincere



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acknowledgments.&nbsp; I am much concerned

to find there



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was anything in my behaviour last night that

did



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not meet your approbation; and though I am

quite at



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a loss to discover in what point I could be

so



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forgiveness of what I can assure you to have

been



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perfectly unintentional.&nbsp; I shall never

reflect on



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my former acquaintance with your family in

Devonshire



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myself it will not be broken by any mistake

or



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; misapprehension of my actions.&nbsp; My esteem

for your



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole family is very sincere; but if I have

been so



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of

more than



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach

myself



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for not having been more guarded in my professions



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of that esteem.&nbsp; That I should ever have

meant more



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you will allow to be impossible, when you understand



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this engagement is fulfilled.&nbsp; It is with

great



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regret that I obey your commands in returning

the



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; letters with which I have been honoured from

you,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly

bestowed



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am, dear Madam,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"Your most obedient



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"humble servant,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"JOHN WILLOUGHBY."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With what indignation such a letter as this

must



<P>be read by Miss Dashwood, may be imagined.&nbsp; Though aware,



<P>before she began it, that it must bring a confession



<P>of his inconstancy, and confirm their separation for ever,



<P>she was not aware that such language could be suffered



<P>to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby



<P>capable of departing so far from the appearance of every



<P>honourable and delicate feeling--so far from the common



<P>decorum of a gentleman, as to send a letter so impudently



<P>cruel: a letter which, instead of bringing with his desire



<P>of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no



<P>breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever--



<P>a letter of which every line was an insult, and which



<P>proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused over it for some time with indignant



<P>astonishment; then read it again and again; but every



<P>perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man,



<P>and so bitter were her feelings against him, that she



<P>dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound



<P>Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement,



<P>not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an



<P>escape from the worst and most irremediable of all



<P>evils, a connection, for life, with an unprincipled man,



<P>as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her earnest meditations on the contents

of the letter,



<P>on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it,



<P>and probably, on the very different mind of a very different



<P>person, who had no other connection whatever with the affair



<P>than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed,



<P>Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister,



<P>forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread,



<P>and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room,



<P>that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door,



<P>she went to the window to see who could be coming so



<P>unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to perceive



<P>Mrs. Jennings's chariot, which she knew had not been



<P>ordered till one.&nbsp; Determined not to quit Marianne,



<P>though hopeless of contributing, at present, to her ease,



<P>she hurried away to excuse herself from attending



<P>Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being indisposed.



<P>Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern



<P>for its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor,



<P>after seeing her safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she



<P>found attempting to rise from the bed, and whom she reached



<P>just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor,



<P>faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food;



<P>for it was many days since she had any appetite, and many



<P>nights since she had really slept; and now, when her



<P>mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense,



<P>the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head,



<P>a weakened stomach, and a general nervous faintness.



<P>A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,



<P>made her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express



<P>some sense of her kindness, by saying,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make you!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only wish," replied her sister, "there were



<P>any thing I COULD do, which might be of comfort to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, as every thing else would have been,



<P>was too much for Marianne, who could only exclaim,



<P>in the anguish of her heart, "Oh! Elinor, I am miserable,



<P>indeed," before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could no longer witness this torrent



<P>of unresisted grief in silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exert yourself, dear Marianne," she cried,



<P>"if you would not kill yourself and all who love you.



<P>Think of your mother; think of her misery while YOU suffer:



<P>for her sake you must exert yourself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I cannot, I cannot," cried Marianne; "leave

me,



<P>leave me, if I distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me!



<P>but do not torture me so.&nbsp; Oh! how easy for those,



<P>who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion!&nbsp; Happy,



<P>happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what I suffer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you call ME happy, Marianne?&nbsp; Ah!

if you knew!--And



<P>can you believe me to be so, while I see you so wretched!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forgive me, forgive me," throwing her arms

round



<P>her sister's neck; "I know you feel for me; I know what



<P>a heart you have; but yet you are--you must be happy;



<P>Edward loves you--what, oh what, can do away such happiness



<P>as that?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Many, many circumstances," said Elinor, solemnly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, no," cried Marianne wildly, "he loves

you,



<P>and only you.&nbsp; You CAN have no grief."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can have no pleasure while I see you in

this state."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you will never see me otherwise.&nbsp;

Mine is



<P>a misery which nothing can do away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must not talk so, Marianne.&nbsp; Have

you no



<P>comforts? no friends?&nbsp; Is your loss such as leaves



<P>no opening for consolation?&nbsp; Much as you suffer now,



<P>think of what you would have suffered if the discovery



<P>of his character had been delayed to a later period--



<P>if your engagement had been carried on for months and months,



<P>as it might have been, before he chose to put an end to it.



<P>Every additional day of unhappy confidence, on your side,



<P>would have made the blow more dreadful."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Engagement!" cried Marianne, "there has been



<P>no engagement."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No engagement!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him.



<P>He has broken no faith with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But he told you that he loved you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes--no--never absolutely.&nbsp; It was every

day implied,



<P>but never professedly declared.&nbsp; Sometimes I thought it



<P>had been--but it never was."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yet you wrote to him?"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes--could that be wrong after all that had

passed?--



<P>But I cannot talk."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor said no more, and turning again to the

three



<P>letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity



<P>than before, directly ran over the contents of all.



<P>The first, which was what her sister had sent him



<P>on their arrival in town, was to this effect.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Berkeley Street, January.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How surprised

you will be, Willoughby, on



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; receiving this; and I think you will feel something



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than surprise, when you know that I am

in town.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An opportunity of coming hither, though with

Mrs.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jennings, was a temptation we could not resist.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish you may receive this in time to come

here



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to-night, but I will not depend on it.&nbsp;

At any rate



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall expect you to-morrow. For the present,

adieu.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"M.D."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her second note, which had been written on

the morning



<P>after the dance at the Middletons', was in these words:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I cannot express

my disappointment in having



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; missed you the day before yesterday, nor my

astonishment



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at not having received any answer to a note

which



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sent you above a week ago.&nbsp; I have been

expecting



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to hear from you, and still more to see you,

every



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hour of the day.&nbsp; Pray call again as soon

as possible,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and explain the reason of my having expected

this



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in vain.&nbsp; You had better come earlier

another time,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because we are generally out by one.&nbsp;

We were last



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; night at Lady Middleton's, where there was

a dance.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been told that you were asked to be

of the



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; party.&nbsp; But could it be so?&nbsp; You

must be very much



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; altered indeed since we parted, if that could

be



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the case, and you not there.&nbsp; But I will

not suppose



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this possible, and I hope very soon to receive

your



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; personal assurance of its being otherwise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"M.D."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contents of her last note to him were these:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What am I to

imagine, Willoughby, by your



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behaviour last night?&nbsp; Again I demand

an explanation



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of it.&nbsp; I was prepared to meet you with

the pleasure



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which our separation naturally produced, with

the



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to me to justify.&nbsp; I was repulsed indeed!

I have



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passed a wretched night in endeavouring to

excuse



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a conduct which can scarcely be called less

than



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; insulting; but though I have not yet been able

to



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; form any reasonable apology for your behaviour,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am perfectly ready to hear your justification

of



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it.&nbsp; You have perhaps been misinformed,

or purposely



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deceived, in something concerning me, which

may have



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lowered me in your opinion.&nbsp; Tell me what

it is,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explain the grounds on which you acted, and

I shall



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be satisfied, in being able to satisfy you.&nbsp;

It



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think

ill



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of you; but if I am to do it, if I am to learn

that



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you are not what we have hitherto believed

you, that



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your regard for us all was insincere, that

your



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behaviour to me was intended only to deceive,

let



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it be told as soon as possible.&nbsp; My feelings

are at



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; present in a state of dreadful indecision;

I wish



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to acquit you, but certainty on either side

will be



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ease to what I now suffer.&nbsp; If your sentiments

are



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer what they were, you will return my

notes,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"M.D."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That such letters, so full of affection and

confidence,



<P>could have been so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby's sake,



<P>would have been unwilling to believe.&nbsp; But her condemnation



<P>of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their



<P>having been written at all; and she was silently grieving



<P>over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited



<P>proofs of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding,



<P>and most severely condemned by the event, when Marianne,



<P>perceiving that she had finished the letters, observed to



<P>her that they contained nothing but what any one would



<P>have written in the same situation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I felt myself," she added, "to be as solemnly



<P>engaged to him, as if the strictest legal covenant



<P>had bound us to each other."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can believe it," said Elinor; "but unfortunately



<P>he did not feel the same."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He DID feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and

weeks he



<P>felt it.&nbsp; I know he did.&nbsp; Whatever may have changed him now,

(and



<P>nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done



<P>it), I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish.



<P>This lock of hair, which now he can so readily give up,



<P>was begged of me with the most earnest supplication.



<P>Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his voice



<P>at that moment!&nbsp; Have you forgot the last evening of our



<P>being together at Barton?&nbsp; The morning that we parted



<P>too!&nbsp; When he told me that it might be many weeks before



<P>we met again--his distress--can I ever forget his distress?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment or two she could say no more;



<P>but when this emotion had passed away, she added,



<P>in a firmer tone,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not

by Willoughby."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dearest Marianne, who but himself?&nbsp; By

whom can he



<P>have been instigated?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By all the world, rather than by his own heart.



<P>I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance



<P>leagued together to ruin me in his opinion, than believe



<P>his nature capable of such cruelty.&nbsp; This woman of whom he



<P>writes--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but your own



<P>dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous



<P>to bely me.&nbsp; Beyond you three, is there a creature



<P>in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil



<P>than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor would not contend, and only replied,



<P>"Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy, let them



<P>be cheated of their malignant triumph, my dear sister,



<P>by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own



<P>innocence and good intentions supports your spirits.



<P>It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists



<P>such malevolence."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no," cried Marianne, "misery such as mine

has



<P>no pride.&nbsp; I care not who knows that I am wretched.



<P>The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world.



<P>Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be proud and



<P>independent as they like--may resist insult, or return



<P>mortification--but I cannot.&nbsp; I must feel--I must be



<P>wretched--and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness



<P>of it that can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But for my mother's sake and mine--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would do more than for my own.&nbsp; But

to appear



<P>happy when I am so miserable--Oh! who can require it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again they were both silent.&nbsp; Elinor was

employed



<P>in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window,



<P>from the window to the fire, without knowing that she



<P>received warmth from one, or discerning objects through



<P>the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,



<P>with her head leaning against one of its posts,



<P>again took up Willoughby's letter, and, after shuddering



<P>over every sentence, exclaimed--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby,

could this



<P>be yours!&nbsp; Cruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you.&nbsp; Elinor,



<P>nothing can.&nbsp; Whatever he might have heard against me--



<P>ought he not to have suspended his belief? ought he not to



<P>have told me of it, to have given me the power of clearing



<P>myself? 'The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)



<P>which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable.



<P>Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?



<P>Oh, barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Marianne, in no possible way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And yet this woman--who knows what her art

may



<P>have been?--how long it may have been premeditated,



<P>and how deeply contrived by her!--Who is she?--Who can



<P>she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and



<P>attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! no one,



<P>no one--he talked to me only of myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another pause ensued; Marianne was greatly

agitated,



<P>and it ended thus.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Elinor, I must go home.&nbsp; I must go and

comfort mama.



<P>Can not we be gone to-morrow?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To-morrow, Marianne!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for



<P>Willoughby's sake--and now who cares for me? Who regards me?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We

owe



<P>Mrs. Jennings much more than civility; and civility of



<P>the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but

I cannot



<P>stay here long, I cannot stay to endure the questions



<P>and remarks of all these people.&nbsp; The Middletons and



<P>Palmers--how am I to bear their pity?&nbsp; The pity of such



<P>a woman as Lady Middleton!&nbsp; Oh, what would HE say to that!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor advised her to lie down again, and for

a



<P>moment she did so; but no attitude could give her ease;



<P>and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one



<P>posture to another, till growing more and more hysterical,



<P>her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all,



<P>and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call



<P>for assistance.&nbsp; Some lavender drops, however, which she



<P>was at length persuaded to take, were of use; and from



<P>that time till Mrs. Jennings returned, she continued



<P>on the bed quiet and motionless.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The family of Dashwood had long been settled

in Sussex.



<P>Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park,



<P>in the centre of their property, where, for many generations,



<P>they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage



<P>the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance.



<P>The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived



<P>to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life,



<P>had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.



<P>But her death, which happened ten years before his own,



<P>produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply



<P>her loss, he invited and received into his house the family



<P>of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor



<P>of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended



<P>to bequeath it.&nbsp; In the society of his nephew and niece,



<P>and their children, the old Gentleman's days were



<P>comfortably spent.&nbsp; His attachment to them all increased.



<P>The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood



<P>to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest,



<P>but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid



<P>comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness



<P>of the children added a relish to his existence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had

one



<P>son: by his present lady, three daughters.&nbsp; The son,



<P>a steady respectable young man, was amply provided



<P>for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,



<P>and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.



<P>By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards,



<P>he added to his wealth.&nbsp; To him therefore the succession



<P>to the Norland estate was not so really important as to



<P>his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might



<P>arise to them from their father's inheriting that property,



<P>could be but small.&nbsp; Their mother had nothing, and their



<P>father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal;



<P>for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was



<P>also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest



<P>in it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old gentleman died: his will was read,

and



<P>like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment



<P>as pleasure.&nbsp; He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful,



<P>as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him



<P>on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest.



<P>Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his



<P>wife and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to



<P>his son, and his son's son, a child of four years old,



<P>it was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself



<P>no power of providing for those who were most dear



<P>to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge



<P>on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods.



<P>The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who,



<P>in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland,



<P>had so far gained on the affections of his uncle,



<P>by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children



<P>of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation,



<P>an earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks,



<P>and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value



<P>of all the attention which, for years, he had received



<P>from his niece and her daughters.&nbsp; He meant not to



<P>be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection



<P>for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first,

severe;



<P>but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might



<P>reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically,



<P>lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate



<P>already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement.



<P>But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his



<P>only one twelvemonth.&nbsp; He survived his uncle no longer;



<P>and ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies,



<P>was all that remained for his widow and daughters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His son was sent for as soon as his danger

was known,



<P>and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength



<P>and urgency which illness could command, the interest



<P>of his mother-in-law and sisters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings

of the



<P>rest of the family; but he was affected by a recommendation



<P>of such a nature at such a time, and he promised to do



<P>every thing in his power to make them comfortable.



<P>His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,



<P>and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how



<P>much there might prudently be in his power to do for them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless

to



<P>be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be



<P>ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected;



<P>for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge



<P>of his ordinary duties.&nbsp; Had he married a more amiable woman,



<P>he might have been made still more respectable than he



<P>was:--he might even have been made amiable himself; for he



<P>was very young when he married, and very fond of his wife.



<P>But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;--



<P>more narrow-minded and selfish.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he gave his promise to his father, he

meditated



<P>within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters



<P>by the present of a thousand pounds a-piece.&nbsp; He then



<P>really thought himself equal to it.&nbsp; The prospect of four



<P>thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,



<P>besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune,



<P>warmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.--



<P>"Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would



<P>be liberal and handsome! It would be enough to make



<P>them completely easy.&nbsp; Three thousand pounds! he could



<P>spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience."--



<P>He thought of it all day long, and for many days successively,



<P>and he did not repent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sooner was his father's funeral over, than

Mrs. John



<P>Dashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her



<P>mother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants.



<P>No one could dispute her right to come; the house was



<P>her husband's from the moment of his father's decease;



<P>but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater,



<P>and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only



<P>common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--



<P>but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen,



<P>a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind,



<P>by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source



<P>of immoveable disgust.&nbsp; Mrs. John Dashwood had never



<P>been a favourite with any of her husband's family;



<P>but she had had no opportunity, till the present,



<P>of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort



<P>of other people she could act when occasion required it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious



<P>behaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her



<P>daughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter,



<P>she would have quitted the house for ever, had not the



<P>entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect



<P>on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all



<P>her three children determined her afterwards to stay,



<P>and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice

was



<P>so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding,



<P>and coolness of judgment, which qualified her,



<P>though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother,



<P>and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage



<P>of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood



<P>which must generally have led to imprudence.&nbsp; She had



<P>an excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate,



<P>and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern



<P>them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn;



<P>and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne's abilities were, in many respects,



<P>quite equal to Elinor's. She was sensible and clever;



<P>but eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have



<P>no moderation.&nbsp; She was generous, amiable, interesting: she



<P>was everything but prudent.&nbsp; The resemblance between



<P>her and her mother was strikingly great.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her



<P>sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued



<P>and cherished.&nbsp; They encouraged each other now in the



<P>violence of their affliction.&nbsp; The agony of grief



<P>which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed,



<P>was sought for, was created again and again.&nbsp; They gave



<P>themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase



<P>of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it,



<P>and resolved against ever admitting consolation



<P>in future.&nbsp; Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still



<P>she could struggle, she could exert herself.&nbsp; She could



<P>consult with her brother, could receive her sister-in-law



<P>on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention;



<P>and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion,



<P>and encourage her to similar forbearance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored,



<P>well-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed



<P>a good deal of Marianne's romance, without having



<P>much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair



<P>to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took

place



<P>the next day, and two of her daughters went with her;



<P>but Marianne excused herself from being of the party,



<P>under some trifling pretext of employment; and her mother,



<P>who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby



<P>the night before of calling on her while they were absent,



<P>was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On their return from the park they found Willoughby's



<P>curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage,



<P>and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture



<P>had been just.&nbsp; So far it was all as she had foreseen;



<P>but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight



<P>had taught her to expect.&nbsp; They were no sooner in the



<P>passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour



<P>apparently in violent affliction, with her handkerchief



<P>at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.



<P>Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room



<P>she had just quitted, where they found only Willoughby,



<P>who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back



<P>towards them.&nbsp; He turned round on their coming in,



<P>and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook



<P>of the emotion which over-powered Marianne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is anything the matter with her?" cried Mrs.

Dashwood



<P>as she entered--"is she ill?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope not," he replied, trying to look cheerful;



<P>and with a forced smile presently added, "It is I who may



<P>rather expect to be ill--for I am now suffering under a



<P>very heavy disappointment!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Disappointment?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement

with you.



<P>Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege



<P>of riches upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on



<P>business to London.&nbsp; I have just received my dispatches,



<P>and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of exhilaration



<P>I am now come to take my farewell of you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To London!--and are you going this morning?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost this moment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is very unfortunate.&nbsp; But Mrs. Smith

must



<P>be obliged;--and her business will not detain you from



<P>us long I hope."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He coloured as he replied, "You are very kind,

but I



<P>have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately.



<P>My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within



<P>the twelvemonth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?&nbsp;

Is Allenham the only



<P>house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?



<P>For shame, Willoughby, can you wait for an invitation here?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed



<P>on the ground he only replied, "You are too good."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.



<P>Elinor felt equal amazement.&nbsp; For a few moments every one



<P>was silent.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood first spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that

at



<P>Barton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not



<P>press you to return here immediately, because you only



<P>can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith;



<P>and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question



<P>your judgment than to doubt your inclination."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My engagements at present," replied Willoughby,



<P>confusedly, "are of such a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopt.&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood was too much

astonished



<P>to speak, and another pause succeeded.&nbsp; This was broken



<P>by Willoughby, who said with a faint smile, "It is folly



<P>to linger in this manner.&nbsp; I will not torment myself



<P>any longer by remaining among friends whose society



<P>it is impossible for me now to enjoy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then hastily took leave of them all and

left



<P>the room.&nbsp; They saw him step into his carriage,



<P>and in a minute it was out of sight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and

instantly



<P>quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern



<P>and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her

mother's.



<P>She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.



<P>Willoughby's behaviour in taking leave of them, his embarrassment,



<P>and affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness



<P>to accept her mother's invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover,



<P>so unlike himself, greatly disturbed her.&nbsp; One moment she feared



<P>that no serious design had ever been formed on his side; and the



<P>next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and



<P>her sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room



<P>was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for,



<P>though when she considered what Marianne's love for him was,



<P>a quarrel seemed almost impossible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But whatever might be the particulars of their

separation,



<P>her sister's affliction was indubitable; and she thought



<P>with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow



<P>which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving



<P>way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In about half an hour her mother returned,

and though



<P>her eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from

Barton, Elinor,"



<P>said she, as she sat down to work, "and with how heavy a heart



<P>does he travel?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is all very strange.&nbsp; So suddenly

to be gone! It



<P>seems but the work of a moment.&nbsp; And last night he was



<P>with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?&nbsp; And now,



<P>after only ten minutes notice--Gone too without intending



<P>to return!--Something more than what be owned to us must



<P>have happened.&nbsp; He did not speak, he did not behave



<P>like himself.&nbsp; YOU must have seen the difference as well as I.



<P>What can it be?&nbsp; Can they have quarrelled?&nbsp; Why else should

he



<P>have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor;

I could



<P>plainly see THAT.&nbsp; He had not the power of accepting it.



<P>I have thought it all over I assure you, and I can



<P>perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed



<P>strange to me as well as to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you, indeed!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. I have explained it to myself in the

most



<P>satisfactory way;--but you, Elinor, who love to doubt



<P>where you can--it will not satisfy YOU, I know; but you



<P>shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.&nbsp; I am persuaded



<P>that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne,



<P>disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views



<P>for him,) and on that account is eager to get him away;--



<P>and that the business which she sends him off to transact



<P>is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.&nbsp; This is what I



<P>believe to have happened.&nbsp; He is, moreover, aware that she



<P>DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore



<P>at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne,



<P>and he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation,



<P>to give into her schemes, and absent himself from



<P>Devonshire for a while.&nbsp; You will tell me, I know,



<P>that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen



<P>to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method



<P>of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this.



<P>And now, Elinor, what have you to say?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you would have told me, that it might

or might not



<P>have happened.&nbsp; Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your



<P>feelings!&nbsp; You had rather take evil upon credit than good.



<P>You had rather look out for misery for Marianne, and guilt



<P>for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the latter.



<P>You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took



<P>leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour



<P>has shewn.&nbsp; And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence,



<P>or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?&nbsp; Are



<P>no probabilities to be accepted, merely because they



<P>are not certainties?&nbsp; Is nothing due to the man whom we



<P>have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world



<P>to think ill of?&nbsp; To the possibility of motives unanswerable



<P>in themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while?&nbsp; And,



<P>after all, what is it you suspect him of?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can hardly tell myself.&nbsp; But suspicion

of



<P>something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence



<P>of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him.



<P>There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged



<P>of the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it



<P>is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body.



<P>Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient



<P>reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.



<P>But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge



<P>them at once.&nbsp; Secrecy may be advisable; but still I



<P>cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not blame him, however, for departing from



<P>his character, where the deviation is necessary.



<P>But you really do admit the justice of what I have said



<P>in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not entirely.&nbsp; It may be proper to conceal

their



<P>engagement (if they ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--



<P>and if that is the case, it must be highly expedient



<P>for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present.



<P>But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you

accuse



<P>Willoughby and Marianne of concealment? This is strange



<P>indeed, when your eyes have been reproaching them every day



<P>for incautiousness."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want no proof of their affection," said

Elinor;



<P>"but of their engagement I do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am perfectly satisfied of both."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yet not a syllable has been said to you on

the



<P>subject, by either of them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have not wanted syllables where actions

have



<P>spoken so plainly.&nbsp; Has not his behaviour to Marianne



<P>and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight,



<P>declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife,



<P>and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest



<P>relation?&nbsp; Have we not perfectly understood each other?



<P>Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his manner,



<P>his attentive and affectionate respect?&nbsp; My Elinor,



<P>is it possible to doubt their engagement?&nbsp; How could



<P>such a thought occur to you?&nbsp; How is it to be supposed



<P>that Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your



<P>sister's love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps



<P>for months, without telling her of his affection;--that



<P>they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I confess," replied Elinor, "that every circumstance



<P>except ONE is in favour of their engagement;



<P>but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject,



<P>and with me it almost outweighs every other."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How strange this is!&nbsp; You must think

wretchedly indeed



<P>of Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them,



<P>you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together.



<P>Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister



<P>all this time?&nbsp; Do you suppose him really indifferent to her?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I cannot think that.&nbsp; He must and

does love her



<P>I am sure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But with a strange kind of tenderness, if

he can



<P>leave her with such indifference, such carelessness



<P>of the future, as you attribute to him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must remember, my dear mother, that I

have never



<P>considered this matter as certain.&nbsp; I have had my doubts,



<P>I confess; but they are fainter than they were, and they



<P>may soon be entirely done away.&nbsp; If we find they correspond,



<P>every fear of mine will be removed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A mighty concession indeed!&nbsp; If you were

to see



<P>them at the altar, you would suppose they were going to



<P>be married.&nbsp; Ungracious girl!&nbsp; But I require no such proof.



<P>Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt;



<P>no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open



<P>and unreserved.&nbsp; You cannot doubt your sister's wishes.



<P>It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.&nbsp; But why?



<P>Is he not a man of honour and feeling? Has there been any



<P>inconsistency on his side to create alarm? can he be deceitful?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope not, I believe not," cried Elinor.



<P>"I love Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his



<P>integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me.



<P>It has been involuntary, and I will not encourage it.



<P>I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his



<P>manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself,



<P>and did not return your kindness with any cordiality.



<P>But all this may be explained by such a situation of his



<P>affairs as you have supposed.&nbsp; He had just parted from



<P>my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction;



<P>and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith,



<P>to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet



<P>aware that by declining your invitation, by saying



<P>that he was going away for some time, he should seem



<P>to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by our family,



<P>be might well be embarrassed and disturbed.&nbsp; In such a case,



<P>a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been



<P>more to his honour I think, as well as more consistent



<P>with his general character;--but I will not raise objections



<P>against any one's conduct on so illiberal a foundation,



<P>as a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from



<P>what I may think right and consistent."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You speak very properly.&nbsp; Willoughby

certainly does



<P>not deserve to be suspected.&nbsp; Though WE have not known



<P>him long, he is no stranger in this part of the world;



<P>and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?&nbsp; Had he been



<P>in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,



<P>it might have been odd that he should leave us without



<P>acknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case.



<P>It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun,



<P>for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance;



<P>and even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, may now



<P>be very advisable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret;



<P>and Elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations



<P>of her mother, to acknowledge the probability of many,



<P>and hope for the justice of all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time,



<P>when she entered the room and took her place at the table



<P>without saying a word.&nbsp; Her eyes were red and swollen;



<P>and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained



<P>with difficulty.&nbsp; She avoided the looks of them all,



<P>could neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her



<P>mother's silently pressing her hand with tender compassion,



<P>her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome, she burst



<P>into tears and left the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This violent oppression of spirits continued

the



<P>whole evening.&nbsp; She was without any power, because she



<P>was without any desire of command over herself.



<P>The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby



<P>overpowered her in an instant; and though her family



<P>were most anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was



<P>impossible for them, if they spoke at all, to keep clear



<P>of every subject which her feelings connected with him.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's

visit



<P>at the park, with his steadiness in concealing its cause,



<P>filled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings



<P>for two or three days; she was a great wonderer, as every



<P>one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the



<P>comings and goings of all their acquaintance.&nbsp; She wondered,



<P>with little intermission what could be the reason of it;



<P>was sure there must be some bad news, and thought over



<P>every kind of distress that could have befallen him,



<P>with a fixed determination that he should not escape



<P>them all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Something very melancholy must be the matter,



<P>I am sure," said she.&nbsp; "I could see it in his face.



<P>Poor man!&nbsp; I am afraid his circumstances may be bad.



<P>The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand



<P>a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.



<P>I do think he must have been sent for about money matters,



<P>for what else can it be?&nbsp; I wonder whether it is so.



<P>I would give anything to know the truth of it.&nbsp; Perhaps it



<P>is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is,



<P>because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.



<P>May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely,



<P>for I have a notion she is always rather sickly.



<P>I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams.



<P>It is not so very likely he should be distressed in



<P>his circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man,



<P>and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time.



<P>I wonder what it can be!&nbsp; May be his sister is worse



<P>at Avignon, and has sent for him over.&nbsp; His setting off



<P>in such a hurry seems very like it.&nbsp; Well, I wish him out



<P>of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into



<P>the bargain."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.&nbsp;

Her opinion



<P>varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming



<P>equally probable as they arose.&nbsp; Elinor, though she felt



<P>really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon,



<P>could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly



<P>away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling;



<P>for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion



<P>justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation,



<P>her wonder was otherwise disposed of.&nbsp; It was engossed



<P>by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby



<P>on the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly



<P>interesting to them all.&nbsp; As this silence continued,



<P>every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible



<P>with the disposition of both.&nbsp; Why they should not openly



<P>acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant



<P>behaviour to each other declared to have taken place,



<P>Elinor could not imagine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could easily conceive that marriage might

not



<P>be immediately in their power; for though Willoughby



<P>was independent, there was no reason to believe him rich.



<P>His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven



<P>hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that income



<P>could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained



<P>of his poverty.&nbsp; But for this strange kind of secrecy



<P>maintained by them relative to their engagement, which



<P>in fact concealed nothing at all, she could not account;



<P>and it was so wholly contradictory to their general



<P>opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered



<P>her mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt



<P>was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing could be more expressive of attachment



<P>to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour.&nbsp; To Marianne



<P>it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's



<P>heart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the



<P>affectionate attention of a son and a brother.&nbsp; The cottage



<P>seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home;



<P>many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham;



<P>and if no general engagement collected them at the park,



<P>the exercise which called him out in the morning was



<P>almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day



<P>was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his



<P>favourite pointer at her feet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening in particular, about a week after



<P>Colonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed



<P>more than usually open to every feeling of attachment



<P>to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's



<P>happening to mention her design of improving the cottage



<P>in the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration



<P>of a place which affection had established as perfect with him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What!" he exclaimed--"Improve this dear cottage!



<P>No. THAT I will never consent to.&nbsp; Not a stone must



<P>be added to its walls, not an inch to its size,



<P>if my feelings are regarded."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not be alarmed," said Miss Dashwood,



<P>"nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother



<P>will never have money enough to attempt it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am heartily glad of it", he cried.&nbsp;

"May she



<P>always be poor, if she can employ her riches no better."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Willoughby.&nbsp; But you may be

assured that I



<P>would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment



<P>of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements



<P>in the world.&nbsp; Depend upon it that whatever unemployed



<P>sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in the spring,



<P>I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose



<P>of it in a manner so painful to you.&nbsp; But are you really



<P>so attached to this place as to see no defect in it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am," said he.&nbsp; "To me it is faultless.&nbsp;

Nay, more,



<P>I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness



<P>is attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull



<P>Combe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that

smokes,



<P>I suppose," said Elinor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," cried he in the same eager tone, "with

all



<P>and every thing belonging to it;--in no one convenience



<P>or INconvenience about it, should the least variation



<P>be perceptible.&nbsp; Then, and then only, under such a roof, I



<P>might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I flatter myself," replied Elinor, "that even

under



<P>the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase,



<P>you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you



<P>now do this."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There certainly are circumstances," said Willoughby,



<P>"which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will



<P>always have one claim of my affection, which no other can



<P>possibly share."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne,



<P>whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby,



<P>as plainly denoted how well she understood him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How often did I wish," added he, "when I was

at



<P>Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were



<P>inhabited!&nbsp; I never passed within view of it without admiring



<P>its situation, and grieving that no one should live in it.



<P>How little did I then think that the very first news



<P>I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into



<P>the country, would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I



<P>felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event,



<P>which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I



<P>should experience from it, can account for.&nbsp; Must it not have



<P>been so, Marianne?" speaking to her in a lowered voice.



<P>Then continuing his former tone, he said, "And yet this



<P>house you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?&nbsp; You would rob it



<P>of its simplicity by imaginary improvement! and this dear



<P>parlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which



<P>so many happy hours have been since spent by us together,



<P>you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,



<P>and every body would be eager to pass through the room



<P>which has hitherto contained within itself more real



<P>accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of



<P>the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration



<P>of the kind should be attempted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a good woman," he warmly replied.



<P>"Your promise makes me easy.&nbsp; Extend it a little farther,



<P>and it will make me happy.&nbsp; Tell me that not only your



<P>house will remain the same, but that I shall ever find



<P>you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you



<P>will always consider me with the kindness which has made



<P>everything belonging to you so dear to me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's



<P>behaviour during the whole of the evening declared



<P>at once his affection and happiness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?" said

Mrs. Dashwood,



<P>when he was leaving them.&nbsp; "I do not ask you to come in



<P>the morning, for we must walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He engaged to be with them by four o'clock.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing occurred during the next three or four

days,



<P>to make Elinor regret what she had done, in applying



<P>to her mother; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote.



<P>They were engaged about the end of that time to attend



<P>Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was



<P>kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter;



<P>and for this party, Marianne, wholly dispirited,



<P>careless of her appearance, and seeming equally indifferent



<P>whether she went or staid, prepared, without one look



<P>of hope or one expression of pleasure.&nbsp; She sat by the



<P>drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady



<P>Middleton's arrival, without once stirring from her seat,



<P>or altering her attitude, lost in her own thoughts,



<P>and insensible of her sister's presence; and when at



<P>last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them



<P>at the door, she started as if she had forgotten that



<P>any one was expected.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrived in due time at the place of destination,



<P>and as soon as the string of carriages before them



<P>would allow, alighted, ascended the stairs, heard their



<P>names announced from one landing-place to another in an



<P>audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up,



<P>quite full of company, and insufferably hot.&nbsp; When they had



<P>paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady



<P>of the house, they were permitted to mingle in the crowd,



<P>and take their share of the heat and inconvenience, to



<P>which their arrival must necessarily add.&nbsp; After some time



<P>spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat



<P>down to Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for



<P>moving about, she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs,



<P>placed themselves at no great distance from the table.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had not remained in this manner long,

before Elinor



<P>perceived Willoughby, standing within a few yards



<P>of them, in earnest conversation with a very fashionable



<P>looking young woman.&nbsp; She soon caught his eye, and he



<P>immediately bowed, but without attempting to speak to her,



<P>or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her;



<P>and then continued his discourse with the same lady.



<P>Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether



<P>it could be unobserved by her.&nbsp; At that moment she first



<P>perceived him, and her whole countenance glowing with



<P>sudden delight, she would have moved towards him instantly,



<P>had not her sister caught hold of her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good heavens!" she exclaimed, "he is there--he



<P>is there--Oh! why does he not look at me? why cannot



<P>I speak to him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pray, pray be composed," cried Elinor, "and

do



<P>not betray what you feel to every body present.



<P>Perhaps he has not observed you yet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This however was more than she could believe

herself;



<P>and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond



<P>the reach of Marianne, it was beyond her wish.&nbsp; She sat



<P>in an agony of impatience which affected every feature.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last he turned round again, and regarded

them both;



<P>she started up, and pronouncing his name in a tone



<P>of affection, held out her hand to him.&nbsp; He approached,



<P>and addressing himself rather to Elinor than Marianne,



<P>as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to



<P>observe her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after



<P>Mrs. Dashwood, and asked how long they had been in town.



<P>Elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address,



<P>and was unable to say a word.&nbsp; But the feelings of her sister



<P>were instantly expressed.&nbsp; Her face was crimsoned over,



<P>and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,



<P>"Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?



<P>Have you not received my letters?&nbsp; Will you not shake



<P>hands with me?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed



<P>painful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment.



<P>During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure.



<P>Elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression



<P>becoming more tranquil.&nbsp; After a moment's pause, he spoke



<P>with calmness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley



<P>Street last Tuesday, and very much regretted that I was



<P>not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings



<P>at home.&nbsp; My card was not lost, I hope."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But have you not received my notes?" cried

Marianne



<P>in the wildest anxiety.&nbsp; "Here is some mistake I am



<P>sure--some dreadful mistake.&nbsp; What can be the meaning



<P>of it?&nbsp; Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell me,



<P>what is the matter?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made no reply; his complexion changed and

all his



<P>embarrassment returned; but as if, on catching the eye



<P>of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking,



<P>he felt the necessity of instant exertion, he recovered



<P>himself again, and after saying, "Yes, I had the pleasure



<P>of receiving the information of your arrival in town,



<P>which you were so good as to send me," turned hastily away



<P>with a slight bow and joined his friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and

unable



<P>to stand, sunk into her chair, and Elinor, expecting every



<P>moment to see her faint, tried to screen her from the



<P>observation of others, while reviving her with lavender water.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to him, Elinor," she cried, as soon as

she



<P>could speak, "and force him to come to me.&nbsp; Tell him



<P>I must see him again--must speak to him instantly.--



<P>I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment's peace till this



<P>is explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.--



<P>Oh go to him this moment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne,



<P>you must wait.&nbsp; This is not the place for explanations.



<P>Wait only till tomorrow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With difficulty however could she prevent her



<P>from following him herself; and to persuade her to check



<P>her agitation, to wait, at least, with the appearance



<P>of composure, till she might speak to him with more privacy



<P>and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued



<P>incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery



<P>of her feelings, by exclamations of wretchedness.



<P>In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the



<P>door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne that he



<P>was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again



<P>that evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm.



<P>She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady



<P>Middleton to take them home, as she was too miserable



<P>to stay a minute longer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber,



<P>on being informed that Marianne was unwell, was too



<P>polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away,



<P>and making over her cards to a friend, they departed



<P>as soon the carriage could be found.&nbsp; Scarcely a word



<P>was spoken during their return to Berkeley Street.



<P>Marianne was in a silent agony, too much oppressed even



<P>for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home,



<P>they could go directly to their own room, where hartshorn



<P>restored her a little to herself.&nbsp; She was soon undressed



<P>and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone,



<P>her sister then left her, and while she waited the return



<P>of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure enough for thinking over



<P>the past.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That some kind of engagement had subsisted



<P>between Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt,



<P>and that Willoughby was weary of it, seemed equally clear;



<P>for however Marianne might still feed her own wishes,



<P>SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake



<P>or misapprehension of any kind.&nbsp; Nothing but a thorough



<P>change of sentiment could account for it.&nbsp; Her indignation



<P>would have been still stronger than it was, had she



<P>not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak



<P>a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented



<P>her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been



<P>sporting with the affections of her sister from the first,



<P>without any design that would bear investigation.



<P>Absence might have weakened his regard, and convenience



<P>might have determined him to overcome it, but that such



<P>a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself



<P>to doubt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy

a meeting



<P>must already have given her, and on those still more



<P>severe which might await her in its probable consequence,



<P>she could not reflect without the deepest concern.



<P>Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she



<P>could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be



<P>divided in future, her mind might be always supported.



<P>But every circumstance that could embitter such an evil



<P>seemed uniting to heighten the misery of Marianne



<P>in a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate



<P>and irreconcilable rupture with him.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable



<P>had she been able to sleep at all the first night



<P>after parting from Willoughby.&nbsp; She would have been



<P>ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning,



<P>had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose



<P>than when she lay down in it.&nbsp; But the feelings which



<P>made such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger



<P>of incurring it.&nbsp; She was awake the whole night, and she



<P>wept the greatest part of it.&nbsp; She got up with a headache,



<P>was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;



<P>giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters,



<P>and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either.



<P>Her sensibility was potent enough!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When breakfast was over she walked out by herself,



<P>and wandered about the village of Allenham, indulging the



<P>recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present



<P>reverse for the chief of the morning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evening passed off in the equal indulgence

of feeling.



<P>She played over every favourite song that she had been used



<P>to play to Willoughby, every air in which their voices



<P>had been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing



<P>on every line of music that he had written out for her,



<P>till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness



<P>could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every



<P>day applied.&nbsp; She spent whole hours at the pianoforte



<P>alternately singing and crying; her voice often totally



<P>suspended by her tears.&nbsp; In books too, as well as in music,



<P>she courted the misery which a contrast between the past



<P>and present was certain of giving.&nbsp; She read nothing



<P>but what they had been used to read together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such violence of affliction indeed could not

be supported



<P>for ever; it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy;



<P>but these employments, to which she daily recurred,



<P>her solitary walks and silent meditations, still produced



<P>occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed

expected



<P>by Marianne.&nbsp; Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again



<P>became uneasy.&nbsp; But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations



<P>whenever she wanted them, which at least satisfied herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember, Elinor," said she, "how very often

Sir John



<P>fetches our letters himself from the post, and carries them



<P>to it.&nbsp; We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary,



<P>and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if



<P>their correspondence were to pass through Sir John's hands."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and

she tried



<P>to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence.



<P>But there was one method so direct, so simple, and in



<P>her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state



<P>of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery,



<P>that she could not help suggesting it to her mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you not ask Marianne at once," said

she,



<P>"whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby?&nbsp; From you,



<P>her mother, and so kind, so indulgent a mother, the question



<P>could not give offence.&nbsp; It would be the natural result



<P>of your affection for her.&nbsp; She used to be all unreserve,



<P>and to you more especially."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would not ask such a question for the world.



<P>Supposing it possible that they are not engaged,



<P>what distress would not such an enquiry inflict!&nbsp; At any



<P>rate it would be most ungenerous.&nbsp; I should never deserve



<P>her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession



<P>of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.



<P>I know Marianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me,



<P>and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known,



<P>when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible.



<P>I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one;



<P>of a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent



<P>the denial which her wishes might direct."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor thought this generosity overstrained,



<P>considering her sister's youth, and urged the matter farther,



<P>but in vain; common sense, common care, common prudence,



<P>were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic delicacy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was several days before Willoughby's name



<P>was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family;



<P>Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were not so nice;



<P>their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--



<P>but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a



<P>volume of Shakespeare, exclaimed,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our

dear



<P>Willoughby went away before we could get through it.



<P>We will put it by, that when he comes again...But it may



<P>be months, perhaps, before THAT happens."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Months!" cried Marianne, with strong surprise.



<P>"No--nor many weeks."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said;



<P>but it gave Elinor pleasure, as it produced a reply



<P>from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby



<P>and knowledge of his intentions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning, about a week after his leaving

the country,



<P>Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their



<P>usual walk, instead of wandering away by herself.



<P>Hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in



<P>her rambles.&nbsp; If her sisters intended to walk on the downs,



<P>she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked



<P>of the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills,



<P>and could never be found when the others set off.



<P>But at length she was secured by the exertions of Elinor,



<P>who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.&nbsp; They walked



<P>along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,



<P>for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor,



<P>satisfied with gaining one point, would not then attempt more.



<P>Beyond the entrance of the valley, where the country,



<P>though still rich, was less wild and more open, a long



<P>stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming



<P>to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point,



<P>they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect



<P>which formed the distance of their view from the cottage,



<P>from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any



<P>of their walks before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon

discovered



<P>an animated one; it was a man on horseback riding towards them.



<P>In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman;



<P>and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!"--and

was



<P>hastening to meet him, when Elinor cried out,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.&nbsp;

It is



<P>not Willoughby.&nbsp; The person is not tall enough for him,



<P>and has not his air."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He has, he has," cried Marianne, "I am sure

he has.



<P>His air, his coat, his horse.&nbsp; I knew how soon he would come."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor,



<P>to screen Marianne from particularity, as she felt almost



<P>certain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her



<P>pace and kept up with her.&nbsp; They were soon within



<P>thirty yards of the gentleman.&nbsp; Marianne looked again;



<P>her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round,



<P>she was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters



<P>were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well known



<P>as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her to stop,



<P>and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome



<P>Edward Ferrars.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was the only person in the world who could



<P>at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby;



<P>the only one who could have gained a smile from her;



<P>but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her



<P>sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dismounted, and giving his horse to his

servant,



<P>walked back with them to Barton, whither he was purposely



<P>coming to visit them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality,



<P>but especially by Marianne, who showed more warmth of



<P>regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself.



<P>To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward and her sister



<P>was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she



<P>had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.



<P>On Edward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency



<P>of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.



<P>He was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure



<P>in seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay,



<P>said little but what was forced from him by questions,



<P>and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.



<P>Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise.



<P>She began almost to feel a dislike of Edward; and it ended,



<P>as every feeling must end with her, by carrying back her



<P>thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a contrast



<P>sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short silence which succeeded the first



<P>surprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked



<P>Edward if he came directly from London.&nbsp; No, he had



<P>been in Devonshire a fortnight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A fortnight!" she repeated, surprised at his

being



<P>so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing



<P>her before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked rather distressed as he added, that

he



<P>had been staying with some friends near Plymouth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you been lately in Sussex?" said Elinor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was at Norland about a month ago."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And how does dear, dear Norland look?" cried

Marianne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear, dear Norland," said Elinor, "probably

looks



<P>much as it always does at this time of the year.



<P>The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh," cried Marianne, "with what transporting

sensation



<P>have I formerly seen them fall!&nbsp; How have I delighted,



<P>as I walked, to see them driven in showers about me



<P>by the wind!&nbsp; What feelings have they, the season, the air



<P>altogether inspired!&nbsp; Now there is no one to regard them.



<P>They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off,



<P>and driven as much as possible from the sight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not every one," said Elinor, "who has

your



<P>passion for dead leaves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No; my feelings are not often shared, not

often



<P>understood.&nbsp; But SOMETIMES they are."--As she said this,



<P>she sunk into a reverie for a few moments;--but rousing



<P>herself again, "Now, Edward," said she, calling his attention



<P>to the prospect, "here is Barton valley.&nbsp; Look up to it,



<P>and be tranquil if you can.&nbsp; Look at those hills!



<P>Did you ever see their equals?&nbsp; To the left is Barton park,



<P>amongst those woods and plantations.&nbsp; You may see the end



<P>of the house.&nbsp; And there, beneath that farthest hill,



<P>which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is a beautiful country," he replied; "but

these



<P>bottoms must be dirty in winter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can you think of dirt, with such objects

before you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because," replied he, smiling, "among the

rest of the



<P>objects before me, I see a very dirty lane."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How strange!" said Marianne to herself as

she walked on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?&nbsp;

Are the



<P>Middletons pleasant people?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not all," answered Marianne; "we could

not



<P>be more unfortunately situated."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marianne," cried her sister, "how can you

say so? How can



<P>you be so unjust?&nbsp; They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars;



<P>and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner.&nbsp; Have you



<P>forgot, Marianne, how many pleasant days we have owed to them?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," said Marianne, in a low voice, "nor how

many



<P>painful moments."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor took no notice of this; and directing



<P>her attention to their visitor, endeavoured to support



<P>something like discourse with him, by talking of their



<P>present residence, its conveniences, &amp;c. extorting from him



<P>occasional questions and remarks.&nbsp; His coldness and reserve



<P>mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry;



<P>but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past



<P>rather than the present, she avoided every appearance



<P>of resentment or displeasure, and treated him as she



<P>thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress



<P>of Norland; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded



<P>to the condition of visitors.&nbsp; As such, however, they were



<P>treated by her with quiet civility; and by her husband



<P>with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody



<P>beyond himself, his wife, and their child.&nbsp; He really



<P>pressed them, with some earnestness, to consider Norland



<P>as their home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible



<P>to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could



<P>accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood,



<P>his invitation was accepted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A continuance in a place where everything reminded



<P>her of former delight, was exactly what suited her mind.



<P>In seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful



<P>than hers, or possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine



<P>expectation of happiness which is happiness itself.



<P>But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,



<P>and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was



<P>beyond alloy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of

what her



<P>husband intended to do for his sisters.&nbsp; To take three



<P>thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy



<P>would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree.



<P>She begged him to think again on the subject.&nbsp; How could



<P>he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only



<P>child too, of so large a sum?&nbsp; And what possible claim



<P>could the Miss Dashwoods, who were related to him only by



<P>half blood, which she considered as no relationship at all,



<P>have on his generosity to so large an amount.&nbsp; It was very



<P>well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist



<P>between the children of any man by different marriages;



<P>and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry,



<P>by giving away all his money to his half sisters?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was my father's last request to me," replied



<P>her husband, "that I should assist his widow and daughters."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He did not know what he was talking of, I

dare say;



<P>ten to one but he was light-headed at the time.



<P>Had he been in his right senses, he could not have thought



<P>of such a thing as begging you to give away half your



<P>fortune from your own child."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He did not stipulate for any particular sum,



<P>my dear Fanny; he only requested me, in general terms,



<P>to assist them, and make their situation more comfortable



<P>than it was in his power to do.&nbsp; Perhaps it would



<P>have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.



<P>He could hardly suppose I should neglect them.



<P>But as he required the promise, I could not do less



<P>than give it; at least I thought so at the time.



<P>The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.



<P>Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland



<P>and settle in a new home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then, LET something be done for them;



<P>but THAT something need not be three thousand pounds.



<P>Consider," she added, "that when the money is once



<P>parted with, it never can return.&nbsp; Your sisters will marry,



<P>and it will be gone for ever.&nbsp; If, indeed, it could



<P>be restored to our poor little boy--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, to be sure," said her husband, very gravely,



<P>"that would make great difference.&nbsp; The time may come when



<P>Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with.



<P>If he should have a numerous family, for instance, it would



<P>be a very convenient addition."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be sure it would."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps, then, it would be better for all

parties,



<P>if the sum were diminished one half.--Five hundred pounds



<P>would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! beyond anything great!&nbsp; What brother

on earth



<P>would do half so much for his sisters, even if REALLY



<P>his sisters!&nbsp; And as it is--only half blood!--But you



<P>have such a generous spirit!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would not wish to do any thing mean," he

replied.



<P>"One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than



<P>too little.&nbsp; No one, at least, can think I have not



<P>done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly



<P>expect more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no knowing what THEY may expect,"



<P>said the lady, "but we are not to think of their



<P>expectations: the question is, what you can afford to do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly--and I think I may afford to give

them five



<P>hundred pounds a-piece.&nbsp; As it is, without any addition



<P>of mine, they will each have about three thousand pounds



<P>on their mother's death--a very comfortable fortune



<P>for any young woman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes

me that



<P>they can want no addition at all.&nbsp; They will have ten



<P>thousand pounds divided amongst them.&nbsp; If they marry,



<P>they will be sure of doing well, and if they do not,



<P>they may all live very comfortably together on the interest



<P>of ten thousand pounds."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is very true, and, therefore, I do not

know whether,



<P>upon the whole, it would not be more advisable to do



<P>something for their mother while she lives, rather than



<P>for them--something of the annuity kind I mean.--My sisters



<P>would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.



<P>A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving



<P>her consent to this plan.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be sure," said she, "it is better than

parting with



<P>fifteen hundred pounds at once.&nbsp; But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood



<P>should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot



<P>be worth half that purchase."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly not; but if you observe, people

always



<P>live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them;



<P>and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty.



<P>An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over



<P>and over every year, and there is no getting rid



<P>of it.&nbsp; You are not aware of what you are doing.



<P>I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities;



<P>for my mother was clogged with the payment of three



<P>to old superannuated servants by my father's will,



<P>and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it.



<P>Twice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then



<P>there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one



<P>of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned



<P>out to be no such thing.&nbsp; My mother was quite sick of it.



<P>Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual



<P>claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father,



<P>because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at



<P>my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever.



<P>It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am



<P>sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for



<P>all the world."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is certainly an unpleasant thing," replied

Mr. Dashwood,



<P>"to have those kind of yearly drains on one's income.



<P>One's fortune, as your mother justly says, is NOT one's own.



<P>To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum,



<P>on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away



<P>one's independence."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks

for it.



<P>They think themselves secure, you do no more than what



<P>is expected, and it raises no gratitude at all.&nbsp; If I were you,



<P>whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely.



<P>I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly.



<P>It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred,



<P>or even fifty pounds from our own expenses."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe you are right, my love; it will

be better



<P>that there should by no annuity in the case; whatever I



<P>may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance



<P>than a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge



<P>their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income,



<P>and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end



<P>of the year.&nbsp; It will certainly be much the best way.



<P>A present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent



<P>their ever being distressed for money, and will, I think,



<P>be amply discharging my promise to my father."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be sure it will.&nbsp; Indeed, to say the

truth,



<P>I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea



<P>of your giving them any money at all.&nbsp; The assistance



<P>he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be



<P>reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking



<P>out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them



<P>to move their things, and sending them presents of fish



<P>and game, and so forth, whenever they are in season.



<P>I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,



<P>it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.



<P>Do but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively



<P>comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live



<P>on the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the



<P>thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings



<P>them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course,



<P>they will pay their mother for their board out of it.



<P>Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them,



<P>and what on earth can four women want for more than



<P>that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will



<P>be nothing at all.&nbsp; They will have no carriage, no horses,



<P>and hardly any servants; they will keep no company,



<P>and can have no expenses of any kind!&nbsp; Only conceive



<P>how comfortable they will be!&nbsp; Five hundred a year! I am



<P>sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it;



<P>and as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think



<P>of it.&nbsp; They will be much more able to give YOU something."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upon my word," said Mr. Dashwood, "I believe

you



<P>are perfectly right.&nbsp; My father certainly could mean



<P>nothing more by his request to me than what you say.



<P>I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil



<P>my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness



<P>to them as you have described.&nbsp; When my mother removes



<P>into another house my services shall be readily given



<P>to accommodate her as far as I can.&nbsp; Some little present



<P>of furniture too may be acceptable then."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Certainly," returned Mrs. John Dashwood.&nbsp;

"But, however,



<P>ONE thing must be considered.&nbsp; When your father and mother



<P>moved to Norland, though the furniture of Stanhill



<P>was sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved,



<P>and is now left to your mother.&nbsp; Her house will therefore



<P>be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a material consideration undoubtedly.



<P>A valuable legacy indeed! And yet some of the plate would



<P>have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice



<P>as handsome as what belongs to this house.&nbsp; A great



<P>deal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place THEY



<P>can ever afford to live in.&nbsp; But, however, so it is.



<P>Your father thought only of THEM.&nbsp; And I must say this:



<P>that you owe no particular gratitude to him, nor attention



<P>to his wishes; for we very well know that if he could,



<P>he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This argument was irresistible.&nbsp; It gave

to his



<P>intentions whatever of decision was wanting before; and he



<P>finally resolved, that it would be absolutely unnecessary,



<P>if not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow



<P>and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly



<P>acts as his own wife pointed out.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months;



<P>not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every



<P>well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it



<P>produced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive,



<P>and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that



<P>of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances,



<P>she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries



<P>for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland;



<P>for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.



<P>But she could hear of no situation that at once answered



<P>her notions of comfort and ease, and suited the prudence



<P>of her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment rejected



<P>several houses as too large for their income, which her



<P>mother would have approved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband

of the



<P>solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour,



<P>which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections.



<P>She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he



<P>had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her daughters'



<P>sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was



<P>persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would



<P>support her in affluence.&nbsp; For their brother's sake, too,



<P>for the sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she



<P>reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before,



<P>in believing him incapable of generosity.&nbsp; His attentive



<P>behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that



<P>their welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time,



<P>she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contempt which she had, very early in their

acquaintance,



<P>felt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increased



<P>by the farther knowledge of her character, which half



<P>a year's residence in her family afforded; and perhaps



<P>in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal



<P>affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might



<P>have found it impossible to have lived together so long,



<P>had not a particular circumstance occurred to give



<P>still greater eligibility, according to the opinions



<P>of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters' continuance at Norland.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This circumstance was a growing attachment

between



<P>her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood,



<P>a gentleman-like and pleasing young man, who was introduced



<P>to their acquaintance soon after his sister's establishment



<P>at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part



<P>of his time there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy

from



<P>motives of interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son



<P>of a man who had died very rich; and some might have repressed



<P>it from motives of prudence, for, except a trifling sum,



<P>the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother.



<P>But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration.



<P>It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,



<P>that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned



<P>the partiality.&nbsp; It was contrary to every doctrine of



<P>her's that difference of fortune should keep any couple



<P>asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition;



<P>and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged



<P>by every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their

good



<P>opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address.



<P>He was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy



<P>to make them pleasing.&nbsp; He was too diffident to do justice



<P>to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,



<P>his behaviour gave every indication of an open,



<P>affectionate heart.&nbsp; His understanding was good,



<P>and his education had given it solid improvement.



<P>But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition



<P>to answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed



<P>to see him distinguished--as--they hardly knew what.



<P>They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some



<P>manner or other.&nbsp; His mother wished to interest him in



<P>political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to see



<P>him connected with some of the great men of the day.



<P>Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while,



<P>till one of these superior blessings could be attained, it would



<P>have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche.



<P>But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches.



<P>All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet



<P>of private life.&nbsp; Fortunately he had a younger brother



<P>who was more promising.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward had been staying several weeks in the

house



<P>before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention;



<P>for she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered



<P>her careless of surrounding objects.&nbsp; She saw only that he



<P>was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.



<P>He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by



<P>ill-timed conversation.&nbsp; She was first called to observe



<P>and approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor



<P>chanced one day to make on the difference between him



<P>and his sister.&nbsp; It was a contrast which recommended him



<P>most forcibly to her mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is enough," said she; "to say that he is

unlike



<P>Fanny is enough.&nbsp; It implies everything amiable.



<P>I love him already."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you will like him," said Elinor, "when

you



<P>know more of him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like him!" replied her mother with a smile.



<P>"I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may esteem him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have never yet known what it was to separate



<P>esteem and love."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted

with him.



<P>Her manners were attaching, and soon banished his reserve.



<P>She speedily comprehended all his merits; the persuasion



<P>of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration;



<P>but she really felt assured of his worth: and even that



<P>quietness of manner, which militated against all her



<P>established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be,



<P>was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be



<P>warm and his temper affectionate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love



<P>in his behaviour to Elinor, than she considered their



<P>serious attachment as certain, and looked forward



<P>to their marriage as rapidly approaching.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a few months, my dear Marianne." said she,



<P>"Elinor will, in all probability be settled for life.



<P>We shall miss her; but SHE will be happy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! Mamma, how shall we do without her?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My love, it will be scarcely a separation.



<P>We shall live within a few miles of each other, and shall



<P>meet every day of our lives.&nbsp; You will gain a brother,



<P>a real, affectionate brother.&nbsp; I have the highest opinion



<P>in the world of Edward's heart.&nbsp; But you look grave,



<P>Marianne; do you disapprove your sister's choice?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps," said Marianne, "I may consider it



<P>with some surprise.&nbsp; Edward is very amiable, and I love



<P>him tenderly.&nbsp; But yet--he is not the kind of young



<P>man--there is something wanting--his figure is not striking;



<P>it has none of that grace which I should expect



<P>in the man who could seriously attach my sister.



<P>His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once



<P>announce virtue and intelligence.&nbsp; And besides all this,



<P>I am afraid, Mamma, he has no real taste.&nbsp; Music seems



<P>scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor's



<P>drawings very much, it is not the admiration of a person



<P>who can understand their worth.&nbsp; It is evident, in spite of



<P>his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact



<P>he knows nothing of the matter.&nbsp; He admires as a lover,



<P>not as a connoisseur.&nbsp; To satisfy me, those characters



<P>must be united.&nbsp; I could not be happy with a man whose



<P>taste did not in every point coincide with my own.



<P>He must enter into all my feelings; the same books,



<P>the same music must charm us both.&nbsp; Oh! mama, how spiritless,



<P>how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!



<P>I felt for my sister most severely.&nbsp; Yet she bore it



<P>with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.



<P>I could hardly keep my seat.&nbsp; To hear those beautiful lines



<P>which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced



<P>with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He would certainly have done more justice

to



<P>simple and elegant prose.&nbsp; I thought so at the time;



<P>but you WOULD give him Cowper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nay, Mamma, if he is not to be animated by

Cowper!--



<P>but we must allow for difference of taste.&nbsp; Elinor has



<P>not my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and



<P>be happy with him.&nbsp; But it would have broke MY heart,



<P>had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.



<P>Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced



<P>that I shall never see a man whom I can really love.



<P>I require so much!&nbsp; He must have all Edward's virtues,



<P>and his person and manners must ornament his goodness



<P>with every possible charm."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.



<P>It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness.



<P>Why should you be less fortunate than your mother?&nbsp; In



<P>one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your destiny be



<P>different from her's!"

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment

at



<P>seeing him; for his coming to Barton was, in her opinion,



<P>of all things the most natural.&nbsp; Her joy and expression



<P>of regard long outlived her wonder.&nbsp; He received the kindest



<P>welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not



<P>stand against such a reception.&nbsp; They had begun to fail him



<P>before he entered the house, and they were quite overcome



<P>by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood.&nbsp; Indeed a man



<P>could not very well be in love with either of her daughters,



<P>without extending the passion to her; and Elinor had the



<P>satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself.



<P>His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all,



<P>and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible.



<P>He was not in spirits, however; he praised their house,



<P>admired its prospect, was attentive, and kind; but still



<P>he was not in spirits.&nbsp; The whole family perceived it,



<P>and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality



<P>in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all



<P>selfish parents.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are Mrs. Ferrars's views for you at present,

Edward?"



<P>said she, when dinner was over and they had drawn round



<P>the fire; "are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. I hope my mother is now convinced that

I have



<P>no more talents than inclination for a public life!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But how is your fame to be established? for

famous you



<P>must be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination



<P>for expense, no affection for strangers, no profession,



<P>and no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I shall not attempt it.&nbsp; I have no wish

to be



<P>distinguished; and have every reason to hope I never shall.



<P>Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have no ambition, I well know.&nbsp; Your

wishes



<P>are all moderate."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As moderate as those of the rest of the world,



<P>I believe.&nbsp; I wish as well as every body else to be



<P>perfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be



<P>in my own way.&nbsp; Greatness will not make me so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strange that it would!" cried Marianne.&nbsp;

"What have



<P>wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grandeur has but little," said Elinor, "but

wealth



<P>has much to do with it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Elinor, for shame!" said Marianne, "money

can only



<P>give happiness where there is nothing else to give it.



<P>Beyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction,



<P>as far as mere self is concerned."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps," said Elinor, smiling, "we may come



<P>to the same point.&nbsp; YOUR competence and MY wealth



<P>are very much alike, I dare say; and without them,



<P>as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every



<P>kind of external comfort must be wanting.&nbsp; Your ideas



<P>are only more noble than mine.&nbsp; Come, what is your competence?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year;



<P>not more than THAT."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor laughed.&nbsp; "TWO thousand a year!

ONE is my



<P>wealth! I guessed how it would end."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate

income,"



<P>said Marianne.&nbsp; "A family cannot well be maintained on



<P>a smaller.&nbsp; I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands.



<P>A proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two,



<P>and hunters, cannot be supported on less."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing



<P>so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hunters!" repeated Edward--"but why must you

have



<P>hunters?&nbsp; Every body does not hunt."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne coloured as she replied, "But most

people do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish," said Margaret, striking out a novel

thought,



<P>"that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh that they would!" cried Marianne, her eyes



<P>sparkling with animation, and her cheeks glowing



<P>with the delight of such imaginary happiness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,"



<P>said Elinor, "in spite of the insufficiency of wealth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh dear!" cried Margaret, "how happy I should

be!



<P>I wonder what I should do with it!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that

point.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune

myself,"



<P>said Mrs. Dashwood, "if my children were all to be rich



<P>my help."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must begin your improvements on this house,"



<P>observed Elinor, "and your difficulties will soon vanish."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What magnificent orders would travel from

this family



<P>to London," said Edward, "in such an event!&nbsp; What a happy



<P>day for booksellers, music-sellers, and print-shops!&nbsp; You,



<P>Miss Dashwood, would give a general commission for every



<P>new print of merit to be sent you--and as for Marianne,



<P>I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough



<P>in London to content her.&nbsp; And books!--Thomson, Cowper,



<P>Scott--she would buy them all over and over again: she



<P>would buy up every copy, I believe, to prevent their



<P>falling into unworthy hands; and she would have every



<P>book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree.



<P>Should not you, Marianne?&nbsp; Forgive me, if I am very saucy.



<P>But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our



<P>old disputes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether

it



<P>be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it--and you



<P>will never offend me by talking of former times.



<P>You are very right in supposing how my money would be



<P>spent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly



<P>be employed in improving my collection of music and books."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And the bulk of your fortune would be laid

out



<P>in annuities on the authors or their heirs."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Edward, I should have something else to

do



<P>with it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward

on that



<P>person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim,



<P>that no one can ever be in love more than once in their



<P>life--your opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are

tolerably fixed.



<P>It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,"

said Elinor,



<P>"she is not at all altered."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is only grown a little more grave than

she was."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nay, Edward," said Marianne, "you need not

reproach me.



<P>You are not very gay yourself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why should you think so!" replied he, with

a sigh.



<P>"But gaiety never was a part of MY character."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's," said

Elinor;



<P>"I should hardly call her a lively girl--she is very earnest,



<P>very eager in all she does--sometimes talks a great deal



<P>and always with animation--but she is not often really merry."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe you are right," he replied, "and

yet I



<P>have always set her down as a lively girl."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have frequently detected myself in such

kind of mistakes,"



<P>said Elinor, "in a total misapprehension of character in some



<P>point or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave,



<P>or ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can



<P>hardly tell why or in what the deception originated.



<P>Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves,



<P>and very frequently by what other people say of them,



<P>without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I thought it was right, Elinor," said

Marianne,



<P>"to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people.



<P>I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient



<P>to those of neighbours.&nbsp; This has always been your doctrine,



<P>I am sure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Marianne, never.&nbsp; My doctrine has

never aimed



<P>at the subjection of the understanding.&nbsp; All I have



<P>ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour.



<P>You must not confound my meaning.&nbsp; I am guilty, I confess,



<P>of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance



<P>in general with greater attention; but when have I advised



<P>you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their



<P>judgment in serious matters?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have not been able to bring your sister

over to your



<P>plan of general civility," said Edward to Elinor, "Do you gain



<P>no ground?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quite the contrary," replied Elinor,



<P>looking expressively at Marianne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My judgment," he returned, "is all on your

side



<P>of the question; but I am afraid my practice is much



<P>more on your sister's.&nbsp; I never wish to offend, but I



<P>am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent,



<P>when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.



<P>I have frequently thought that I must have been intended



<P>by nature to be fond of low company, I am so little at



<P>my ease among strangers of gentility!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention



<P>of hers," said Elinor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She knows her own worth too well for false

shame,"



<P>replied Edward.&nbsp; "Shyness is only the effect of a sense



<P>of inferiority in some way or other.&nbsp; If I could persuade



<P>myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful,



<P>I should not be shy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you would still be reserved," said Marianne,



<P>"and that is worse."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward started--"Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, very."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not understand you," replied he, colouring.



<P>"Reserved!--how, in what manner?&nbsp; What am I to tell you?



<P>What can you suppose?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but

trying



<P>to laugh off the subject, she said to him, "Do not you



<P>know my sister well enough to understand what she means?



<P>Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not



<P>talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously



<P>as herself?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward made no answer.&nbsp; His gravity and

thoughtfulness



<P>returned on him in their fullest extent--and he sat



<P>for some time silent and dull.
