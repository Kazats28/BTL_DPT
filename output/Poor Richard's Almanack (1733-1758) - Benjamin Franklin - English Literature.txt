        _Poor Richard Improved_


        1750





        To the READER.





        The Hope of acquiring lasting FAME, is, with many Authors, a


most powerful Motive to Writing.  Some, tho' few, have succeeded; and


others, tho' perhaps fewer, may succeed hereafter, and be as well


known to Posterity by their Works, as the Antients are to us.  We


_Philomaths_, as ambitious of Fame as any other Writers whatever,


after all our painful Watchings and laborious Calculations, have the


constant Mortification to see our Works thrown by at the End of the


Year, and treated as mere waste Paper.  Our only Consolation is, that


short-lived as they are, they out-live those of most of our


Cotemporaries.





        Yet, condemned to renew the _Sisyphean_ Toil, we every Year


heave another heavy Mass up the Muses Hill, which never can the


Summit reach, and soon comes tumbling down again.





        This, kind Reader, is my seventeenth Labour of the Kind.  Thro'


thy continued Good-will, they have procur'd me, if no _Bays_, at


least _Pence_; and the latter is perhaps the better of the two; since


'tis not improbable that a Man may receive more solid Satisfaction


from _Pudding_, while he is _living_, than from _Praise_, after he is


_dead._





        In my last, a few Faults escap'd; some belong to the Author,


but most to the Printer: Let each take his Share of the Blame,


confess, and amend for the future.  In the second Page of _August_, I


mention'd 120 as the next perfect Number to 28; it was wrong, 120


being no perfect Number; the next to 28 I find to be 496.  The first


is 6; let the curious Reader, fond of mathematical Questions, find


the fourth.  In the 2d Page of _March_, in some Copies, the Earth's


Circumference was said to be nigh 4000, instead of 24000 Miles, the


Figure 2 being omitted at the Beginning.  This was Mr. Printer's


Fault; who being also somewhat niggardly of his Vowels, as well as


profuse of his Consonants, put in one Place, among the Poetry, _mad_,


instead of _made_, and in another _wrapp'd_, instead of _warp'd_; to


the utter demolishing of all Sense in those Lines, leaving nothing


standing but the Rhime.  These, and some others, of the like kind,


let the Readers forgive, or rebuke him for, as to their Wisdom and


Goodness shall seem meet: For in such Cases the Loss and Damage is


chiefly to the Reader, who, if he does not take my Sense at first


Reading, 'tis odds he never gets it; for ten to one he does not read


my Works a second Time.





        Printers indeed should be very careful how they omit a Figure


or a Letter: For by such Means sometimes a terrible Alteration is


made in the Sense.  I have heard, that once, in a new Edition of the


_Common Prayer_, the following Sentence, _We shall all be changed in


a Moment, in the Twinkling of an Eye_; by the Omission of a single


Letter, became, _We shall all be hanged in a Moment,_ &c. to the no


small Surprize of the first Congregation it was read to.





        May this Year prove a happy One to Thee and Thine, is the


hearty Wish of, Kind Reader,


                                   _Thy obliged Friend,_

        _Poor Richard Improved_


        1751





        COURTEOUS READER,


        Astrology is one of the most ancient Sciences, had in high


Esteem of old, by the Wise and Great.  Formerly, no Prince would make


War or Peace, nor any General fight a Battle, in short, no important


Affair was undertaken without first consulting an _Astrologer_, who


examined the Aspects and Configurations of the heavenly Bodies, and


mark'd the _lucky Hour._ Now the noble Art (more Shame to the Age we


live in!) is dwindled into Contempt; the Great neglect us, Empires


make Leagues, and Parliaments Laws, without advising with us; and


scarce any other Use is made of our learned Labours, than to find the


best Time of cutting Corns, or gelding Pigs. -- This Mischief we owe


in a great Measure to ourselves: The Ignorant Herd of Mankind, had


they not been encourag'd to it by some of us, would never have dared


to depreciate our sacred Dictates; but _Urania_ has been betray'd by


her own Sons; those whom she had favour'd with the greatest Skill in


her divine Art, the most eminent Astronomers among the Moderns, the


_Newtons_, _Halleys_, and _Whistons_, have wantonly contemn'd and


abus'd her, contrary to the Light of their own Consciences.  Of


these, only the last nam'd, _Whiston_, has liv'd to repent, and speak


his Mind honestly.  In his former Works he had treated _Judiciary


Astrology_ as a Chimera, and asserted, That not only the fixed Stars,


but the Planets (Sun and Moon excepted) were at so immense a


Distance, as to be incapable of any Influence on this Earth, and


consequently nothing could be foretold from their Positions: but now


in the Memoirs of his Life, publish'd 1749, in the 82d Year of his


Age, he foretels, Page 607, the sudden Destruction of the _Turkish_


Empire, and of the House of _Austria_, _German_ Emperors, _&c._ and


_Popes_ of _Rome_; the Restoration of the _Jews_, and Commencement of


the _Millennium_; all by the Year 1766; and this not only from


Scripture Prophecies; but (take his own Words) -- "From the


remarkable _astronomical_ Signals that are to alarm Mankind of what


is coming, _viz._ The _Northern Lights_ since 1715; the six Comets at


the Protestant Reformation in four Years, 1530, 1531, 1533, 1534,


compar'd with the seven Comets already seen in these last eleven


Years 1737, 1739, 1742, 1743, 1744, 1746, and 1748. -- From the great


Annular Eclipse of the Sun, _July_ 14, 1748, whose Center pass'd


through all the four Monarchies, from _Scotland_ to the


_East-Indies._ -- From the Occultation of the _Pleiades_ by the Moon


each periodical Month, after the Eclipse last _July_, for above three


Years, visible to the whole _Roman_ Empire; as there was a like


Occultation of the _Hyades_ from _A._ 590, to _A._ 595, for six Years


foretold by _Isaiah._ -- From the Transit of _Mercury_ over the


_Sun_, _April_ 25, 1753, which will be visible thro' that Empire. --


From the Comet of _A. D._ 1456, 1531, 1607, and 1682, which will


appear again about 1757 ending, or 1758 beginning, and will also be


visible thro' that Empire. -- From the Transit of _Venus_ over the


_Sun_, _May_ 26, 1761, which will be visible over the same Empire:


And lastly, from the annular Eclipse of the _Sun_, _March_ 11, 1764,


which will be visible over the same Empire." -- From these


_Astronomical Signs_, he foretels those great Events, That within 16


Years from this Time, "the _Millennium_ or 1000 Years Reign of Christ


shall begin, there shall be a _new Heavens_, and a _new Earth_; there


shall be no more an Infidel in _Christendom_, Page 398, nor a


Gaming-Table at _Tunbridge_!" -- When these Predictions are


accomplished, what glorious Proofs they will be of the Truth of our


Art? -- And if they happen to fail, there is no doubt but so profound


an Astronomer as Mr. _Whiston_, will be able to see _other_ Signs in


the Heavens, foreshowing that the Conversion of Infidels was to be


postponed, and the _Millennium_ adjourn'd. -- After these great


Things can any Man doubt our being capable of predicting a little


Rain or Sun-shine? -- Reader, Farewell, and make the best Use of your


Years and your Almanacks, for you see, that according to _Whiston_,


you may have at most, but sixteen more of them.

                                 ______





        The _Romans_ were 477 Years, without so much as a Sun-dial to


show the Time of Day: The first they had was brought from _Sicily_,


by _Valerius Messala_: One hundred and eighteen Years afterwards,


_Scipio Nasica_, produced to them an Invention for measuring the


Hours in cloudy Weather, it was by the Dropping of Water out of one


Vessel into another, somewhat like our Sand-Glasses.  Clocks and


Watches, to shew the Hour, are very modern Inventions.  The


Sub-dividing Hours into Minutes, and Minutes into Seconds, by those


curious Machines, is not older than the Days of our Fathers, but now


brought to a surprising Nicety.





        Since our Time is reduced to a Standard, and the Bullion of the


Day minted out into Hours, the Industrious know how to employ every


Piece of Time to a real Advantage in their different Professions: And


he that is prodigal of his Hours, is, in Effect, a Squanderer of


Money.  I remember a notable Woman, who was fully sensible of the


intrinsic Value of _Time._ Her Husband was a Shoemaker, and an


excellent Craftsman, but never minded how the Minutes passed.  In


vain did she inculcate to him, That _Time is Money._ He had too much


Wit to apprehend her, and it prov'd his Ruin.  When at the Alehouse


among his idle Companions, if one remark'd that the Clock struck


Eleven, _What is that,_ says he, _among us all?_ If she sent him Word


by the Boy, that it had struck Twelve; _Tell her to be easy, it can


never be more._ If, that it had struck One, _Bid her be comforted,


for it can never be less._





        If we lose our Money, it gives us some Concern.  If we are


cheated or robb'd of it, we are angry: But Money lost may be found;


what we are robb'd of may be restored: The Treasure of Time once


lost, can never be recovered; yet we squander it as tho' 'twere


nothing worth, or we had no Use for it.





        The Bell strikes _One_: We take no Note of Time,


        But from its Loss.  To give it then a Tongue


        Is wise in Man.  If heard aright


        It is the Knell of our departed Hours;


        Where are they?  With the Years beyond the Flood:


        It is the Signal that demands Dispatch;


        How much is to be done? ------


        Be wise To-day, 'tis Madness to defer;


        Next day the fatal Precedent will plead;


        Thus on, till Wisdom is push'd out of Life:


        _Procrastination_ is the Thief of Time,


        Year after Year it steals till all are fled,


        And to the Mercies of a Moment leaves


        The vast Concerns of an eternal Scene.


        If not so frequent, would not this be strange?


        That 'tis so frequent, _This_ is stranger still.

        That admirable Instrument the MICROSCOPE has opened to us of


these latter Ages, a World utterly unknown to the Ancients.  There


are very few Substances, in which it does not shew something curious


and unexpected; but for the Sake of such Readers as are unacquainted


with that Instrument, I shall set down some of the most remarkably


entertaining Objects, upon which actual Observations have been made.





        1. The Globules of the Blood, which are computed to be almost a


two thousandth Part of an Inch in Diameter, each consisting of six


small Globules, each of which again probably consists of six smaller,


and so on.  The Circulation of the Blood is to be seen very


distinctly in the Tail of a small Fish, the Web of the Foot of a


Frog, _&c._ and the Globules to split and divide, before they can


enter the smallest Vessels.





        2. The Bones of all Creatures, sliced extremely thin, afford an


entertaining Object for the Microscope, consisting of innumerable


Perforations, and Ramifications, disposed in an endless Variety of


Forms.





        3. The Flesh of all Land and Sea Animals dried, and cut into


very thin Slices, gives a beautiful View of the various Fibres, and


their Convolutions.  The Brain, the spinal Marrow, and even the Hairs


of Animals, exhibit different Curiosities.





        4. The human Skin, by the Help of the Microscope, is found to


be covered over with an infinite Number of Scales lying over one


another, as in fishes; and it is probably the same in other Animals.


It has been computed that a Grain of Sand will cover two hundred of


these Scales.





        5. All Sorts of Feathers, especially those of the Peacock,


afford a surprizing View in the Microscope.  It is supposed that a


single Feather contains no less than a Million of different Parts.





        6. Flies are found by the Microscope to be produced from Eggs


laid by the Mothers, from whence they are hatched in the Form of


Maggots, or small Worms, which are afterwards transformed into


Aurelias, and these into perfect Flies.  This is the Process most of


the winged Insects go through in their Production.  They have a great


Number of Eyes fixed to their Heads, so that they see on all Sides


around them, without turning their Heads or Eyes.  A common Fly is


supposed to have eight thousand, and a great Drone Fly no less than


fourteen thousand Eyes, with a distinct optic Nerve to each; and each


Eye appears through the Microscope, tho' magnified many hundred


thousand Times, more exactly shaped, and more curiously polished,


than human Art could finish an Object as large as the whole Cluster,


containing seven thousand distinct ones.  The Wings of Flies,


especially of the Moth and Butterfly Kind, are found to be contrived


with admirable Art, to answer their Use, and with inimitable Beauty


and Ornament.  The Dust, which sticks to the Fingers, when we handle


them, is found to be Feathers; each of which has its Quill and vane


Parts as compleat as that of a Fowl or a Goose, and are inserted in


the Film of the Wing, with the utmost Regularity of Arrangement.


With the Microscope, the Stings of Moths and Bees appear to be


Instruments finished to the highest Perfection; their Points, and


saw-like Teeth, being perfectly polished and sharp; whereas the Edge


of a Razor appears like that of a Butcher's Cleaver, and the Point of


a Lancet like an iron Spike just come from the Anvil.





        7. By the Help of the Microscope the innumerable and


inconceivably minute Animalcules in various Fluids are discovered, of


the Existence of which we have no Reason to suppose any Mortal had


the least Suspicion, till last Century.  In the Melt of a single


Cod-fish ten Times more living Creatures are contained, than the


Inhabitants of _Europe_, _Asia_, _Africa_, and _America_, taking it


for granted, that all Parts of the World are as well peopled as


_Holland_, which is very far from being the Case.  Of a certain


Species some are discovered so extremely minute, that it has been


computed, three Millions of them, or three Times the Number of the


Inhabitants of _London_ and _Westminster_, would not equal the Bulk


of a Grain of Sand.  Of Animalcules, some Species resemble Tadpoles,


Serpents or Eels, others are of a roundish or oval Form, others of


very curiously turned and various Shapes; but in general they are


extremely vigorous and lively, and almost constantly in Motion.


Animalcules are to be found (besides those in the Bodies of Animals)


in the Infusions of Pepper, Senna, Pinks, Roses, Jessamin, Tea,


Rasberry Stalks, Fennel, Sage, Melons, sour Grapes, Wheat, Hay,


Straw, and almost all vegetable Substances; in the Water, that is in


the Shells of Oysters, Cockles, and other Shell-fish, in the Foulness


upon our Teeth, and those of other Animals, in our Skins when


affected with certain Diseases; in Vinegar, and Paste, and so on


infinitely.  In each of these Substances, when exposed to the Air


some Time, Multitudes of living Creatures, beyond the Reach of


Numbers, are discovered, of which many Hundreds of Species are


already known, as different from one another as those of the largest


Animals, and very probably there are many more yet unknown.  As it is


certain, that in the above mentioned Fluids few or no Animalcules are


to be found, when covered from the Air, but when open to the Access


of the Air, their Numbers are beyond reckoning; it is hardly to be


doubted, but that either the Air is replete with infinite Multitudes


of living Creatures too small for Sight, which come and deposite


their Eggs in Places proper for the Nutrition of the Young, or that


their Eggs are floating every where in the Air, and falling


promiscuously every where, only those are hatched, or come to


Perfection, which fall upon Places fitted for them, and the others


perish.  However it is, the countless Numbers of those living


Creatures, the Profusion of Life every where to be observed, is above


Measure astonishing, and shews the Maker to be an infinite Being.





        8. By the Help of the Microscope, we find that the Scales of


almost every different Fish are different from those of others, in


internal Texture; and that all of them are wrought with surprising


Art and Beauty.





        9. By Means of this noble Instrument we find, that the Seeds of


almost all Manner of Vegetables contain in them the Stamina of the


future Plant or Tree, and that their Production from the Seed, and


their Growth to Maturity is only the Swelling and Enlarging of the


Stamina by the Addition of nutritious Juices.  It is probable the


Manner of Production and Growth of Animals is analogous to this.  The


Fertility of some Plants is almost beyond Belief.  One particularly


is said by Naturalists to produce annually a Million of Seeds from


one.  The Farina of Flowers is found by the Help of the Microscope to


be a regular organized Body, and not a meer Dust, as it appears to


the naked Eye, and is reasonably supposed to be necessary to


Fertility in Plants and Trees.





        10. By the Microscope have been discovered many singular


Properties of that most unaccountable of all Creatures the Polype,


which is found at the Bottom of Ditches, and standing Waters; whose


Manner of Production, Feeding and Digestion, are different from those


of all other Animals.  The young ones come out of the Sides of the


old, like Buds and Branches from Trees, and at length drop off


perfect Polypes.  They do not seem to be of different Sexes.  They


take in Worms, and other Sustenance, by Means of a Sett of long Arms


or _Antennae_, which surround their Mouths, and after keeping them


some Time in their Stomachs, throw them out again the same Way.  The


Animal's Body consists of a single Cavity, like a Tube or Gut, and


what is wonderful, and almost beyond Belief, is, that it will live


and feed after it is turned inside out, and even when cut into a


great many Pieces, each several Piece becomes a compleat Polype.


They are infested with a Kind of Vermin, as are almost all Animals


from the largest down to Bees and other Insects.  These Vermin


sometimes in a long Time will eat up the Head and Part of the Body of


a Polype, after which, if it be cleared of them, it shall have the


devoured Parts grow up again, and become as compleat as ever.  Some


Polypes have around their Mouths a Sort of Plume, which they whirl


round, and making with it an Eddy in the Water, draw in their Prey,


and devour it.





        11. By the Microscope it is found, that neither the Wood, the


Bark, the Root, the Leaves, the Fruit, nor even the Pith of the


meanest Vegetable is a Mass of crude or indigested Matter; but that


every different Species is different in its internal Structure, and


all curiously and delicately wrought.  A Bit of Cork, cut extremely


thin, a Slice of Oak or Fir, or a Bit of Elder Pith, in the


Microscope, are so many curious Pieces of _Mosaic_ Work.  Even a Bit


of Charcoal or burnt Wood appears with the Microscope an admirable


Object.





        12. By this Instrument it is found, that what we call


Mouldiness upon Flesh, Leather, or other Substances, is no other than


a great Number of extremely small, but perfect Plants, having Stalks


and Tops like Mushrooms, and sometimes an Appearance of Leaves.  The


Seeds of these minute Plants must, in all Probability, be diffused


universally through the Air, and falling upon Substances fit for


their Growth, spring up in astonishing Profusion.  There is, in


short, no End of microscopic Objects.  A Sprig of Moss, with the Help


of that Instrument, is found to be a regular Plant, consisting of a


Root, a Stock, Branches, Leaves, _&c._ and Naturalists tell us, there


are some Hundreds of different Species of it.  A Bit of Spunge before


the Microscope is a curious Piece of Net-work.  Every different


chymical Salt has its Parts differently figured.  A Leaf of a common


stinging Nettle, the Beard of a wild Oat, the Surfaces of some


Pebble-stones, a Flake of Snow, a few Grains of Sand, or almost any


natural Thing, with this Instrument, exhibit exquisite Beauties;


while, on the contrary, the most delicate Works of Art, can by no


Means bear its Examination; but degenerate before it into Masses of


Irregularity, and Deformity.

        It is an amusing Speculation to look back, and compute what


Numbers of Men and Women among the Ancients, clubb'd their Endeavours

which was sold for a Half-penny a Button, continually doubled.

Thousand, Five Hundred and Seventy-six noble Ancestors.  Carry the


Reckoning back 300 Years farther, and the Number amounts to above 500


Millions; which are more than exist at any one Time upon Earth, and


shews the Impossibility of preserving Blood free from such Mixtures,


and that the Pretension of such Purity of Blood in ancient Families


is a mere Joke.  Hence we see how it happens that every Nation has a


kind of general Cast of Feature, by which it may be distinguished;


continual Intermarriages for a Course of Ages rendring all the People


related by Blood, and, as it were, of one Family.

        COURTEOUS READER,


        This is the twentieth Time of my addressing thee in this


Manner, and I have reason to flatter myself my Labours have not been


unacceptable to the Publick.  I am particularly pleas'd to understand


that my _Predictions of the Weather_ give such general Satisfaction;


and indeed, such Care is taken in the Calculations, on which those


Predictions are founded, that I could almost venture to say, there's


not a single One of them, promising _Snow_, _Rain_, _Hail_, _Heat_,


_Frost_, _Fogs_, _Wind_, or _Thunder_, but what comes to pass


_punctually_ and _precisely_ on the very Day, in some Place or other


on this little _diminutive_ Globe of ours; (and when you consider the


vast Distance of the Stars from whence we take our Aim, you must


allow it no small Degree of Exactness to hit any Part of it) I say on


this Globe; for tho' in other Matters I confine the Usefulness of my


_Ephemeris_ to the _Northern Colonies_, yet in that important Matter


of the Weather, which is of such _general Concern_, I would have it


more extensively useful, and therefore take in both Hemispheres, and


all Latitudes from _Hudson's Bay_ to _Cape Horn._





        You will find this Almanack in my former Method, only


conformable to the _New-Stile_ established by the Act of Parliament,

intended only to regulate some Corporation Matters in _England_,


before unprovided for.  I have only added a Column in the second Page


of each Month, containing the Days of the _Old Stile_ opposite to


their corresponding Days in the _New_, which may, in many Cases, be


of Use; and so conclude (believing you will excuse a short Preface,


when it is to make Room for something better)

the House by a few small Staples.  If the House or Barn be long,


there may be a Rod and Point at each End, and a middling Wire along


the Ridge from one to the other.  A House thus furnished will not be


damaged by Lightning, it being attracted by the Points, and passing


thro the Metal into the Ground without hurting any Thing.  Vessels


also, having a sharp pointed Rod fix'd on the Top of their Masts,


with a Wire from the Foot of the Rod reaching down, round one of the

        _Poor Richard Improved_


        1752





        KIND READER,


        Since the King and Parliament have thought fit to alter our


Year, by taking eleven Days out of _September_, 1752, and directing


us to begin our Account for the future on the First of _January_,


some Account of the Changes the Year hath heretofore undergone, and


the Reasons of them, may a little gratify thy Curiosity.





        The Vicissitude of _Seasons_ seems to have given Occasion to


the first Institution of the _Year._ Man naturally curious to know


the Cause of that Diversity, soon found it was the Nearness and


Distance of the Sun; and upon this, gave the Name _Year_ to the Space


of Time wherein that Luminary, performing his whole Course, returned


to the same Point of his Orbit.





        And hence, as it was on Account of the Seasons, in a great


Measure, that the _Year_ was instituted, their chief Regard and


Attention was, that the same Parts of the _Year_ should always


correspond to the same Seasons; _i. e._ that the Beginning of the


Year should always be when the Sun was in the same Point of his


Orbit; and that they should keep Pace, come round, and end together.





        This, different Nations aimed to attain by different Ways;


making the _Year_ to commence from different Points of the Zodiac;


and even the Time of his Progress different.  So that some of their


Years were much more perfect than others, but none of them quite


just; _i. e._ none of them but whose Parts shifted with Regard to the


Parts of the Sun's Course.





        It was the _Egyptians_, if we may credit _Herodotus_, that


first formed the _Year_, making it to contain 360 Days, which they


subdivided into twelve Months, of thirty Days each.





        _Mercury Trismegistus_ added five Days more to the Account. --


And on this Footing _Thales_ is said to have instituted the Year


among the _Greeks._ Tho' that Form of the Year did not hold


throughout all _Greece._ Add that the _Jewish_, _Syrian_, _Roman_,


_Persian_, _Ethiopic_, _Arabic_, &c.  Years, are all different.





        In effect, considering the poor State of Astronomy in those


Ages, it is no Wonder different People should disagree in the


Calculus of the Sun's Course.  We are even assured by _Diodorus


Siculus_, _Plutarch_, and _Pliny_, that the _Egyptian Year_ itself


was at first very different from what it became afterwards.





        According to our Account, the _Solar Year_, or the Interval of


Time in which the Sun finishes his Course thro' the Zodiac, and


returns to the same Point thereof from which he had departed, is 365


Days, 5 Hours, 49 Minutes; tho' some Astronomers make it a few


Seconds, and some a whole Minute less; as _Kepler_, for Instance, who


makes it 365 Days, 5 Hours, 48 Minutes, 57 Seconds, 39 Thirds.


_Ricciolus_, 365 Days, 5 Hours, 48 Minutes.  _Tycho Brahe_, 365 Days,


5 Hours, 48 Minutes.





        The _Civil Year_ is that Form of the _Year_ which each Nation


has contrived to compute Time by; or the _Civil_ is the _Tropical


Year_, considered as only consisting of a certain Number of whole


Days; the odd Hours and Minutes being set aside, to render the


Computation of Time in the common Occasions of Life more easy.





        Hence as the _Tropical Year_ is 365 Days, 5 Hours, 49 Minutes;


the _Civil Year_ is 365 Days.  And hence also, as it is necessary to


keep Pace with the Heavens, it is required that every fourth Year


consist of 366 Days, which would for ever keep the Year exactly


right, if the odd Hours of each Year were precisely 6.





        The ancient _Roman Year_, as first settled by _Romulus_,


consisted of ten Months only; _viz._ I. _March_, containing 31 Days.


II. _April_, 30. III. _May_, 31. IV. _June_ 30. V. _Quintilis_, 31.


VI. _Sextilis_, 30. VII. _September_, 30. VIII. _October_, 31. IX.


_November_, 30. X. _December_, 30; in all 304 Days; which came short


of the _Solar Year_, by 61 Days.





        Hence the Beginning of _Romulus_'s Year was vague, and unfixed


to any precise Season; which Inconvenience to remove, that Prince


ordered so many Days to be added yearly, as would make the State of


the Heavens correspond to the first Month, without incorporating


these additional Days, or calling them by the Name of any Month.





        _Numa Pompilius_ corrected this irregular Constitution of the


Year, and composed two new Months, _January_ and _February_, of the


Days that were used to be added to the former Year.  Thus, _Numa_'s


_Year_ consisted of twelve Months; _viz._ I. _January_, containing 29


Days.  II. _February_, 28.  III. _March_, 31.  IV. _April_, 29.  V.


_May_, 31.  VI. _June_, 29.  VII. _Quintilis_, 31.  VIII. _Sextilis_,


29.  IX. _September_, 29.  X. _October_, 31.  XI. _November_, 29.


XII. _December_, 29; in all 355 Days, which came short of the common


Solar Year by ten Days; so that its Beginning was vague and unfixed.





        _Numa_, however, desiring to have it fixed to the Winter


Solstice, ordered 22 Days to be intercalated in _February_ every


second Year, 23 every fourth, 22 every sixth, and 23 every eighth


Year.





        But this Rule failing to keep Matters even, Recourse was had to


a new Way of Intercalating; and instead of 23 Days every eighth Year,


only 15 were added; and the Care of the whole committed to the


_Pontifex Maximus_, or High Priest; who, neglecting the Trust, let


Things run to the utmost Confusion.  And thus the _Roman_ Year stood


till _Julius Caesar_ made a Reformation.





        The _Julian Year_, is a Solar Year, containing commonly 365


Days; tho' every fourth Year, called _Bissextile_, contains 366. --


The Names and Order of the Months of the _Julian Year_, and the


Number of Days in each, are well known to us, having been long in


Use.





        The astronomical Quantity, therefore, of the _Julian Year_, is


365 Days, 6 Hours, which exceeds the true Solar Year by 11 Minutes;


which Excess in 131 Years amounts to a whole Day. -- And thus the


_Roman Year_ stood, till the Reformation made therein by Pope


_Gregory._





        _Julius Caesar_, in the Contrivance of his Form of the Year,


was assisted by _Sosigenes_, a famous Mathematician, called over from


_Egypt_ for this very Purpose; who, to supply the Defect of 67 Days


which had been lost thro' the Fault of the High Priests, and to fix


the Beginning of the Year to the Winter Solstice, made that Year to


consist of 15 Months, or 445 Days; which for that Reason is used to


be called _Annus Confusionis_, the _Year of Confusion._





        This Form of the Year was used by all Christian Nations, till


the Middle of the 16th Century; and still continues to be so by


several Nations; among the Rest, by the _Swedes_, _Danes_, &c. and by


the _English_ till the second of _September_ next, when they are to


assume the Use of the _Gregorian Year._





        The GREGORIAN YEAR is the _Julian Year_ corrected by this Rule;


that whereas on the common Footing, every Secular or Hundredth Year,


is _Bissextile_; on the new Footing, three of them are common Years,


and only the fourth _Bissextile._





        The Error of eleven Minutes in the _Julian Year_, little as it


was, yet, by being repeated over and over, at length became


considerable; and from the Time when _Caesar_ made his Correction,


was grown into 13 Days, by which the Equinoxes were greatly


disturbed.  To remedy this Irregularity, which was still a growing,


Pope _Gregory_ the XIII. called together the chief Astronomers of his


Time, and concerted this Correction; and to restore the Equinoxes to


their Place threw out the ten Days that had been got from the Council


of _Nice_, and which had shifted the fifth of _October_ to the 15th.





        In the Year 1700, the Error of ten Days was grown to eleven;


upon which the Protestant States of _Germany_, to prevent further


Confusion, accepted the _Gregorian_ Correction.  And now in 1752, the


_English_ follow their Example.





        Yet is the _Gregorian Year_ far from being perfect, for we have


shewn, that, in four Centuries, the _Julian Year_ gains three Days,


one Hour, twenty Minutes: But it is only the three Days are kept out


in the _Gregorian Year_; so that here is still an Excess of one Hour,


twenty Minutes, in four Centuries; which in 72 Centuries will amount


to a whole Day.





        As to the Commencement of the Year, the _legal Year_ in


_England_ used to begin on the Day of the _Annunciation_; _i. e._ on


the 25th of _March_; tho' the historical Year began on the Day of the


_Circumcision_; _i. e._ the first of _January_, on which Day the


_Italian_ and _German_ Year also begins; and on which Day ours is to


begin from this Time forward, the first Day of _January_ being now by


Act of Parliament declared the first Day of the Year 1752.





        At the Yearly Meeting of the People called _Quakers_, held in


_London_, since the Passing of this Act, it was agreed to recommend


to their Friends a Conformity thereto, both in omitting the eleven


Days of _September_ thereby directed to be omitted, and beginning the


Year hereafter on the first Day of the Month called _January_, which


is henceforth to be by them called and written, _The First Month_,


and the rest likewise in their Order, so that _September_ will now be


the _Ninth Month_, _December_ the _Twelfth._





        This _Act of Parliament_, as it contains many Matters of


Importance, and extends expresly to all the _British Colonies_, I


shall for the Satisfaction of the Publick, give at full length:


Wishing withal, according to ancient Custom, that this _New Year_


(which is indeed a New Year, such an one as we never saw before, and


shall never see again) may be a happy Year to all my kind Readers.


                                         I am, Your faithful Servant,

        COURTEOUS READER,

        As I spent some Weeks last Winter, in visiting my old


Acquaintance in the _Jerseys_, great Complaints I heard for Want of


Money, and that Leave to make more Paper Bills could not be obtained.


_Friends and Countrymen_, my Advice on this Head shall cost you


nothing, and if you will not be angry with me for giving it, I


promise you not to be offended if you do not take it.





        You spend yearly at least _Two Hundred Thousand Pounds_, 'tis


said, in _European_, _East-Indian_, and _West-Indian_ Commodities:


Supposing one Half of this Expence to be in _Things absolutely


necessary_, the other Half may be call'd _Superfluities_, or at best,


Conveniences, which however you might live without for one little


Year, and not suffer exceedingly.  Now to save this Half, observe


these few Directions.








        1. When you incline to have new Cloaths, look first well over


the old Ones, and see if you cannot shift with them another Year,


either by Scouring, Mending, or even Patching if necessary.  Remember


a Patch on your Coat, and Money in your Pocket, is better and more


creditable than a Writ on your Back, and no Money to take it off.





        2. When you incline to buy China Ware, Chinces, _India_ Silks,


or any other of their flimsey slight Manufactures; I would not be so


hard with you, as to insist on your absolutely _resolving against


it_; all I advise, is, to _put it off_ (as you do your Repentance)


_till another Year_; and this, in some Respects, may prevent an


Occasion of Repentance.





        3. If you are now a Drinker of Punch, Wine or Tea, twice a Day;


for the ensuing Year drink them but _once_ a Day.  If you now drink


them but once a Day, do it but every other Day.  If you do it now but


once a Week, reduce the Practice to once a Fortnight.  And if you do


not exceed in Quantity as you lessen the Times, half your Expence in


these Articles will be saved.





        4thly and lastly, When you incline to drink Rum, fill the Glass


_half_ with Water.





        Thus at the Year's End, there will be _An Hundred Thousand


Pounds_ more Money in your Country.





        If Paper Money in ever so great a Quantity could be made, no


Man could get any of it without giving something for it.  But all he


saves in this Way, will be _his own for nothing_; and his Country


actually so much richer.  Then the Merchants old and doubtful Debts


may be honestly paid off, and Trading become surer thereafter, if not


so extensive.

        Well, my Friend, thou art now just entering the last Month of


another Year.  If thou art a Man of Business, and of prudent Care,


belike thou wilt now settle thy Accounts, to satisfy thyself whether


thou hast gain'd or lost in the Year past, and how much of either,


the better to regulate thy future Industry or thy common Expences.


This is commendable. -- But it is not all. -- Wilt thou not examine


also thy _moral_ Accompts, and see what Improvements thou hast made


in the Conduct of Life, what Vice subdued, what Virtue acquired; how


much _better_, and how much _wiser_, as well as how much _richer_


thou art grown?  What shall it _profit_ a Man, if he _gain_ the whole

        COURTEOUS READER,


        As no temporal Concern is of more Importance to us than


_Health_, and that depends so much on the Air we every Moment


breathe, the Choice of a good wholesome Situation to fix a Dwelling


in, is a very serious Affair to every Countryman about to begin the


World, and well worth his Consideration, especially as not only the


_Comfort_ of Living, but even the _Necessaries of Life_, depend in a


great Measure upon it; since a Family frequently sick can rarely if


ever thrive. -- The following Extracts therefore from a late Medical


Writer, Dr. _Pringle_, on that Subject, will, I hope, be acceptable


and useful to some of my Readers.





        I hear that some have already, to their great Advantage, put in


Practice the Use of Oxen recommended in my last. -- 'Tis a Pleasure


to me to be any way serviceable in communicating useful Hints to the


Publick; and I shall be obliged to others for affording me the


Opportunity of enjoying that Pleasure more frequently, by sending me


from time to time such of their own Observations, as may be


advantageous if published in the Almanack.


                                         _I am thy obliged Friend,_


                                                 RICHARD SAUNDERS.

        _How to make a_ STRIKING SUNDIAL, _by which not only a Man's


own Family, but all his Neighbours for ten Miles round, may know what


o Clock it is, when the Sun shines, without seeing the Dial._





        Choose an open Place in your Yard or Garden, on which the Sun


may shine all Day without any Impediment from Trees or Buildings.  On


the Ground mark out your Hour Lines, as for a horizontal Dial,


according to Art, taking Room enough for the Guns.  On the Line for


One o' Clock, place one Gun; on the Two o' Clock Line two Guns, and


so of the rest.  The Guns must all be charged with Powder, but Ball


is unnecessary.  Your Gnomon or Style must have twelve burning


Glasses annex'd to it, and be so placed as that the Sun shining


through the Glasses, one after the other, shall cause the Focus or


burning Spot to fall on the Hour Line of One, for Example, at one a


Clock, and there kindle a Train of Gunpowder that shall fire one Gun.


At Two a Clock, a Focus shall fall on the Hour Line of Two, and


kindle another Train that shall discharge two Guns successively; and


so of the rest.





        Note, There must be 78 Guns in all.  Thirty-two Pounders will


be best for this Use; but 18 Pounders may do, and will cost less, as


well as use less Powder, for nine Pounds of Powder will do for one


Charge of each eighteen Pounder, whereas the Thirty-two Pounders


would require for each Gun 16 Pounds.





        Note also, That the chief Expence will be the Powder, for the


Cannon once bought, will, with Care, last 100 Years.





        Note moreover, That there will be a great Saving of Powder in


cloudy Days.





        Kind Reader, Methinks I hear thee say, _That it is indeed a


good Thing to know how the Time passes, but this Kind of Dial,


notwithstanding the mentioned Savings, would be very expensive; and


the Cost greater than the Advantage._ Thou art wise, my Friend, to be


so considerate beforehand; some Fools would not have found out so


much, till they had made the Dial and try'd it. -- Let all such learn


that many a private and many a publick Project, are like this


_Striking Dial_, great Cost for little Profit.

        Since Man is but of a very limited Power in his own Person, and


consequently can effect no great Matter merely by his own personal


Strength, but as he acts in Society and Conjunction with others; and


since no Man can engage the active Assistance of others, without


first engaging their Trust; And moreover, since Men will trust no


further than they judge one, for his _Sincerity_, fit to be trusted;


it follows, that a discovered Dissembler can atchieve nothing great


or considerable.  For not being able to gain Mens Trust, he cannot


gain their Concurrence; and so is left alone to act singly and upon


his own Bottom; and while that is the Sphere of his Activity, all

        It is generally agreed to be Folly, _to hazard the Loss of a


Friend, rather than lose a Jest._ But few consider how easily a


Friend may be thus lost.  Depending on the known Regard their Friends


have for them, Jesters take more Freedom with Friends than they would


dare to do with others, little thinking how much deeper we are


wounded by an Affront from one we love.  But the strictest Intimacy


can never warrant Freedoms of this Sort; and it is indeed


preposterous to think they should; unless we can suppose Injuries are


less Evils when they are done us by Friends, than when they come from


other Hands.





        Excess of Wit may oftentimes beguile:


        Jests are not always pardon'd -- by a Smile.


        Men may disguise their Malice at the Heart,


        And seem at Ease -- tho' pain'd with inward Smart.


        Mistaken, we -- think all such Wounds of course


        Reflection cures; -- alas! it makes them worse.


        Like Scratches they with double Anguish seize,


        Rankle in time, and fester by Degrees.





        But sarcastical Jests on a Man's Person or his Manners, tho'


hard to bear, are perhaps more easily borne than those that touch his


Religion.  Men are generally warm in what regards their religious


Tenets, either from Tenderness of Conscience, or a high Sense of


their own Judgments.  People of plain Parts and honest Dispositions,


look on Salvation as too serious a Thing to be jested with; and Men


of speculative Religion, who profess from the Conviction rather of


their Heads than Hearts, are not a bit less vehement than the real


Devotees.  He who says a slight or a severe Thing of their Faith,


seems to them to have thereby undervalued their Understandings, and


will consequently incur their Aversion, which no Man of common Sense


would hazard for a lively Expression; much less a Person of good


Breeding, who should make it his chief Aim to be well with all.





        Like some grave Matron of a noble Line,


        With awful Beauty does Religion shine.


        Just Sense should teach us to revere the Dame,


        Nor, by imprudent Jests, to spot her Fame.


        In common Life you'll own this Reas'ning right,


        That none but Fools in gross Abuse delight:


        Then use it here -- nor think the Caution vain;

        COURTEOUS READER,


        It is a common Saying, that _One Half of the World does not


know how the other Half lives._ To add somewhat to your Knowledge in


that Particular, I gave you in a former Almanack, an Account of the


Manner of living at _Hudson's-Bay_, and the Effects produced by the


excessive Cold of that Climate, which seem'd so strange to some of


you, that it was taken for a Romance, tho' really authentick. -- In


this, I shall give you some Idea of a Country under the Torrid Zone,


which for the Variety of its Weather (where one would naturally


expect the greatest Uniformity) is extreamly remarkable.  The Account


is extracted from the Journal of Monsieur _Bouguer_, one of the


_French_ Academicians, sent by their King to measure a Degree of


Latitude under the Equinoctial, in order to settle a Dispute between


the _English_ and _French_ Philosophers concerning the Shape of the


Earth, others being at the same Time sent for the same Purpose to


_Lapland_, under the Polar Circle. -- The Mountains in that Country


are so lofty, that the highest we have, being compared to them, are


mere Mole-hills.  This Extract relates chiefly to the Country among


those Mountains.





        The Method of this Almanack is the same I have observed for


some Years past; only in the third Column the Names of some of the


principal fixed Stars are put down against those Days on which they


come to the Meridian at nine a Clock in the Evening, whereby those


unacquainted, may learn to know them.  I am,

        Kind READER,


        I have now serv'd you three Apprenticeships, yet, old as I am,


I have no Inclination to quit your Service, but should be glad to be


able to continue in it three times three Apprenticeships longer.





        The first _Astrologers_ I think, were honest Husbandmen; and so


it seems are the last; for my Brethren _Jerman_ and _Moore_, and


myself, the only remaining Almanack-makers of this Country, are all


of that Class: Tho' in intermediate Times our Art has been cultivated


in great Cities, and even in the Courts of Princes; witness History,


from the Days of King NEBUCHADNEZZAR I. of _Babylon_, to those of


Queen JAMES I. of _England._ -- But you will ask, perhaps, how I


prove that the first Astrologers were Countrymen? -- I own this is a


Matter beyond the Memory of History, for Astrology was before


Letters; but I prove it from the Book of the Heavens, from the Names


of the twelve Signs, which were mostly given to remark some


Circumstance relative to rural Affairs, in the several successive


Months of the Year, and by that Means to supply the Want of


Almanacks. -- Thus, as the Year of the Ancients began most naturally


with the Spring, _Aries_ and _Taurus_, that is, the Ram and the Bull,


represented the successive Addition to their Flocks of Sheep and


Kine, by their Produce in that Season, Lambs and Calves. -- _Gemini_


were originally the Kids, but called the Twins, as Goats more


commonly bring forth two than one: These follow'd the Calves. --


_Cancer_, the Crab, came next, when that Kind of Fish were in Season.


-- Then follow'd _Leo_, the Lion, and _Virgo_, the Wench, to mark the


Summer Months, and Dog-days, when those Creatures were most


mischievous.  In Autumn comes first _Libra_, the Ballance, to point


out the Time for weighing and selling the Summer's Produce; or


rather, a Time of Leisure for holding Courts of Justice in which they


might plague themselves and Neighbours; I know some suppose this Sign


to signify the equal Poise, at that Time, of Day and Night; but the


other Signification is the truer, as plainly appears by the following


Sign _Scorpio_, or the Scorpion, with the Sting in his Tail, which


certainly denotes the Paying of Costs. -- Then follows _Sagittary_,


the Archer, to show the Season of Hunting; for now the Leaves being


off the Trees and Bushes, the Game might be more easily seen and


struck with their Arrows. -- The _Goat_ accompanies the short Days


and long Nights of Winter, to shew the Season of Mirth, Feasting and


Jollity; for what can _Capricorn_ mean, but Dancing or Cutting of


_Capers_? -- At length comes _Aquarius_, or the Water-bearer, to show


the Season of Snows, Rains and Floods; and lastly _Pisces_, or the


two Shads, to denote the approaching Return of those Fish up the


Rivers: Make your Wears, hawl your Seins; Catch 'em and pickle 'em,


my Friends; they are excellent Relishers of old Cyder. -- But if you


can't get Shad, Mackrell may do better.





        I know, gentle Readers, that many of you always expect a


Preface, and think yourselves slighted if that's omitted.  So here


you have it, and much good may't do ye.  As little as it is to the


Purpose, there are many less so, now-a-days. -- I have left out, you


see, all the usual Stuff about the _Importunity of Friends_, and the


like, or I might have made it much bigger.  You think, however, that


'tis big enough o'Conscience, for any Matter of Good that's in it; --


I think so too, if it fills the Page, which is the Needful at


present, from

        You may give a Man an Office, but you cannot give him


Discretion.





        He that doth what he should not, shall feel what he would not.





        To be intimate with a foolish Friend, is like going to bed to a


Razor.





        Little Rogues easily become great Ones.





        You may sometimes be much in the wrong, in owning your being in


the right.





        _Friends_ are the true Sceptres of Princes.





        Where Sense is wanting, every thing is wanting.





        Many Princes sin with _David_, but few repent with him.





        He that hath no _ill_ Fortune will be troubled with _good._





        For Age and Want save while you may;


        No Morning Sun lasts a whole Day.





        Learning to the Studious; Riches to the Careful; Power to the


Bold; Heaven to the Virtuous.





        Now glad the Poor with _Christmas_ Cheer;


        Thank God you're able so to end the Year.

        _Poor Richard_


        1738





        PREFACE by Mistress SAUNDERS





        _Dear Readers,_


         My good Man set out last Week for _Potowmack_, to visit an


old Stargazer of his Acquaintance, and see about a little Place for


us to settle and end our Days on.  He left the Copy of his Almanack


seal'd up, and bid me send it to the Press.  I suspected something,


and therefore as soon as he was gone, I open'd it, to see if he had


not been flinging some of his old Skitts at me.  Just as I thought,


so it was.  And truly, (for want of somewhat else to say, I suppose)


he had put into his Preface, that his Wife _Bridget_ -- was this, and


that, and t'other. -- What a peasecods! cannot I have a little Fault


or two, but all the Country must see it in print!  They have already


been told, at one time that I am proud, another time that I am loud,


and that I have got a new Petticoat, and abundance of such kind of


stuff; and now, forsooth! all the World must know, that _Poor Dick's_


Wife has lately taken a fancy to drink a little Tea now and then.  A


mighty matter, truly, to make a Song of!  'Tis true; I had a little


Tea of a Present from the Printer last Year; and what, must a body


throw it away?  In short, I thought the Preface was not worth a


printing, and so I fairly scratch'd it all out, and I believe you'll


like our Almanack never the worse for it.





        Upon looking over the Months, I see he has put in abundance of


foul Weather this Year; and therefore I have scatter'd here and


there, where I could find room, some _fair, pleasant, sunshiny,_ &c.


for the Good-Women to dry their Clothes in.  If it does not come to


pass according to my Desire, I have shown my Good-will, however; and


I hope they'll take it in good part.





        I had a Design to make some other Corrections; and particularly


to change some of the Verses that I don't very well like; but I have


just now unluckily broke my Spectacles; which obliges me to give it


you as it is, and conclude


                                         _Your loving Friend,_


                                     _BRIDGET SAUNDERS._


                                 ______





        There are three faithful friends, an old wife, an old dog, and


ready money.





        Great talkers should be cropt, for they've no need of ears.





        If you'd have your shoes last, put no nails in 'em.





        Who has deceiv'd thee so oft as thy self?








        Is there any thing Men take more pains about than to render


themselves unhappy?





        Nothing brings more pain than too much pleasure; nothing more


bondage than too much liberty, (or libertinism.)





        Read much, but not many Books.





        He that would have a short Lent, let him borrow Money to be


repaid at Easter.





        Write with the learned, pronounce with the vulgar.





        Fly Pleasures, and they'll follow you.





        Squirrel-like she covers her back with her tail.





        _Caesar_ did not merit the triumphal Car, more than he that


conquers himself.





        Hast thou virtue? acquire also the graces & beauties of virtue.








        Buy what thou hast no need of; and e'er long thou shalt sell


thy necessaries.





        If thou hast wit & learning, add to it Wisdom and Modesty.





        You may be more happy than Princes, if you will be more


virtuous.





        If you wou'd not be forgotten


        As soon as you are dead and rotten,


        Either write things worth reading,


        or do things worth the writing.





        Sell not virtue to purchase wealth, nor Liberty to purchase


power.





        God bless the King, and grant him long to Reign.





        Let thy vices die before thee.





        Keep your eyes wide open before marriage, half shut afterwards.





        The ancients tell us what is best; but we must learn of the


moderns what is fittest.





 


        Since I cannot govern my own tongue, tho' within my own teeth,


how can I hope to govern the tongues of others?





        'Tis less discredit to abridge petty charges, than to stoop to


petty Gettings.





        Since thou art not sure of a minute, throw not away an hour.





        If you do what you should not, you must hear what you would


not.





        Defer not thy well-doing; be not like St. _George_, who is


always a horseback, and never rides on.





        Wish not so much to live long as to live well.





        As we must account for every idle word, so we must for every


idle silence.





        I have never seen the Philosopher's Stone that turns lead into


Gold, but I have known the pursuit of it turn a Man's Gold into Lead.





        Never intreat a servant to dwell with thee.





        Time is an herb that cures all Diseases.





        Reading makes a full Man, Meditation a profound Man, discourse


a clear Man.





        If any man flatters me, I'll flatter him again; tho' he were my


best Friend.





        Wish a miser long life, and you wish him no good.





        None but the well-bred man knows how to confess a fault, or


acknowledge himself in an error.





        Drive thy business; let not that drive thee.





        There is much difference between imitating a good man, and


counterfeiting him.





        Wink at small faults; remember thou hast great ones.





        Eat to please thyself, but dress to please others.





        Search others for their virtues, thy self for thy vices.








        Never spare the Parson's wine, nor Baker's Pudding.





        Each year one vicious habit rooted out,


        In time might make the worst Man good throughout.








.




        _Poor Richard_


        1739





        _Kind Reader,_


        Encouraged by thy former Generosity, I once more present thee


with an Almanack, which is the 7th of my Publication. -- While thou


art putting Pence in my Pocket, and furnishing my Cottage with


Necessaries, _Poor Dick_ is not unmindful to do something for thy


Benefit.  The Stars are watch'd as narrowly as old _Bess_ watch'd her


Daughter, that thou mayst be acquainted with their Motions, and told


a Tale of their Influences and Effects, which may do thee more good


than a Dream of last Year's Snow.





        Ignorant Men wonder how we Astrologers foretell the Weather so


exactly, unless we deal with the old black Devil.  Alas! 'tis as easy


as pissing abed.  For Instance; The Stargazer peeps at the Heavens


thro' a long Glass: He sees perhaps _TAURUS_, or the great Bull, in a


mighty Chase, stamping on the Floor of his House, swinging his Tail


about, stretching out his Neck, and opening wide his Mouth.  'Tis


natural from these Appearances to judge that this furious Bull is


puffing, blowing, and roaring.  Distance being consider'd, and Time


allow'd for all this to come down, there you have Wind and Thunder.


He spies perhaps _VIRGO_ (or the Virgin;) she turns her Head round as


it were to see if any body observ'd her; then crouching down gently,


with her Hands on her Knees, she looks wistfully for a while right


forward.  He judges rightly what she's about: And having calculated


the Distance and allow'd Time for it's Falling, finds that next


Spring we shall have a fine _April_ shower.  What can be more natural


and easy than this?  I might instance the like in many other


particulars; but this may be sufficient to prevent our being taken


for Conjurers.  O the wonderful Knowledge to be found in the Stars!


Even the smallest Things are written there, if you had but Skill to


read.  When my Brother _J -- m --n_ erected a Scheme to know which


was best for his sick Horse, to sup a new-laid Egg, or a little


Broth, he found that the Stars plainly gave their Verdict for Broth,


and the Horse having sup'd his Broth; -- Now, what do you think


became of that Horse?  You shall know in my next.





        Besides the usual Things expected in an Almanack, I hope the


profess'd Teachers of Mankind will excuse my scattering here and


there some instructive Hints in Matters of Morality and Religion.


And be not thou disturbed, O grave and sober Reader, if among the


many serious Sentences in my Book, thou findest me trifling now and


then, and talking idly.  In all the Dishes I have hitherto cook'd for


thee, there is solid Meat enough for thy Money.  There are Scraps


from the Table of Wisdom, that will if well digested, yield strong


Nourishment to thy Mind.  But squeamish Stomachs cannot eat without


Pickles; which, 'tis true are good for nothing else, but they provoke


an Appetite.  The Vain Youth that reads my Almanack for the sake of


an idle Joke, will perhaps meet with a serious Reflection, that he


may ever after be the better for.





        Some People observing the great Yearly Demand for my Almanack,


imagine I must by this Time have become rich, and consequently ought


to call myself _Poor Dick_ no longer.  But, the Case is this, When I


first begun to publish, the Printer made a fair Agreement with me for


my Copies, by Virtue of which he runs away with the greatest Part of


the Profit. -- However, much good may't do him; I do not grudge it


him; he is a Man I have a great Regard for, and I wish his Profit ten


times greater than it is.  For I am, dear Reader, his, as well as thy


_Affectionate Friend_,


                                         _R. SAUNDERS._


                                 ______


 


        When Death puts out our Flame, the Snuff will tell,


        If we were Wax, or Tallow by the Smell.





        At a great Pennyworth, pause a while.





        As to his Wife, _John_ minds St. _Paul_, He's one


        That hath a Wife, and is as if he'd none.





        Kings a be an Honour to them tho' they are dead.








        If thou wouldst live long, live well; for Folly and Wickedness


shorten Life.





        Prythee isn't Miss _Cloe's_ a comical Case?


        She lends out her Tail, and she borrows her Face.





        Trust thy self, and another shall not betray thee.





        He that pays for Work before it's done, has but a pennyworth


for twopence.





        Historians relate, not so much what is done, as what they would


have believed.





        O Maltster! break that cheating Peck; 'tis plain,


        When e'er you use it, you're a Knave in Grain.





        Doll learning _propria quae maribus_ without book,


        Like _Nomen crescentis genitivo_ doth look.





        Grace thou thy House, and let not that grace thee.





        Thou canst not joke an Enemy into a Friend; but thou may'st a


Friend into an Enemy.





        Eyes & Priests


        Bear no Jests.





        He that falls in love with himself, will have no Rivals.





        Let thy Child's first Lesson be Obedience, and the second may


be what thou wilt.





        Blessed is he that expects nothing, for he shall never be


disappointed.





        Rather go to bed supperless, than run in debt for a Breakfast.





        Let thy Discontents be Secrets.





        An infallible Remedy for the _Tooth-ach_, viz Wash the Root of


an aching Tooth, in _Elder Vinegar_, and let it dry half an hour in


the Sun; after which it will never ach more; _Probatum est_.





        A Man of Knowledge like a rich Soil, feeds


        If not a world of Corn, a world of Weeds.








        A modern Wit is one of _David's_ Fools.





        No Resolution of Repenting hereafter, can be sincere.





        _Pollio_, who values nothing that's within,


        Buys books as men hunt Beavers, -- for their Skin.





        Honour thy Father and Mother, _i.e._ Live so as to be an Honour


to them tho' they are dead.





        If thou injurest Conscience, it will have its Revenge on thee.





        Hear no ill of a Friend, nor speak any of an Enemy.





        Pay what you owe, and you'll know what's your own.





        Be not niggardly of what costs thee nothing, as courtesy,


counsel, & countenance.





        Thirst after Desert, not Reward.





        Beware of him that is slow to anger: He is angry for something,


and will not be pleased for nothing.





        No longer virtuous no longer free; is a Maxim as true with


regard to a private Person as a Common-wealth.





        When Man and Woman die, as Poets sung,


        His Heart's the last part moves, her last, the tongue.





        Proclaim not all thou knowest, all thou owest, all thou hast,


nor all thou canst.





        Let our Fathers and Grandfathers be valued for _their_


Goodness, ourselves for our own.





        Industry need not wish.





        Sin is not hurtful because it is forbidden but it is forbidden


because it's hurtful.  Nor is a Duty beneficial because it is


commanded, but it is commanded, because it's beneficial.





        _A_ ---- , they say, has Wit; for what?


        For writing? -- No; For writing not.





        _George_ came to the Crown without striking a Blow.


        Ah! quoth the Pretender, would I could do so.





        Love, and be lov'd.





        O Lazy-Bones!  Dost thou think God would have given thee Arms


and Legs, if he had not design'd thou should'st use them.





        A Cure for Poetry,


        Seven wealthy Towns contend for _Homer_, dead,


        Thro' which the living _Homer_ beg'd his Bread.





        Great Beauty, great strength, & great Riches, are really &


truly of no great Use; a right Heart exceeds all.


.




        _Poor Richard_


        1737





        _Courteous and kind Reader,_


        This is the fifth Time I have appear'd in Publick, chalking out


the future Year for my honest Countrymen, and foretelling what shall,


and what may, and what may not come to pass; in which I have the


Pleasure to find that I have given general Satisfaction.  Indeed,


among the Multitude of our astrological Predictions, 'tis no wonder


if some few fail; for, without any Defect in the Art itself, 'tis


well known that a small Error, a single wrong Figure overseen in a


Calculation, may occasion great Mistakes: But however we


Almanack-makers may _miss it_ in other Things, I believe it will be


generally allow'd _That we always hit the Day of the Month_, and that


I suppose is esteem'd one of the most useful Things in an Almanack.





        As to the Weather, if I were to fall into the Method my Brother


_J ----- n _ sometimes uses, and tell you, _Snow here or in New


England, -- Rain here or in South-Carolina, -- Cold to the Northward,


-- Warm to the Southward_, and the like, whatever Errors I might


commit, I should be something more secure of not being detected in


them: But I consider, it will be of no Service to any body to know


what Weather it is 1000 miles off, and therefore I always set down


positively what Weather my Reader will have, be he where he will at


the time.  We modestly desire only the favourable Allowance of _a day


or two before_ and _a day or two after_ the precise Day against which


the Weather is set; and if it does not come to pass accordingly, let


the Fault be laid upon the Printer, who, 'tis very like, may have


transpos'd or misplac'd it, perhaps for the Conveniency of putting in


his Holidays: And since, in spight of all I can say, People will give


him great part of the Credit of making my Almanacks, 'tis but


reasonable he should take some share of the Blame.





        I must not omit here to thank the Publick for the gracious and


kind Encouragement they have hitherto given me: But if the generous


Purchaser of my Labours could see how often his _Fi'-pence_ helps to


light up the comfortable Fire, line the Pot, fill the Cup and make


glad the Heart of a poor Man and an honest good old Woman, he would


not think his Money ill laid out, tho' the Almanack of his were one


half blank Paper.


                 _Friend and Servant     R. SAUNDERS_





                                 ______





        HINTS for those that would be Rich.





        The Use of Money is all the Advantage there is in having Money.





        For 6 _l._ a Year, you may have the Use of 100 _l._ if you are


a Man of known Prudence and Honesty.





        He that spends a Groat a day idly, spends idly above 6 _l._ a


year, which is the Price of using 100 _l._





        He that wastes idly a Groat's worth of his Time per Day, one


Day with another, wastes the Privilege of using 100 _l._ each Day.





        He that idly loses 5 _s._ worth of time, loses 5 _s._ & might


as prudently throw 5 _s._ in the River.








        He that loses 5 _s._ not only loses that Sum, but all the


Advantage that might be made by turning it in Dealing, which by the


time that a young Man becomes old, amounts to a comfortable Bag of


Mony.





        _Again_, He that sells upon Credit, asks a Price for what he


sells, equivalent to the Principal and Interest of his Money for the


Time he is like to be kept out of it: therefore





        He that buys upon Credit, pays Interest for what he buys.





        And he that pays ready Money, might let that Money out to Use:


so that





        He that possesses any Thing he has bought, pays Interest for


the Use of it.





        _Consider then_, when you are tempted to buy any unnecessary


Housholdstuff, or any superfluous thing, whether you will be willing


to pay _Interest, _and Interest upon Interest_ for it as long as you

        1736





        _Loving Readers,_


        Your kind Acceptance of my former Labours, has encouraged me to


continue writing, tho' the general Approbation you have been so good


as to favour me with, has excited the Envy of some, and drawn upon me


the Malice of others.  These Ill-willers of mine, despited at the


great Reputation I gain'd by exactly predicting another Man's Death,


have endeavour'd to deprive me of it all at once in the most


effectual Manner, by reporting that I my self was never alive.  They


say in short, _That there is no such a Man as I am_; and have spread


this Notion so thoroughly in the Country, that I have been frequently


told it to my Face by those that don't know me.  This is not civil


Treatment, to endeavour to deprive me of my very Being, and reduce me


to a Non-entity in the Opinion of the publick.  But so long as I know


my self to walk about, eat, drink and sleep, I am satisfied that


_there is really such a Man as I am_, whatever they may say to the


contrary: And the World may be satisfied likewise; for if there were


no such Man as I am, how is it possible I should appear publickly to


hundreds of People, as I have done for several Years past, in print?


I need not, indeed, have taken any Notice of so idle a Report, if it


had not been for the sake of my Printer, to whom my Enemies are


pleased to ascribe my Productions; and who it seems is as unwilling


to father my Offspring, as I am to lose the Credit of it: Therefore


to clear him entirely, as well as to vindicate my own Honour, I make


this publick and serious Declaration, which I desire may be believed,


to wit, _That what I have written heretofore, and do now write,


neither was nor is written by any other Man or Men, Person or Persons


whatsoever._ Those who are not satisfied with this, must needs be


very unreasonable.





        My Performance for this Year follows; it submits itself, kind


Reader, to thy Censure, but hopes for thy Candor, to forgive its


Faults.  It devotes itself entirely to thy Service, and will serve


thee faithfully: And if it has the good Fortune to please its Master,

        Poor Richard


        1734





        _Courteous Readers,_


        Your kind and charitable Assistance last Year, in purchasing so


large an Impression of my Almanacks, has made my Circumstances much


more easy in the World, and requires my grateful Acknowledgment.  My


Wife has been enabled to get a Pot of her own, and is no longer


oblig'd to borrow one from a Neighbour; nor have we ever since been


without something of our own to put in it.  She has also got a pair


of Shoes, two new Shifts, and a new warm Petticoat; and for my part,


I have bought a second-hand Coat, so good, that I am now not asham'd


to go to Town or be seen there.  These Things have render'd her


Temper so much more pacifick than it us'd to be, that I may say, I


have slept more, and more quietly within this last Year, than in the


three foregoing Years put together.  Accept my hearty Thanks


therefor, and my sincere Wishes for your Health and Prosperity.





        In the Preface to my last Almanack, I foretold the Death of my


dear old Friend and Fellow-Student, the learned and ingenious Mr.


_Titan Leeds_, which was to be on the 17th of _October_, 1733, 3 h.


29 m. _P.M._ at the very Instant of the xxx of xxx and xxx.  By his


own Calculation he was to survive till the 26th of the same Month,


and expire in the Time of the Eclipse, near 11 a clock, _A.M._ At


which of these Times he died, or whether he be really yet dead, I


cannot at this present Writing positively assure my Readers;


forasmuch as a Disorder in my own Family demanded my Presence, and


would not permit me as I had intended, to be with him in his last


Moments, to receive his last Embrace, to close his Eyes, and do the


Duty of a Friend in performing the last Offices to the Departed.


Therefore it is that I cannot positively affirm whether he be dead or


not; for the Stars only show to the Skilful, what will happen in the


natural and universal Chain of Causes and Effects; but 'tis well


known, that the Events which would otherwise certainly happen at


certain Times in the Course of Nature, are sometimes set aside or


postpon'd for wise and good Reasons, by the immediate particular


Dispositions of Providence; which particular Dispositions the Stars


can by no Means discover or foreshow.  There is however, (and I


cannot speak it without Sorrow) there is the strongest Probability


that my dear Friend is _no more_; for there appears in his Name, as I


am assured, an Almanack for the Year 1734, in which I am treated in a


very gross and unhandsome Manner; in which I am called _a false


Predicter, an Ignorant, a conceited Scribler, a Fool, and a Lyar._


Mr. _Leeds_ was too well bred to use any Man so indecently and so


scurrilously, and moreover his Esteem and Affection for me was


extraordinary: So that it is to be feared, that Pamphlet may be only


a Contrivance of somebody or other, who hopes perhaps to sell two or


three Year's Almanacks still, by the sole Force and Virtue of Mr.


_Leeds_'s Name; but certainly, to put Words into the Mouth of a


Gentleman and a Man of Letters, against his Friend, which the meanest


and most scandalous of the People might be asham'd to utter even in a


drunken Quarrel, is an unpardonable Injury to his Memory, and an


Imposition upon the Publick.





        Mr. _Leeds_ was not only profoundly skilful in the useful


Science he profess'd, but he was a Man of _exemplary Sobriety_, a


most _sincere Friend_, and an _exact Performer of his Word._ These


valuable Qualifications, with many others, so much endear'd him to


me, that although it should be so, that, contrary to all Probability,


contrary to my Prediction and his own, he might possibly be yet


alive, yet my Loss of Honour as a Prognosticator, cannot afford me so


much Mortification, as his Life, Health and Safety would give me Joy


and Satisfaction.  I am,

        _Poor Richard_


        1735





        _Courteous Reader,_


        This is the third Time of my appearing in print, hitherto very


much to my own Satisfaction, and, I have reason to hope, to the


Satisfaction of the Publick also; for the Publick is generous, and


has been very charitable and good to me.  I should be ungrateful


then, if I did not take every Opportunity of expressing my Gratitude;


for _ingratum si dixeris, omnia dixeris_: I therefore return the


Publick my most humble and hearty Thanks.





        Whatever may be the Musick of the Spheres, how great soever the


Harmony of the Stars, 'tis certain there is no Harmony among the


Stargazers; but they are perpetually growling and snarling at one


another like strange Curs, or like some Men at their Wives: I had


resolved to keep the Peace on my own part, and affront none of them;


and I shall persist in that Resolution: But having receiv'd much


Abuse from _Titan Leeds_ deceas'd, (_Titan Leeds_ when living would


not have us'd me so!) I say, having receiv'd much Abuse from the


Ghost of _Titan Leeds_, who pretends to be still living, and to write


Almanacks in spight of me and my Predictions, I cannot help saying,


that tho' I take it patiently, I take it very unkindly.  And whatever


he may pretend, 'tis undoubtedly true that he is really defunct and


dead.  First because the Stars are seldom disappointed, never but in


the Case of wise Men, _Sapiens dominabitur astris_, and they


foreshow'd his Death at the Time I predicted it.  Secondly, 'Twas


requisite and necessary he should die punctually at that Time, for


the Honour of Astrology, the Art professed both by him and his Father


before him.  Thirdly, 'Tis plain to every one that reads his two last


Almanacks (for 1734 and 35) that they are not written with that


_Life_ his Performances use to be written with; the Wit is low and


flat, the little Hints dull and spiritless, nothing smart in them but


_Hudibras_'s Verses against Astrology at the Heads of the Months in


the last, which no Astrologer but a _dead one_ would have inserted,


and no Man _living_ would or could write such Stuff as the rest.  But


lastly, I shall convince him from his own Words, that he is dead,


(_ex ore suo condemnatus est_) for in his Preface to his Almanack for


1734, he says, _"Saunders adds another_ GROSS FALSHOOD _in his


Almanack,_ viz. _that by my own Calculation I shall_ survive _until


the_ 26th _of the said Month October_ 1733, _which is as_ untrue _as


the former."_ Now if it be, as _Leeds_ says, _untrue_ and a _gross


Falshood_ that he surviv'd till the 26th of October 1733, then it is


certainly _true_ that he died _before_ that Time: And if he died


before that Time, he is dead now, to all Intents and Purposes, any


thing he may say to the contrary notwithstanding.  And at what Time


before the 26th is it so likely he should die, as at the Time by me


predicted, _viz._ the 17th of October aforesaid?  But if some People


will walk and be troublesome after Death, it may perhaps be born with


a little, because it cannot well be avoided unless one would be at


the Pains and Expence of laying them in the _Red Sea_; however, they


should not presume too much upon the Liberty allow'd them; I know


Confinement must needs be mighty irksome to the free Spirit of an


Astronomer, and I am too compassionate to proceed suddenly to


Extremities with it; nevertheless, tho' I resolve with Reluctance, I


shall not long defer, if it does not speedily learn to treat its


living Friends with better Manners.  I am,

        Poor Richard's Almanack


        1733





        Courteous Reader_,


        I might in this place at tempt to gain thy Favour, by declaring


that I write Almanacks with no other View than that of the publick


Good; but in this I should not be sincere; and Men are now a-days too


wise to be deceiv'd by Pretences how specious soever.  The plain


Truth of the Matter is, I am excessive poor, and my Wife, good Woman,


is, I tell her, excessive proud; she cannot bear, she says, to sit


spinning in her Shift of Tow, while I do nothing but gaze at the


Stars; and has threatned more than once to burn all my Books and


Rattling-Traps (as she calls my Instruments) if I do not make some


profitable Use of them for the good of my Family.  The Printer has


offer'd me some considerable share of the Profits, and I have thus


begun to comply with my Dame's desire.





        Indeed this Motive would have had Force enough to have made me


publish an Almanack many Years since, had it not been overpower'd by


my Regard for my good Friend and Fellow-Student, Mr. _Titan Leeds_,


whose Interest I was extreamly unwilling to hurt: But this Obstacle


(I am far from speaking it with Pleasure) is soon to be removed,


since inexorable Death, who was never known to respect Merit, has


already prepared the mortal Dart, the fatal Sister has already


extended her destroying Shears, and that ingenious Man must soon be


taken from us.  He dies, by my Calculation made at his Request, on


_Oct._ 17. 1733. 3 ho. 29 m. _P.M._ at the very instant of the xxx of


xxx and xxx: By his own Calculation he will survive till the 26th of


the same Month.  This small difference between us we have disputed


whenever we have met these 9 Years past; but at length he is


inclinable to agree with my Judgment; Which of us is most exact, a


little Time will now determine.  As therefore these Provinces may not


longer expect to see any of his Performances after this Year, I think


my self free to take up the Task, and request a share of the publick


Encouragement; which I am the more apt to hope for on this Account,


that the Buyer of my Almanack may consider himself, not only as


purchasing an useful Utensil, but as performing an Act of Charity, to


his poor _Friend and Servant_


                                 _R. SAUNDERS._

        _Poor Richard_


        1740





        _Courteous Reader,_ OCTOBER 7. 1739.


        You may remember that in my first Almanack, published for the


Year 1733, I predicted the Death of my dear Friend _Titan Leeds_,


Philomat. to happen that Year on the 17th Day of _October_, 3 h. 29


m. _P.M._ The good Man, it seems, died accordingly: But _W.B._ and


_A.B._ have continued to publish Almanacks in his Name ever since;


asserting for some Years that he was still living; At length when the


Truth could no longer be conceal'd from the World, they confess his


Death in their Almanack for 1739, but pretend that he died not till


last Year, and that before his Departure he had furnished them with


Calculations for 7 Years to come.  Ah, _My Friends_, these are poor


Shifts and thin Disguises; of which indeed I should have taken little


or no Notice, if you had not at the same time accus'd me as a false


Predictor; an Aspersion that the more affects me, as my whole


Livelyhood depends on a contrary Character.





        But to put this Matter beyond Dispute, I shall acquaint the


World with a Fact, as strange and surprizing as it is true; being as


follows, _viz._





        On the 4th Instant, towards midnight, as I sat in my little


Study writing this Preface, I fell fast asleep; and continued in that


Condition for some time, without dreaming any thing, to my Knowledge.


On awaking, I found lying before me the following Letter, _viz._





        Dear Friend SAUNDERS,


        My Respect for you continues even in this separate State, and I


am griev'd to see the Aspersions thrown on you by the Malevolence of


avaricious Publishers of Almanacks, who envy your Success.  They say


your Prediction of my Death in 1733 was false, and they pretend that


I remained alive many Years after.  But I do hereby certify, that I


did actually die at that time, precisely at the Hour you mention'd,


with a Variation only of 5 _min._ 53 _sec._ which must be allow'd to


be no great matter in such Cases.  And I do farther declare that I


furnish'd them with no Calculations of the Planets Motions, _&c._


seven Years after my Death, as they are pleased to give out: so that


the Stuff they publish as an Almanack in my Name is no more mine than


'tis yours.





        You will wonder perhaps, how this Paper comes written on your


Table.  You must know that no separate Spirits are under any


Confinement till after the final Settlement of all Accounts.  In the


mean time we wander where we please, visit our old Friends, observe


their Actions, enter sometimes into their Imaginations, and give them


Hints waking or sleeping that may be of Advantage to them.  Finding


you asleep, I entred your left Nostril, ascended into your Brain,


found out where the Ends of those Nerves were fastned that move your


right Hand and Fingers, by the Help of which I am now writing unknown


to you; but when you open your Eyes, you will see that the Hand


written is mine, tho' wrote with yours.





        The People of this Infidel Age, perhaps, will hardly believe


this Story.  But you may give them these three Signs by which they


shall be convinc'd of the Truth of it.  About the middle of _June_


next, _J. J ------ n_, Philomat, shall be openly reconciled to the


_Church of Rome_, and give all his Goods and Chattles to the Chappel,


being perverted by a certain _Country School-master._ On the 7_th_ of


_September_ following my old Friend _W. B ------ t_ shall be sober 9


Hours, to the Astonishment of all his Neighbours: And about the same


time _W.B._ and _A.B._ will publish another Almanack in my Name, in


spight of Truth and Common-Sense.





        As I can see much clearer into Futurity, since I got free from


the dark Prison of Flesh, in which I was continually molested and


almost blinded with Fogs arising from Tiff, and the Smoke of burnt


Drams; I shall in kindness to you, frequently give you Informations


of things to come, for the Improvement of your Almanack: Being Dear


_Dick_,


                                 _Your affectionate Friend,  T. Leeds_.





        For my own part I am convinc'd that the above Letter is


genuine.  If the Reader doubts of it, let him carefully observe the


three Signs; and if they do not actually come to pass, believe as he


pleases.


                                         _I am his humble Friend,_


                                                 _R. SAUNDERS_.

        To bear other Peoples Afflictions, every one has Courage


enough, and to spare.

        Makes his whole Life but one continual Dinner.

        the Rich too much, enough not one.

Wit enough to be honest.





        Who says Jack is not generous? he is always fond of giving, and


cares not for receiving. -- What?  Why; Advice.





        The Man who with undaunted toils,


        sails unknown seas to unknown soils,


        With various wonders feasts his Sight:


        What stranger wonders does he write?





        Fear not Death; for the sooner we die, the longer shall we be


immortal.





        Those who in quarrels interpose,


        Must often wipe a bloody nose.





        Promises may get thee Friends, but Nonperformance will turn


them into Enemies.





        In other men we faults can spy,


        And blame the mote that dims their eye;


        Each little speck and blemish find;


        To our own stronger errors blind.





        When you speak to a man, look on his eyes; when he speaks to


thee, look on his mouth.





        _Jane_, why those tears? why droops your head?


        Is then your other husband dead?


        Or doth a worse disgrace betide?


        Hath no one since his death apply'd?





        Observe all men; thy self most.





        Thou hadst better eat salt with the Philosophers of _Greece_,


than sugar with the Courtiers of _Italy._





        Seek Virtue, and, of that possest,


        To Providence, resign the rest.





        Marry above thy match, and thou'lt get a Master.





        Fear to do ill, and you need fear nought else.





        He makes a Foe who makes a jest.





        Can grave and formal pass for wise,


        When Men the solemn Owl despise?





        Some are justly laught at for keeping their Money foolishly,


others for spending it idly: He is the greatest fool that lays it out


in a purchase of repentance.





        Who knows a fool, must know his brother;


        For one will recommend another.





        Avoid dishonest Gain: No price;

        Great souls with gen'rous pity melt;


        Which coward tyrants never felt.





        Employ thy time well, if thou meanest to gain leisure.

        Enjoy the present hour, be mindful of the past;


        And neither fear nor wish the Approaches of the last.





        Learn of the skilful: He that teaches himself, hath a fool for


his master.





        Best is the Tongue that feels the rein; --


        He that talks much, must talk in vain;

        Think _Cato_ sees thee.





        No Wood without Bark.





        _Monkeys_ warm with envious spite,

        And, fond to copy human Ways,

        _Joke_ went out, and brought home his fellow, and they two


began a quarrel.





        Let thy discontents be thy Secrets; -- if the world knows them,


'twill despise _thee_ and increase _them._





        E'er you remark another's Sin,


        Bid your own Conscience look within.





        Anger and Folly walk cheek-by-jole; Repentance treads on both


their Heels.





        Turn Turk _Tim_, and renounce thy Faith in Words as well as


Actions: Is it worse to follow _Mahomet_ than the Devil?

        _Nick's_ Passions grow fat and hearty; his Understanding looks


consumptive!





        If evils come not, then our fears are vain:


        And if they do, Fear but augments the pain.





        If you would keep your Secret from an enemy, tell it not to a


friend.





        Rob not for burnt offerings.





        _Bess_ brags she 'as _Beauty_, and can prove the same;

enough.





        Well done, is twice done.





        Clearly spoken, Mr. Fog!  You explain English by Greek.





        _Formio_ bewails his Sins with the same heart,

        Believe it _Formio_ will not entertain,


        One chearful Thought till they do meet again.





        Honours change Manners.





        Jack eating rotten cheese, did say,


        Like _Sampson_ I my thousands slay;


        I vow, quoth _Roger_, so you do,


        And with the self-same weapon too.





        There are no fools so troublesome as those that have wit.





        Quarrels never could last long,


        If on one side only lay the wrong.





        Let no Pleasure tempt thee, no Profit allure thee, no Ambition


corrupt thee, no Example sway thee, no Persuasion move thee, to do


any thing which thou knowest to be Evil; So shalt thou always live


jollily: for a good Conscience is a continual Christmass.

        _Poor Richard Improved_


        1758





         COURTEOUS READER,


         I have heard that nothing gives an Author so great Pleasure,


as to find his Works respectfully quoted by other learned Authors.


This Pleasure I have seldom enjoyed; for tho' I have been, if I may


say it without Vanity, an _eminent Author_ of Almanacks annually now


a full Quarter of a Century, my Brother Authors in the same Way, for


what Reason I know not, have ever been very sparing in their


Applauses; and no other Author has taken the least Notice of me, so


that did not my Writings produce me some solid _Pudding_, the great


Deficiency of _Praise_ would have quite discouraged me.





        I concluded at length, that the People were the best Judges of


my Merit; for they buy my Works; and besides, in my Rambles, where I


am not personally known, I have frequently heard one or other of my


Adages repeated, with, _as Poor Richard says_, at the End on't; this


gave me some Satisfaction, as it showed not only that my Instructions


were regarded, but discovered likewise some Respect for my Authority;


and I own, that to encourage the Practice of remembering and


repeating those wise Sentences, I have sometimes _quoted myself_ with


great Gravity.





        Judge then how much I must have been gratified by an Incident I


am going to relate to you.  I stopt my Horse lately where a great


Number of People were collected at a Vendue of Merchant Goods.  The


Hour of Sale not being come, they were conversing on the Badness of


the Times, and one of the Company call'd to a plain clean old Man,


with white Locks, _Pray, Father_ Abraham, _what think you of the


Times?  Won't these heavy Taxes quite ruin the Country?  How shall we


be ever able to pay them?  What would you advise us to? -- _ Father


_Abraham_ stood up, and reply'd, If you'd have my Advice, I'll give


it you in short, for a _Word to the Wise is enough_, and _many Words


won't fill a Bushel_, as _Poor Richard says._ They join'd in desiring


him to speak his Mind, and gathering round him, he proceeded as


follows;





        Friends, says he, and Neighbours, the Taxes are indeed very


heavy, and if those laid on by the Government were the only Ones we


had to pay, we might more easily discharge them; but we have many


others, and much more grievous to some of us.  We are taxed twice as


much by our _Idleness_, three times as much by our _Pride_, and four


times as much by our _Folly_, and from these Taxes the Commissioners


cannot ease or deliver us by allowing an Abatement.  However let us


hearken to good Advice, and something may be done for us; _God helps


them that help themselves_, as _Poor Richard_ says, in his Almanack


of 1733.





        It would be thought a hard Government that should tax its


People one tenth Part of their _Time_, to be employed in its Service.


But _Idleness_ taxes many of us much more, if we reckon all that is


spent in absolute _Sloth_, or doing of nothing, with that which is


spent in idle Employments or Amusements, that amount to nothing.


_Sloth_, by bringing on Diseases, absolutely shortens Life.  _Sloth,


like Rust, consumes faster than Labour wears, while the used Key is


always bright_, as _Poor Richard_ says.  But _dost thou love Life,


then do not squander Time, for that's the Stuff Life is made of_, as


_Poor Richard_ says. -- How much more than is necessary do we spend


in Sleep! forgetting that _The sleeping Fox catches no Poultry_, and


that _there will be sleeping enough in the Grave_, as _Poor Richard_


says.  If Time be of all Things the most precious, _wasting Time_


must be, as _Poor Richard_ says, _the greatest Prodigality_, since,


as he elsewhere tells us, _Lost Time is never found again_; and what


we call _Time-enough, always proves little enough_: Let us then up


and be doing, and doing to the Purpose; so by Diligence shall we do


more with less Perplexity.  _Sloth makes all Things difficult, but


Industry all easy_, as _Poor Richard_ says; and _He that riseth late,


must trot all Day, and shall scarce overtake his Business at Night._


While _Laziness travels so slowly, that Poverty soon over-takes him_,


as we read in _Poor Richard_, who adds, _Drive thy Business, let not


that drive thee_; and _Early to Bed, and early to rise, makes a Man


healthy, wealthy and wise._





        So what signifies _wishing_ and _hoping_ for better Times.  We


may make these Times better if we bestir ourselves.  _Industry need


not wish_, as _Poor Richard_ says, and _He that lives upon Hope will


die fasting.  There are no Gains, without Pains_; then _Help Hands,


for I have no Lands_, or if I have, they are smartly taxed.  And, as


_Poor Richard_ likewise observes, _He that hath a Trade hath an


Estate_, and _He that hath a Calling hath an Office of Profit and


Honour_; but then the _Trade_ must be worked at, and the _Calling_


well followed, or neither the _Estate_, nor the _Office_, will enable


us to pay our Taxes. -- If we are industrious we shall never starve;


for, as _Poor Richard_ says, _At the working Man's House_ Hunger


_looks in, but dares not enter._ Nor will the Bailiff or the


Constable enter, for _Industry pays Debts, while Despair encreaseth


them_, says _Poor Richard. -- _ What though you have found no


Treasure, nor has any rich Relation left you a Legacy, _Diligence is


the Mother of Good-luck,_ as _Poor Richard_ says, and _God gives all


Things to Industry._ Then _plough deep, while Sluggards sleep, and


you shall have Corn to sell and to keep,_ says _Poor Dick._ Work


while it is called To-day, for you know not how much you may be


hindered To-morrow, which makes _Poor Richard_ say, _One To-day is


worth two To-morrows_; and farther, _Have you somewhat to do


To-morrow, do it To-day._ If you were a Servant, would you not be


ashamed that a good Master should catch you idle?  Are you then your


own Master, _be ashamed to catch yourself idle_, as _Poor Dick_ says.


When there is so much to be done for yourself, your Family, your


Country, and your gracious King, be up by Peep of Day; _Let not the


Sun look down and say, Inglorious here he lies._ Handle your Tools


without Mittens; remember that _the Cat in Gloves catches no Mice_,


as _Poor Richard_ says.  'Tis true there is much to be done, and


perhaps you are weak handed, but stick to it steadily, and you will


see great Effects, for _constant Dropping wears away Stones_, and by


_Diligence and Patience the Mouse ate in two the Cable_; and _little


Strokes fell great Oaks_, as _Poor Richard_ says in his Almanack, the


Year I cannot just now remember.





        Methinks I hear some of you say, _Must a Man afford himself no


Leisure? -- _ I will tell thee, my Friend, what _Poor Richard_ says,


_Employ thy Time well if thou meanest to gain Leisure_; and, _since


thou art not sure of a Minute, throw not away an Hour._ Leisure, is


Time for doing something useful; this Leisure the diligent Man will


obtain, but the lazy Man never; so that, as _Poor Richard_ says, a


_Life of Leisure and a Life of Laziness are two Things._ Do you


imagine that Sloth will afford you more Comfort than Labour?  No, for


as _Poor Richard_ says, _Trouble springs from Idleness, and grievous


Toil from needless Ease.  Many without Labour, would live by their_


WITS _only, but they break for want of Stock._ Whereas Industry gives


Comfort, and Plenty, and Respect: _Fly Pleasures, and they'll follow


you.  The diligent Spinner has a large Shift_; and _now I have a


Sheep and a Cow, every Body bids me Good morrow_; all which is well


said by _Poor Richard._








        But with our Industry, we must likewise be _steady_, _settled_


and _careful_, and oversee our own Affairs _with our own Eyes_, and


not trust too much to others; for, as _Poor Richard_ says,





                 _I never saw an oft removed Tree,


                 Nor yet an oft removed Family,


                 That throve so well as those that settled be._





        And again, _Three Removes is as bad as a Fire_; and again,


_Keep thy Shop, and thy Shop will keep thee_; and again, _If you


would have your Business done, go; If not, send._ And again,





        _He that by the Plough would thrive,


        Himself must either hold or drive._





        And again, _The Eye of a Master will do more Work than both his


Hands_; and again, _Want of Care does us more Damage than Want of


Knowledge_; and again, _Not to oversee Workmen, is to leave them your


Purse open._ Trusting too much to others Care is the Ruin of many;


for, as the _Almanack_ says, _In the Affairs of this World, Men are


saved, not by Faith, but by the Want of it_; but a Man's own Care is


profitable; for, saith _Poor Dick_, _Learning is to the Studious_,


and _Riches to the Careful_, as well as _Power to the Bold_, and


_Heaven to the Virtuous._ And farther, _If you would have a faithful


Servant, and one that you like, serve yourself._ And again, he


adviseth to Circumspection and Care, even in the smallest Matters,


because sometimes _a little Neglect may breed great Mischief_;


adding, _For want of a Nail the Shoe was lost; for want of a Shoe the


Horse was lost; and for want of a Horse the Rider was lost_, being


overtaken and slain by the Enemy, all for want of Care about a


Horse-shoe Nail.





        So much for Industry, my Friends, and Attention to one's own


Business; but to these we must add _Frugality_, if we would make our


_Industry_ more certainly successful.  A Man may, if he knows not how


to save as he gets, _keep his Nose all his Life to the Grindstone_,


and die not worth a _Groat_ at last.  _A fat Kitchen makes a lean


Will_, as _Poor Richard_ says; and,





        _Many Estates are spent in the Getting,


        Since Women for Tea forsook Spinning and Knitting,


        And Men for Punch forsook Hewing and Splitting.





        If you would be wealthy,_ says he, in another Almanack, _think


of Saving as well as of Getting: The_ Indies _have not made_ Spain


_rich, because her_ Outgoes _are greater than her_ Incomes.  Away


then with your expensive Follies, and you will not have so


much Cause to complain of hard Times, heavy Taxes, and chargeable


Families; for, as _Poor Dick_ says,





        _Women and Wine, Game and Deceit,


        Make the Wealth small, and the Wants great._





        And farther, _What maintains one Vice, would bring up two


Children._ You may think perhaps, That a _little_ Tea, or a _little_


Punch now and then, Diet a _little_ more costly, Clothes a _little_


finer, and a _little_ Entertainment now and then, can be no _great_


Matter; but remember what _Poor Richard_ says, _Many_ a Little _makes


a Mickle_; and farther, _Beware of_ little _Expences_; _a small Leak


will sink a great Ship_; and again, _Who Dainties love, shall Beggars


prove_; and moreover, _Fools make Feasts, and wise Men eat them._





        Here you are all got together at this Vendue of _Fineries_ and


_Knicknacks._ You call them _Goods_, but if you do not take Care,


they will prove _Evils_ to some of you.  You expect they will be sold


_cheap_, and perhaps they may for less than they cost; but if you


have no Occasion for them, they must be _dear_ to you.  Remember what


_Poor Richard_ says, _Buy what thou hast no Need of, and ere long


thou shalt sell thy Necessaries._ And again, _At a great Pennyworth


pause a while_: He means, that perhaps the Cheapness is _apparent_


only, and not _real_; or the Bargain, by straitning thee in thy


Business, may do thee more Harm than Good.  For in another Place he


says, _Many have been ruined by buying good Pennyworths._ Again,


_Poor Richard_ says, _'Tis foolish to lay out Money in a Purchase of


Repentance_; and yet this Folly is practised every Day at Vendues,


for want of minding the Almanack.  _Wise Men_, as _Poor Dick_ says,


_learn by others Harms, Fools scarcely by their own_; but, _Felix


quem faciunt aliena Pericula cautum._ Many a one, for the Sake of


Finery on the Back, have gone with a hungry Belly, and half starved


their Families; _Silks and Sattins, Scarlet and Velvets,_ as _Poor


Richard_ says, _put out the Kitchen Fire._ These are not the


_Necessaries_ of Life; they can scarcely be called the


_Conveniencies_, and yet only because they look pretty, how many


_want_ to _have_ them.  The _artificial_ Wants of Mankind thus become


more numerous than the _natural_; and, as _Poor Dick_ says, _For one_


poor _Person, there are an hundred_ indigent.  By these, and other


Extravagancies, the Genteel are reduced to Poverty, and forced to


borrow of those whom they formerly despised, but who through


_Industry_ and _Frugality_ have maintained their Standing; in which


Case it appears plainly, that a _Ploughman on his Legs is higher than


a Gentleman on his Knees_, as _Poor Richard_ says.  Perhaps they have


had a small Estate left them, which they knew not the Getting of;


they think _'tis Day, and will never be Night_; that a little to be


spent out of _so much_, is not worth minding; _(a Child and a Fool,_


as _Poor Richard_ says, _imagine_ Twenty Shillings _and Twenty Years


can never be spent)_ but, _always taking out of the Meal-tub, and


never putting in, soon comes to the Bottom_; then, as _Poor Dick_


says, _When the Well's dry, they know the Worth of Water._ But this


they might have known before, if they had taken his Advice; _If you


would know the Value of Money, go and try to borrow some_; for, _he


that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing_; and indeed so does he that


lends to such People, when he goes _to get it in again._ -- _Poor


Dick_ farther advises, and says,





        _Fond_ Pride of Dress, _is sure a very Curse;


        E'er_ Fancy _you consult, consult your Purse._





        And again, _Pride is as loud a Beggar as Want, and a great deal


more saucy._ When you have bought one fine Thing you must buy ten


more, that your Appearance may be all of a Piece; but _Poor Dick_


says, _'Tis easier to_ suppress _the first Desire, than to_ satisfy


_all that follow it._ And 'tis as truly Folly for the Poor to ape the


Rich, as for the Frog to swell, in order to equal the Ox.





        _Great Estates may venture more,


        But little Boats should keep near Shore._





        'Tis however a Folly soon punished; for _Pride that dines on


Vanity sups on Contempt_, as _Poor Richard_ says.  And in another


Place, _Pride breakfasted with Plenty, dined with Poverty, and supped


with Infamy._ And after all, of what Use is this _Pride of


Appearance_, for which so much is risked, so much is suffered?  It


cannot promote Health, or ease Pain; it makes no Increase of Merit in


the Person, it creates Envy, it hastens Misfortune.





        _What is a Butterfly?  At best


        He's but a Caterpillar drest.


        The gaudy Fop's his Picture just,_





        as _Poor Richard_ says.





        But what Madness must it be to _run in Debt_ for these


Superfluities!  We are offered, by the Terms of this Vendue, _Six


Months Credit_; and that perhaps has induced some of us to attend it,


because we cannot spare the ready Money, and hope now to be fine


without it.  But, ah, think what you do when you run in Debt; _You


give to another Power over your Liberty._ If you cannot pay at the


Time, you will be ashamed to see your Creditor; you will be in Fear


when you speak to him; you will make poor pitiful sneaking Excuses,


and by Degrees come to lose your Veracity, and sink into base


downright lying; for, as _Poor Richard_ says, _The second Vice is


Lying, the first is running in Debt._ And again, to the same Purpose,


_Lying rides upon Debt's Back._ Whereas a freeborn _Englishman_ ought


not to be ashamed or afraid to see or speak to any Man living.  But


Poverty often deprives a Man of all Spirit and Virtue: _'Tis hard for


an empty Bag to stand upright_, as _Poor Richard_ truly says.  What


would you think of that Prince, or that Government, who should issue


an Edict forbidding you to dress like a Gentleman or a Gentlewoman,


on Pain of Imprisonment or Servitude?  Would you not say, that you


are free, have a Right to dress as you please, and that such an Edict


would be a Breach of your Privileges, and such a Government


tyrannical?  And yet you are about to put yourself under that Tyranny


when you run in Debt for such Dress!  Your Creditor has Authority at


his Pleasure to deprive you of your Liberty, by confining you in Goal


for Life, or to sell you for a Servant, if you should not be able to


pay him!  When you have got your Bargain, you may, perhaps, think


little of Payment; but _Creditors, Poor Richard_ tells us, _have


better Memories than Debtors_; and in another Place says, _Creditors


are a superstitious Sect, great Observers of set Days and Times._ The


Day comes round before you are aware, and the Demand is made before


you are prepared to satisfy it.  Or if you bear your Debt in Mind,


the Term which at first seemed so long, will, as it lessens, appear


extreamly short.  _Time_ will seem to have added Wings to his Heels


as well as Shoulders.  _Those have a short Lent,_ saith _Poor


Richard, _who owe Money to be paid at Easter._ Then since, as he


says, _The Borrower is a Slave to the Lender, and the Debtor to the


Creditor_, disdain the Chain, preserve your Freedom; and maintain


your Independency: Be _industrious_ and _free_; be _frugal_ and


_free._ At present, perhaps, you may think yourself in thriving


Circumstances, and that you can bear a little Extravagance without


Injury; but,





        _For Age and Want, save while you may;


        No Morning Sun lasts a whole Day,_





        as _Poor Richard_ says. -- Gain may be temporary and uncertain,


but ever while you live, Expence is constant and certain; and _'tis


easier to build two Chimnies than to keep one in Fuel_, as _Poor


Richard_ says.  So _rather go to Bed supperless than rise in Debt.





        _Get what you can, and what you get hold;


        Tis the Stone that will turn all your Lead into Gold,_





        as _Poor Richard_ says.  And when you have got the


Philosopher's Stone, sure you will no longer complain of bad Times,


or the Difficulty of paying Taxes.





        This Doctrine, my Friends, is _Reason_ and _Wisdom_; but after


all, do not depend too much upon your own _Industry_, and


_Frugality_, and _Prudence_, though excellent Things, for they may


all be blasted without the Blessing of Heaven; and therefore ask that


Blessing humbly, and be not uncharitable to those that at present


seem to want it, but comfort and help them.  Remember _Job_ suffered,


and was afterwards prosperous.





        And now to conclude, _Experience keeps a dear School, but Fools


will learn in no other, and scarce in that_; for it is true, _we may


give Advice, but we cannot give Conduct_, as _Poor Richard_ says:


However, remember this, _They that won't be counselled, can't be


helped_, as _Poor Richard_ says: And farther, That _if you will not


hear Reason, she'll surely rap your Knuckles._"





        Thus the old Gentleman ended his Harangue.  The People heard


it, and approved the Doctrine, and immediately practised the


contrary, just as if it had been a common Sermon; for the Vendue


opened, and they began to buy extravagantly, notwithstanding all his


Cautions, and their own Fear of Taxes. -- I found the good Man had


thoroughly studied my Almanacks, and digested all I had dropt on


those Topicks during the Course of Five-and-twenty Years.  The


frequent Mention he made of me must have tired any one else, but my


Vanity was wonderfully delighted with it, though I was conscious that


not a tenth Part of the Wisdom was my own which he ascribed to me,


but rather the _Gleanings_ I had made of the Sense of all Ages and


Nations.  However, I resolved to be the better for the Echo of it;


and though I had at first determined to buy Stuff for a new Coat, I


went away resolved to wear my old One a little longer.  _Reader_, if


thou wilt do the same, thy Profit will be as great as mine.


                                 _I am, as ever,


                                         Thine to serve thee,_

        _Poor Richard_


        1743





        _Friendly READER,_


        Because I would have every Man make Advantage of the Blessings


of Providence, and few are acquainted with the Method of making Wine


of the Grapes which grow wild in our Woods, I do here present them


with a few easy Directions, drawn from some Years Experience, which,


if they will follow, they may furnish themselves with a wholesome


sprightly Claret, which will keep for several Years, and is not


inferior to that which passeth for _French_ Claret.





        Begin to gather Grapes from the 10th of _September_ (the ripest


first) to the last of _October_, and having clear'd them of Spider


webs, and dead Leaves, put them into a large Molosses- or


Rum-Hogshead; after having washed it well, and knock'd one Head out,


fix it upon the other Head, on a Stand, or Blocks in the Cellar, if


you have any, if not, in the warmest Part of the House, about 2 Feet


from the Ground; as the Grapes sink, put up more, for 3 or 4 Days;


after which, get into the Hogshead bare-leg'd, and tread them down


until the Juice works up about your Legs, which will be in less than


half an Hour; then get out, and turn the Bottom ones up, and tread


them again, a Quarter of an Hour; this will be sufficient to get out


the good Juice; more pressing wou'd burst the unripe Fruit, and give


it an ill Taste: This done, cover the Hogshead close with a thick


Blanket, and if you have no Cellar, and the Weather proves Cold, with


two.





        In this Manner you must let it take its first Ferment, for 4 or


5 Days it will work furiously; when the Ferment abates, which you


will know by its making less Noise, make a Spile-hole within six


Inches of the Bottom, and twice a Day draw some in a Glass.  When it


looks as clear as Rock-water, draw it off into a clean, rather than


new Cask, proportioning it to the Contents of the Hogshead or Wine


(*1) Vat; that is, if the Hogshead holds twenty Bushels of Grapes,


Stems and all, the Cask must at least, hold 20 Gallons, for they will


yield a Gallon per Bushel.  Your Juice or (*2) Must thus drawn from


the Vat, proceed to the second Ferment.





(*1) Vat _or_ Fatt, _a Name for the Vessel, in which you tread the


Grapes, and in which the_ Must _takes its first Ferment._





(*2) Must _is a Name for the Juice of the Vine before it is


fermented, afterwards 'tis called Wine._














        You must reserve in Jugs or Bottles, 1 Gallon or 5 Quarts of


the Must to every 20 Gallons you have to work; which you will use


according to the following Directions.





        Place your Cask, which must be chock full, with the Bung up,


and open twice every Day, Morning and Night; feed your Cask with the


reserved Must; two Spoonfuls at a time will suffice, clearing the


Bung after you feed it, with your Finger or a Spoon, of the


Grape-Stones and other Filth which the Ferment will throw up; you


must continue feeding it thus until _Christmas_, when you may bung it


up, and it will be fit for Use or to be rack'd into clean Casks or


Bottles, by _February._





        _N. B._ Gather the Grapes after the Dew is off, and in all dry


Seasons.  Let not the Children come at the Must, it will scour them


severely.  If you make Wine for Sale, or to go beyond Sea, one


quarter Part must be distill'd, and the Brandy put into the three


Quarters remaining.  One Bushel of Grapes, heap Measure, as you


gather them from the Vine, will make at least a Gallon of Wine, if


good, five Quarts.





        These Directions are not design'd for those who are skill'd in


making Wine, but for those who have hitherto had no Acquaintance with


that Art.


                                 ______

        Many a long dispute among Divines may be thus abridg'd, It is


so: It is not so.  It is so; It is not so.





        Experience keeps a dear school, yet Fools will learn in no


other.





        Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.





        How many observe Christ's Birth-day!  How few, his Precepts!


O! 'tis easier to keep Holidays than Commandments.

        _Poor Richard_


        1742





        _Courteous READER,_


        This is the ninth Year of my Endeavours to serve thee in the


Capacity of a Calendar-Writer.  The Encouragement I have met with


must be ascrib'd, in a great Measure, to your Charity, excited by the


open honest Declaration I made of my Poverty at my first Appearance.


This my Brother _Philomaths_ could, without being Conjurers,


discover; and _Poor Richard_'s Success, has produced ye a _Poor


Will_, and a _Poor Robin_; and no doubt _Poor John_, &c. will follow,


and we shall all be _in Name_ what some Folks say we are already _in


Fact_, A Parcel of _poor Almanack Makers._ During the Course of these


nine Years, what Buffetings have I not sustained!  The Fraternity


have been all in Arms.  Honest _Titan_, deceas'd, was rais'd, and


made to abuse his old Friend.  Both Authors and Printers were angry.


Hard Names, and many, were bestow'd on me.  They deny'd me to be the


Author of my own Works; declar'd there never was any such Person;


asserted that I was dead 60 Years ago; prognosticated my Death to


happen within a Twelvemonth: with many other malicious


Inconsistences, the Effects of blind Passion, Envy at my Success; and


a vain Hope of depriving me (dear Reader) of thy wonted Countenance


and Favour. -- _Who knows him?_ they cry: _Where does he live?_ --


But what is that to them?  If I delight in a private Life, have they


any Right to drag me out of my Retirement?  I have good Reasons for


concealing the Place of my Abode.  'Tis time for an old Man, as I am,


to think of preparing for his great Remove.  The perpetual Teasing of


both Neighbours and Strangers, to calculate Nativities, give


Judgments on Schemes, erect Figures, discover Thieves, detect


Horse-Stealers, describe the Route of Run-aways and stray'd Cattle;


The Croud of Visitors with a 1000 trifling Questions; _Will my Ship


return safe?  Will my Mare win the Race?  Will her next Colt be a


Pacer?  When will my Wife die?  Who shall be my Husband, and HOW LONG


_first?_ _When is the best time to cut Hair, trim Cocks, or sow


Sallad?_ These and the like Impertinences I have now neither Taste


nor Leisure for.  I have had enough of 'em.  All that these angry


Folks can say, will never provoke me to tell them where I live.  I


would eat my Nails first.





        My last Adversary is _J. J ------ n_, Philomat. who _declares


and protests_ (in his Preface, 1741) that the _false Prophecy put in


my Almanack, concerning him, the Year before, is altogether_ false


and untrue: _and that I am one of Baal's false Prophets._ This


_false, false Prophecy_ he speaks of, related to his Reconciliation


with the Church of _Rome_; which, notwithstanding his Declaring and


Protesting, is, I fear, too true.  Two Things in his elegiac Verses


confirm me in this Suspicion.  He calls the First of _November_ by


the Name of _All Hallows Day._ Reader; does not this smell of Popery?


Does it in the least savour of the pure Language of Friends?  But the


plainest Thing is; his Adoration of Saints, which he confesses to be


his Practice, in these Words, page 4.





                 _When any Trouble did me befal,


                 To my dear_ Mary _then I would call:_





        Did he think the whole World were so stupid as not to take


Notice of this?  So ignorant as not to know, that all Catholicks pay


the highest Regard to the _Virgin-Mary_?  Ah!  Friend _John_, We must


allow you to be a Poet, but you are certainly no Protestant.  I could


heartily wish your Religion were as good as your Verses.


                                         _RICHARD SAUNDERS._


                                 ______





        Strange! that a Man who has wit enough to write a Satyr; should


have folly enough to publish it.





        He that hath a Trade, hath an Estate.





        Have you somewhat to do to-morrow; do it to-day.





        No workman without tools,


        Nor Lawyer without Fools,


        Can live by their Rules.





        The painful Preacher, like a candle bright,


        Consumes himself in giving others Light.





 


        Speak and speed: the close mouth catches no flies.





        Visit your Aunt, but not every Day; and call at your Brother's,


but not every night.





        Bis dat, qui cito dat.





        Money and good Manners make the Gentleman.





        Late Children, early Orphans.





        _Ben_ beats his Pate, and fancys wit will come;


        But he may knock, there's no body at home.





        The good Spinner hath a large Shift.





        _Tom_, vain's your Pains; They all will fail:


        Ne'er was good Arrow made of a Sow's Tail.





        Empty Free-booters, cover'd with Scorn:


        They went out for Wealth, & come ragged and torn,


        As the Ram went for Wool, and was sent back shorn.





        Ill Customs & bad Advice are seldom forgotten.





        He that sows thorns, should not go barefoot.





        Reniego de grillos, aunque sean d'oro.





        Men meet, mountains never.





        When Knaves fall out, honest Men get their goods: When Priests


dispute, we come at the Truth.





        _Kate_ would have _Thomas_, no one blame her can:


        _Tom_ won't have _Kate_, and who can blame the Man?





        A large train makes a light Purse.





        Death takes no bribes.





        One good Husband is worth two good Wives; for the scarcer


things are the more they're valued.





        He that riseth late, must trot all day, and shall scarce


overtake his business at night.





        He that speaks ill of the Mare, will buy her.








        You may drive a gift without a gimblet.





        Eat few Suppers, and you'll need few Medicines.





        You will be careful, if you are wise;


        How you touch Men's Religion, or Credit, or Eyes.





        After Fish,


        Milk do not wish.





        xxx


        Heb Dduw heb ddim, a Duw a digon.





        They who have nothing to trouble them, will be troubled at


nothing.





        Against Diseases here, the strongest Fence,


        Is the defensive Virtue, Abstinence.





        Fient de chien, & marc d'argent,


        Seront tout un au jour du jugement.





        If thou dost ill, the joy fades, not the pains;


        If well, the pain doth fade, the joy remains.





        To err is human, to repent divine, to persist devilish.





        Money & Man a mutual Friendship show:


        Man makes _false_ Money, Money makes Man so.





        Industry pays Debts, Despair encreases them.





        Bright as the day and as the morning fair,


        Such _Cloe_ is, & common as the air.





        Here comes _Glib-tongue_: who can out-flatter a Dedication; and


lie, like ten Epitaphs.





        _Hope_ and a Red-Rag, are Baits for Men and Mackrel.





        With the old Almanack and the old Year,


        Leave thy old Vices, tho' ever so dear.


------------------------------------------------------------








        _Rules of Health and long Life, and to preserve from


        Malignant Fevers, and Sickness in general._





        Eat and drink such an exact Quantity as the Constitution of thy


Body allows of, in reference to the Services of the Mind.








        They that study much, ought not to eat so much as those that


work hard, their Digestion being not so good.





        The exact Quantity and Quality being found out, is to be kept


to constantly.





        Excess in all other Things whatever, as well as in Meat and


Drink, is also to be avoided.





        Youth, Age, and Sick require a different Quantity.





        And so do those of contrary Complexions; for that which is too


much for a flegmatick Man, is not sufficient for a Cholerick.





        The Measure of Food ought to be (as much as possibly may be)


exactly proportionable to the Quality and Condition of the Stomach,


because the Stomach digests it.





        That Quantity that is sufficient, the Stomach can perfectly


concoct and digest, and it sufficeth the due Nourishment of the Body.





        A greater Quantity of some things may be eaten than of others,


some being of lighter Digestion than others.





        The Difficulty lies, in finding out an exact Measure; but eat


for Necessity, not Pleasure, for Lust knows not where Necessity ends.





        Wouldst thou enjoy a long Life, a healthy Body, and a vigorous


Mind, and be acquainted also with the wonderful Works of God? labour


in the first place to bring thy Appetite into Subjection to Reason.


-------------------------------------------------------------------





          _Rules to find out a fit Measure of Meat and Drink._





        If thou eatest so much as makes thee unfit for Study, or other


Business, thou exceedest the due Measure.





        If thou art dull and heavy after Meat, it's a sign thou hast


exceeded the due Measure; for Meat and Drink ought to refresh the


Body, and make it chearful, and not to dull and oppress it.





        If thou findest these ill Symptoms, consider whether too much


Meat, or too much Drink occasions it, or both, and abate by little


and little, till thou findest the Inconveniency removed.





        Keep out of the Sight of Feasts and Banquets as much as may be;


for 'tis more difficult to refrain good Cheer, when it's present,


than from the Desire of it when it is away; the like you may observe


in the Objects of all the other Senses.





        If a Man casually exceeds, let him fast the next Meal, and all


may be well again, provided it be not too often done; as if he exceed


at Dinner, let him refrain a Supper, _&c._





        A temperate Diet frees from Diseases; such are seldom ill, but


if they are surprised with Sickness, they bear it better, and recover


sooner; for most Distempers have their Original from Repletion.





        Use now and then a little Exercise a quarter of an Hour before


Meals, as to swing a Weight, or swing your Arms about with a small


Weight in each Hand; to leap, or the like, for that stirs the Muscles


of the Breast.





        A temperate Diet arms the Body against all external Accidents;


so that they are not so easily hurt by Heat, Cold or Labour; if they


at any time should be prejudiced, they are more easily cured, either


of Wounds, Dislocations or Bruises.





        But when malignant Fevers are rife in the Country or City where


thou dwelst, 'tis adviseable to eat and drink more freely, by Way of


Prevention; for those are Diseases that are not caused by Repletion,


and seldom attack Full-feeders.





        A sober Diet makes a Man die without Pain; it maintains the


Senses in Vigour; it mitigates the Violence of Passions and


Affections.





        It preserves the Memory, it helps the Understanding, it allays


the Heat of Lust; it brings a Man to a Consideration of his latter


End; it makes the Body a fit Tabernacle for the Lord to dwell in;


which makes us happy in this World, and eternally happy in the World


to come, through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour.

        _Poor Richard_


        1746





        _PREFACE._





        Who is _Poor Richard_?  People oft enquire,


        Where lives?  What is he? -- never yet the nigher.


        Somewhat to ease your Curiositie,


        Take these slight Sketches of my Dame and me.


        Thanks to kind Readers and a careful Wife,


        With Plenty bless'd, I lead an easy Life;


        My Business Writing; hers to drain the Mead,


        Or crown the barren Hill with useful Shade;


        In the smooth Glebe to see the Plowshare worn,


        And fill the Granary with needful Corn.


        Press nectarous Cyder from my loaded Trees,


        Print the sweet Butter, turn the drying Cheese.


        Some Books we read, tho' few there are that hit


        The happy Point where Wisdom joins with Wit;


        That set fair Virtue naked to our View,


        And teach us what is _decent_, what is _true._


        The Friend sincere, and honest Man, with Joy


        Treating or treated oft our Time employ.


        Our Table neat, Meals temperate; and our Door


        Op'ning spontaneous to the bashful Poor.


        Free from the bitter Rage of Party Zeal,


        All those we love who seek the publick Weal.


        Nor blindly follow Superstition's Lore,


        Which cheats deluded Mankind o'er and o'er.


        Not over righteous, quite beyond the Rule,


        Conscience perplext by every canting Tool.


        Nor yet when Folly hides the dubious Line,


        Where Good and Bad their blended Colours join;


        Rush indiscreetly down the dangerous Steep,


        And plunge uncertain in the darksome Deep.


        Cautious, if right; if wrong resolv'd to part


        The Inmate Snake that folds about the Heart.


        Observe the _Mean_, the _Motive_ and the _End_;


        Mending our selves, or striving still to mend.


        Our Souls sincere, our Purpose fair and free,


        Without Vain Glory or Hypocrisy:


        Thankful if well; if ill, we kiss the Rod;


        Resign with Hope, and put our Trust in GOD.


                                 ______





        When the Well's dry, we know the Worth of Water.


 


        He that whines for Glass without G


        Take away L and that's he.





        A good Wife & Health,


        is a Man's best Wealth.





        A quarrelsome Man has no good Neighbours.


 


        Wide will wear,


        but Narrow will tear.





        Silks and Sattins put out the Kitchen Fire.











        Vice knows she's ugly, so puts on her Mask.





        It's the easiest Thing in the World for a Man to deceive


himself.





        Women & Wine, Game & Deceit,


        Make the Wealth small and the Wants great.


 


        All Mankind are beholden to him that is kind to the Good.


 


        A Plowman on his Legs is higher than a Gentleman on his Knees.


 


        Virtue and Happiness are Mother and Daughter.


 


        The generous Mind least regards money, and yet most feels the


        Want of it.


 


        For one poor Man there are an hundred indigent.


 


        Dost thou love Life? then do not squander Time; for that's the


Stuff Life is made of.


 


        Good Sense is a Thing all need, few have, and none think they want.


 


        What's proper, is becoming: See the Blacksmith with his white


Silk Apron!


 


        The Tongue is ever turning to the aching Tooth.


 


        Want of Care does us more Damage than Want of Knowledge.





        Take Courage, Mortal; Death can't banish thee out of the Universe.





        The Sting of a Reproach, is the Truth of it.





        Do me the Favour to deny me at once.





        The most exquisite Folly is made of Wisdom spun too fine.





        A life of leisure, and a life of laziness, are two things.





        Mad Kings and mad Bulls, are not to be held by treaties & packthread.








        Changing Countries or Beds, cures neither a bad Manager, nor a Fever.





        A true great Man will neither trample on a Worm, nor sneak to an


Emperor.





        xxx


        Ni ffyddra llaw dyn, er gwneithr da idd ei hun.





        _Tim_ and his Handsaw are good in their Place,


        Tho' not fit for preaching or shaving a face.





        Half-Hospitality opens his Doors and shuts up his Countenance.

        _Poor Richard_


        1747





        _Courteous Reader,_


        This is the 15th Time I have entertain'd thee with my annual


Productions; I hope to thy Profit as well as mine.  For besides the


astronomical Calculations, and other Things usually contain'd in


Almanacks, which have their daily Use indeed while the Year


continues, but then become of no Value, I have constantly


interspers'd _moral_ Sentences, _prudent_ Maxims, and _wise_ Sayings,


many of them containing _much good Sense_ in _very few_ Words, and


therefore apt to leave _strong_ and _lasting_ Impressions on the


Memory of young Persons, whereby they may receive Benefit as long as


they live, when both Almanack and Almanack-maker have been long


thrown by and forgotten.  If I now and then insert a Joke or two,


that seem to have little in them, my Apology is, that such may have


their Use, since perhaps for their Sake light airy Minds peruse the


rest, and so are struck by somewhat of more Weight and Moment.  The


Verses on the Heads of the Months are also generally design'd to have


the same Tendency.  I need not tell thee that not many of them are of


my own Making.  If thou hast any Judgment in Poetry, thou wilt easily


discern the Workman from the Bungler.  I know as well as thee, that I


am no _Poet born_; and it is a Trade I never learnt, nor indeed could


learn.  _If I make Verses, 'tis in Spight -- Of Nature and my Stars,


I_ _write._ Why then should I give my Readers _bad Lines_ of my own,


when _good Ones_ of other People's are so plenty?  'Tis methinks a


poor Excuse for the bad Entertainment of Guests, that the Food we set


before them, tho' coarse and ordinary, is _of one's own Raising, off


one's own Plantation,_ &c. when there is Plenty of what is ten times


better, to be had in the Market. -- On the contrary, I assure ye, my


Friends, that I have procur'd the best I could for ye, and _much Good


may't do ye._





        I cannot omit this Opportunity of making honourable Mention of


the late deceased Ornament and Head of our Profession, Mr. JACOB


TAYLOR, who for upwards of 40 Years (with some few Intermissions


only) supply'd the good People of this and the neighbouring Colonies,


with the most compleat Ephemeris and most accurate Calculations that


have hitherto appear'd in _America._ -- He was an ingenious


Mathematician, as well as an expert and skilful Astronomer; and


moreover, no mean Philosopher, but what is more than all, He was a


PIOUS and an HONEST Man.  _Requiescat in pace._


                                 _I am thy poor Friend, to serve thee,_


                                         R. SAUNDERS.


                                 ______





        Strive to be the _greatest_ Man in your Country, and you may be


disappointed; Strive to be the _best_, and you may succeed: He may


well win the race that runs by himself.





        Tis a strange Forest that has no rotten Wood in't.


        And a strange Kindred that all are good in't.





        None know the unfortunate, and the fortunate do not know


themselves.





        There's a time to wink as well as to see.





        Honest _Tom_! you may trust him with a house-full of untold


Milstones.





        There is no Man so bad, but he secretly respects the Good.





        When there's more Malice shown than Matter:


        On the Writer falls the satyr.





        _Courage_ would fight, but _Discretion_ won't let him.





        Delicate _Dick_! whisper'd the Proclamation.





        _Cornelius_ ought to be _Tacitus._





        _Pride_ and the _Gout_,


        are seldom cur'd throughout.





        We are not so sensible of the greatest Health as of the least


Sickness.





        A good Example is the best sermon.





        A Father's a Treasure; a Brother's a Comfort; a Friend is both.





        Despair ruins some, Presumption many.





        A quiet Conscience sleeps in Thunder,


        but Rest and Guilt live far asunder.





        He that won't be counsell'd, can't be help'd.





        _Craft_ must be at charge for clothes, but _Truth_ can go


naked.





        Write Injuries in Dust, Benefits in Marble.





        What is Serving God?  'Tis doing Good to Man.





        What maintains one Vice would bring up two Children.





        Many have been ruin'd by buying good pennyworths.





        Better is a little with content than much with contention.





        A Slip of the Foot you may soon recover:


        But a Slip of the Tongue you may never get over.





        What signifies your Patience, if you can't find it when you


want it.





        d. wise, l. foolish.





        _Time enough_, always proves _little enough._





        It is wise not to seek a Secret, and Honest not to reveal it.





        A Mob's a Monster; Heads enough, but no Brains.





        The Devil sweetens Poison with Honey.





        He that cannot bear with other People's Passions, cannot govern


his own.





        He that by the Plow would thrive,


        himself must either hold or drive.

        _Poor Richard Improved_


        1748





        _Kind Reader,_


        The favourable Reception my annual Labours have met with from


the Publick these 15 Years past, has engaged me in Gratitude to


endeavour some Improvement of my Almanack.  And since my Friend


_Taylor_ is no more, whose _Ephemerides_ so long and so agreeably


serv'd and entertain'd these Provinces, I have taken the Liberty to


imitate his well-known Method, and give two Pages for each Month;


which affords me Room for several valuable Additions, as will best


appear on Inspection and Comparison with former Almanacks. Yet I have


not so far follow'd his Method, as not to continue my own where I


thought it preferable; and thus my Book is increas'd to a Size beyond


his, and contains much more Matter.





        Hail Night serene! thro' Thee where'er we turn


        Our wond'ring Eyes, Heav'n's Lamps profusely burn;


        And Stars unnumber'd all the Sky adorn.


        But lo! -- what's that I see appear?


        It seems far off a pointed flame;


        From Earthwards too the shining Meteor came:


        How swift it climbs th' etherial Space!


        And now it traverses each Sphere,


        And seems some knowing Mind, familiar to the Place.


        Dame, hand my Glass, the longest, strait prepare; --


        'Tis He -- 'tis TAYLOR's Soul, that travels there.


        O stay! thou happy Spirit, stay,


        And lead me on thro' all th' unbeaten Wilds of Day;


        Where Planets in pure Streams of Ether driven,


        Swim thro' the blue Expanse of Heav'n.


        There let me, thy Companion, stray


        From Orb to Orb, and now behold


        Unnumber'd Suns, all Seas of molten Gold,


        And trace each Comet's wandring Way. ------





        Souse down into Prose again, my Muse; for Poetry's no more thy


Element, than Air is that of the Flying-Fish; whose Flights, like


thine, are therefore always short and heavy. ------





        We complain sometimes of hard Winters in this Country; but our


Winters will appear as Summers, when compar'd with those that some of


our Countrymen undergo in the most Northern _British_ Colony on this


Continent, which is that upon _Churchill_ River, in _Hudson's Bay_,


Lat. 58d. 56m. Long. from _London_ 94d. 50m. West. Captain


_Middleton_, a Member of the _Royal Society_, who had made many


Voyages thither, and winter'd there 1741 -- 2, when he was in Search


of the _North-West_ Passage to the _South-Sea_, gives an Account of


it to that Society, from which I have extracted these Particulars,


_viz._





        The Hares, Rabbits, Foxes, and Partridges, in _September_ and


the Beginning of _October_, change their Colour to a snowy White, and


continue white till the following Spring.





        The Lakes and standing Waters, which are not above 10 or 12


Feet deep, are frozen to the Ground in Winter, and the Fishes therein


all perish.  Yet in Rivers near the Sea, and Lakes of a greater Depth


than 10 or 12 Feet, Fishes are caught all the Winter, by cutting


Holes thro' the Ice, and therein putting Lines and Hooks.  As soon as


the Fish are brought into the open Air, they instantly freeze stiff.





        Beef, Pork, Mutton, and Venison, kill'd in the Beginning of the


Winter, are preserved by the Frost for 6 or 7 Months, entirely free


from Putrefaction.  Likewise Geese, Partridges, and other Fowls,


kill'd at the same Time, and kept with their Feathers on and Guts in,


are preserv'd by the Frost, and prove good Eating.  All Kinds of Fish


are preserv'd in the same Manner.





        In large Lakes and Rivers, the Ice is sometimes broken by


imprison'd Vapours; and the Rocks, Trees, Joists, and Rafters of our


Buildings, are burst with a Noise not less terrible than the firing


of many Guns together.  The Rocks which are split by the Frost, are


heaved up in great Heaps, leaving large Cavities behind.  If Beer or


Water be left even in Copper Pots by the Bed-side, the Pots will be


split before Morning.  Bottles of strong Beer, Brandy, strong Brine,


Spirits of Wine, set out in the open Air for 3 or 4 Hours, freeze to


solid Ice.  The Frost is never out of the Ground, how deep is not


certain; but on digging 10 or 12 Feet down in the two Summer Months,


it has been found hard frozen.





        All the Water they use for Cooking, Brewing, _&c._ is melted


Snow and Ice; no Spring is yet found free from freezing, tho' dug


ever so deep down. -- All Waters inland, are frozen fast by the


Beginning of _October_, and continue so to the Middle of _May._





        The Walls of the Houses are of Stone, two Feet thick; the


Windows very small, with thick wooden Shutters, which are close shut


18 Hours every Day in Winter.  In the Cellars they put their Wines,


Brandies, _&c._ Four large Fires are made every Day, in great Stoves


to warm the Rooms: As soon as the Wood is burnt down to a Coal, the


Tops of the Chimnies are close stopped, with an Iron Cover; this


keeps the Heat in, but almost stifles the People.  And


notwithstanding this, in 4 or 5 Hours after the Fire is out, the


Inside of the Walls and Bed-places will be 2 or 3 Inches thick with


Ice, which is every Morning cut away with a Hatchet.  Three or four


Times a Day, Iron Shot, of 24 Pounds Weight, are made red hot, and


hung up in the Windows of their Apartments, to moderate the Air that


comes in at Crevices; yet this, with a Fire kept burning the greatest


Part of 24 Hours, will not prevent Beer, Wine, Ink, _&c._ from


Freezing.





        For their Winter Dress, a Man makes use of three Pair of Socks,


of coarse Blanketting, or Duffeld, for the Feet, with a Pair of


Deerskin Shoes over them; two Pair of thick _English_ Stockings, and


a Pair of Cloth Stockings upon them; Breeches lined with Flannel; two


or three _English_ Jackets, and a Fur, or Leather Gown over them; a


large Beaver Cap, double, to come over the Face and Shoulders, and a


Cloth of Blanketting under the Chin; with Yarn Gloves, and a large


Pair of Beaver Mittins, hanging down from the Shoulders before, to


put the Hands in, reaching up as high as the Elbows.  Yet


notwithstanding this warm Clothing, those that stir Abroad when any


Wind blows from the Northward, are sometimes dreadfully frozen; some


have their Hands, Arms, and Face blistered and froze in a terrible


Manner, the Skin coming off soon after they enter a warm House, and


some lose their Toes.  And keeping House, or lying-in for the Cure of


these Disorders, brings on the Scurvy, which many die of, and few are


free from; nothing preventing it but Exercise and stirring Abroad.





        The Fogs and Mists, brought by northerly Winds in Winter,


appear visible to the naked Eye to be Icicles innumerable, as small


as fine Hairs, and pointed as sharp as Needles.  These Icicles lodge


in their Clothes, and if their Faces and Hands are uncover'd,


presently raise Blisters as white as a Linnen Cloth, and as hard as


Horn.  Yet if they immediately turn their Back to the Weather, and


can bear a Hand out of the Mitten, and with it rub the blister'd Part


for a small Time, they sometimes bring the Skin to its former State;


if not, they make the best of their Way to a Fire, bathe the Part in


hot Water, and thereby dissipate the Humours raised by the frozen


Air; otherwise the Skin wou'd be off in a short Time, with much hot,


serous, watry Matter, coming from under along with the Skin; and this


happens to some almost every Time they go Abroad, for 5 or 6 Months


in the Winter, so extreme cold is the Air, when the Wind blows any


Thing strong. -- Thus far Captain _Middleton._ And now, my tender


Reader, thou that shudderest when the Wind blows a little at N-West,


and criest, _'Tis extrrrrrream cohohold!  'Tis terrrrrrible cohold!_

        On the 19th of this Month, _Anno_ 1493, was born the famous


Astronomer _Copernicus_, to whom we owe the Invention, or rather the


Revival (it being taught by _Pythagoras_ near 2000 Years before) of


that now generally receiv'd System of the World which bears his Name,


and supposes the Sun in the Center, this Earth a Planet revolving


round it in 365 Days, 6 Hours, _&c._ and that Day and Night are


caused by the Turning of the Earth on its own Axis once round in 24


h. _&c._ The _Ptolomean_ System, which prevail'd before _Copernicus_,


suppos'd the Earth to be fix'd, and that the Sun went round it daily.


Mr. _Whiston_, a modern Astronomer, says, the Sun is 230,000 times


bigger than the Earth, and 81 Millions of Miles distant from it: That


vast Body must then have mov'd more than 480 Millions of Miles in 24


h. A prodigious Journey round this little Spot!  How much more


natural is _Copernicus_'s Scheme! -- _Ptolomy_ is compar'd to a


whimsical Cook, who, instead of Turning his Meat in Roasting, should


fix That, and contrive to have his whole Fire, Kitchen and all,


whirling continually round it.

he soon descended from that lofty station, and became a private man,


living, unmolested, to a good old age; for he died not till about the

great changes in government, and violent struggles for that, which,

        _Poor Richard_


        1745





        _Courteous Reader_,


        For the Benefit of the Publick, and my own Profit, I have


performed this my thirteenth annual Labour, which I hope will be as


acceptable as the former.





        The rising and setting of the Planets, and their Conjunctions


with the Moon, I have continued; whereby those who are unacquainted


with those heavenly Bodies, may soon learn to distinguish them from


the fixed Stars, by observing the following Directions.





        All those glittering Stars (except five) which we see in the


Firmament of Heaven, are called fixed Stars, because they keep the


same Distance from one another, and from the Ecliptic; they rise and


set on the same Points of the Horizon, and appear like so many lucid


Points fixed to the celestial Firmament.  The other five have a


particular and different Motion, for which Reason they have not


always the same Distance form one another; and therefore they have


been called wandering Stars or Planets, _viz. Saturn_ xxx, _Jupiter_


xxx, _Mars_ xxx, _Venus_ xxx, and _Mercury_ xxx, and these may be


distinguished from the fixed Stars by their not twinkling.  The


brightest of the five is _Venus_, which appears the biggest; and when


this glorious Star appears, and goes before the Sun, it is called


_Phosphorus_, or the Morning-Star, and _Hesperus_, or the


Evening-Star, when it follows the Sun.  _Jupiter_ appears almost as


big as _Venus_, but not so bright.  _Mars_ may be easily known from


the rest of the Planets, because it appears red like a hot Iron or


burning Coal, and twinkles a little.  _Saturn_, in Appearance, is


less than _Mars_, and of a pale Colour, _Mercury_ is so near the Sun,


that it is seldom seen.





        Against the 6th Day of _January_ you may see xxx rise 10 35,


which signifies the Planet _Mars_ rises 35 Minutes after 10 o' Clock


at Night, when that Planet may be seen to appear in the East.  Also


against the 10th Day of _January_ you will find xxx sets 7 13, which


shows _Venus_ sets 13 Minutes after 7 o'Clock at Night.  If you look


towards the West that Evening, you may see that beautiful Star till


the Time of its setting.  Again, on the 18th Day of the same Month,


you will find xxx rise 9 18, which shews that _Saturn_ rises 18


Minutes after 9 at Night.





        Or the Planets may be known by observing them at the Time of


their Conjunctions with the Moon, _viz._ against the 14 Day of


_January_ are inserted these Characters, xxx, which shews there will


be a Conjunction of the Moon and _Saturn_ on that Day.  If you look


out about 5 o' Clock in the Morning, you will see _Saturn_ very near


the Moon.  The like is to be observed at any other time by the rising


and setting of the Planets, and their Conjunctions with the Moon; by


which Method they may be distinctly known from the fixed Stars.





        I have nothing further to add at present, but my hearty Wishes


for your Welfare, both temporal and spiritual, and Thanks for all


your past Favours, being,

        _Poor Richard_


        1744





        _Courteous Reader,_


      This is the Twelfth Year that I have in this Way laboured for


the Benefit -- of Whom? -- of the Publick, if you'll be so


good-natured as to believe it; if not, e'en take the naked Truth,


'twas for the Benefit of my own dear self; not forgetting in the mean


time, our gracious Consort and Dutchess the peaceful, quiet, silent


Lady _Bridget._ But whether my Labours have been of any Service to


the Publick or not, the Publick I must acknowledge has been of


Service to me; I have lived Comfortably by its Benevolent


Encouragement; and I hope I shall always bear a grateful Sense of its


continued Favour.





        My Adversary _J -- n J ------ n_ has indeed made an Attempt to


_out-shine_ me, by pretending to penetrate _a Year deeper_ into


Futurity; and giving his Readers _gratis_ in his Almanack for 1743 an


Eclipse of the Year 1744, to be beforehand with me: His Words are,


"The first Day of _April_ next Year 1744, there will be a GREAT


ECLIPSE of the Sun; it begins about an Hour before Sunset.  It being


in the Sign Aries, the House of Mars, and in the 7th, shows Heat,


Difference and Animosities between Persons of the highest Rank and


Quality," _&c._ I am very glad, for the Sake of these Persons of Rank


and Quality, that there is _no manner of Truth_ in this Prediction:


They may, if they please, live in Love and Peace.  And I caution his


Readers (they are but few, indeed, and so the Matter's the less) not


to give themselves any Trouble about observing this imaginary Great


Eclipse; for they may stare till they're blind without seeing the


least Sign of it.  I might, on this Occasion, return Mr. _J ------ n_


the Name of _Baal_'s _false Prophet_ he gave me some Years ago in his


Wrath, on Account of my Predicting his Reconciliation with the


_Church of Rome_, (tho' he seems now to have given up that Point) but


I think such Language between old Men and Scholars unbecoming; and I


leave him to settle the Affair with the Buyers of his Almanack as


well as he can, who perhaps will not take it very kindly, that he has


done what in him lay (by sending them out to gaze at an invisible


Eclipse on the first of _April_) to make _April Fools_ of them all.


His old thread-bare Excuse which he repeats Year after Year about the


_Weather_, "That no Man can be infallible therein, by Reason of the


many contrary Causes happening at or near the same time, and the


Unconstancy of the Summer Showers and gusts," _&c._ will hardly serve


him in the Affair of _Eclipses_; and I know not where he'll get


another.





        I have made no Alteration in my usual Method, except adding the


Rising and Setting of the Planets, and the Lunar Conjunctions.  Those


who are so disposed, may thereby very readily learn to know the


Planets, and distinguish them from each other.

        On the 7th of this month 1692 died _Robert Boyle_, Esq; one of


the greatest philosophers the last age produced.  He first brought


the machine called an _Airpump_, into use; by which many of the


surprizing properties of that wonderful element were discovered and


demonstrated.  His knowledge of natural history, and skill in


chymistry, were very great and extensive; and his piety inferior to


neither.





                 ------ BOYLE, _whose pious search


                 Amid the dark recesses of his works


                 The great_ CREATOR _sought:_ ------ Thomson.





         is therefore an instance, that tho' _Ignorance_ may in some be the


_Mother of Devotion_, yet true learning and exalted piety are by no means


inconsistent.

        When we read in antient history of the speeches made by


generals to very numerous armies, we sometimes wonder how they could


be well heard; but supposing the men got together so close, that each


took up no more ground than two foot in breadth, and one in depth,


45000 might stand in a space that was but 100 yards square, and 21780


on a single acre of ground.  There are many voices that may be heard


at 100 yards distance.

        On the 18th of this month, _anno_ 1546 died that famous


reformer, LUTHER: who struck the great blow to papal tyranny in


_Europe._ He was remarkably _temperate_ in meat and drink, sometimes


fasting four days together; and at other times, for many days eating


only a little bread and a herring.  _Cicero_ says, _There was never


any_ great _man who was not an_ industrious _man_; to which may,


perhaps, be added, _There was never any_ industrious _man who was not


a_ temperate _man_: For intemperance in diet, abates the vigour and


dulls the action both of mind and body.

                                           OF SOUND.


        Mr. _Flamstead_, Dr. _Halley_ and Mr. _Derham_, agree that


sound moves 1142 feet in a second, which is one _English_ mile in 4


seconds and 5 8ths; that it moves in the same time in every different


state of the atmosphere; that winds hardly make any difference in its


velocity; that a languid or loud sound moves with the same velocity;


and that different kinds of sounds, as of bells, guns, &c. have the


same velocity, and are equally swift in the beginning as end of their


motion.

        The nose of a lady here, is not delighted with perfumes that


she understands are in _Arabia._ Fine musick in _China_ gives no


pleasure to the nicest ear in _Pennsilvania._ Nor does the most


exquisite dish serv'd up in _Japan_, regale a luxurious palate in any


other country.  But the benevolent mind of a virtuous man, is


pleas'd, when it is inform'd of good and generous actions, in what


part of the world soever they are done.

        On the 7th of this month, 1626, died that _great little_ man,


Sir FRANCIS BACON; _great_ in his prodigious genius, parts and


learning; and _little_, in his servile compliances with a _little_


court, and submissive flattery of a _little_ prince.  _Pope_


characterises him thus, in one strong line;





        _If Parts allure thee, think how_ BACON _shin'd,


        The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind._





        He is justly esteem'd the father of the modern experimental


philosophy.  And another poet treats him more favourably, ascribing


his blemishes to a wrong unfortunate choice of his way of Life;





        ------ BACON, hapless in his choice,


        Unfit to stand the civil storm of state,


        And thro' the smooth barbarity of courts,


        With firm, but pliant virtue, forward still


        To urge his course.  Him for the studious shade


        Kind nature form'd, deep, comprehensive, clear,


        Exact, and elegant; in one rich soul,


        PLATO, the STAGYRITE, and TULLY join'd.


        The great deliverer he! who from the gloom


        Of cloister'd monks, and jargon-teaching schools,


        Led forth the true Philosophy, there long


        Held in the magic chain of words and forms,


        And definitions void: He led her forth,


        Daughter of HEAV'N! that slow ascending still,


        Investigating sure the chain of things,


        With radiant finger points to HEAV'N again.





        If _Passion_ drives, let _Reason_ hold the Reins.

        On the 27th anno 1564, died at _Geneva_ that famous reformer,


Mr. _John Calvin_, A man of equal _temperance_ and _sobriety_ with


_Luther_, and perhaps yet greater _industry_.  His lectures were


yearly 186, his sermons yearly 286; he published besides every year


some great volume in folio; to which add his constant employments, in


governing the church, answering letters from all parts of the


reformed world, from pastors, concerning doubts, or asking ocunsel,


_&c. &c._ He ate little meat, and slept but very little; and as his


whole time was filled up with useful action, he may be said to have


_lived_ lon, tho' he died at _55_ years of age; since _sleep_ and


_sloth_ can hardly be called _living._

        It was wise counsel given to a young man, _Pitch upon that


course of life which is most excellent, and_ CUSTOM _will make it the


most delightful._ But many pitch on no course of life at all, nor


form any scheme of living, by which to attain any valuable end; but


wander perpetually from one thing to another.





        Hast thou not yet propos'd some certain end,


        To which thy life, thy every act may tend?


        Hast thou no mark at which to bend thy bow?

        With pellets and with stones, from tree to tree,


        A fruitless toil, and liv'st _extempore_?


        Watch the disease in time: For when, within


        The dropsy rages, and extends the skin,


        In vain for helebore the patient cries,


        And sees the doctor, but too late is wise:


        Too late for cure, he proffers half his wealth;


        Ten thousand doctors cannot give him health.


        Learn, wretches, learn the motions of the mind,


        Why you were mad, for what you were design'd,


        And the great _moral end_ of human kind.


        Study thy self; what rank or what degree,


        The wise creator has ordain'd for thee:


        And all the offices of that estate,


        Perform, and with thy prudence guide thy fate.

        PRIDE is said to be the _last_ vice the good man gets clear of.


'Tis a meer _Proteus_, and disguises itself under all manner of


appearances, putting on sometimes even the mask of _humility._ If


some are proud of neatness and propriety of dress; others are equally


so of despising it, and acting the perpetual sloven.

        On the 25th of this month, _anno_ 1642, was born the great Sir


ISAAC NEWTON, prince of the modern astronomers and philosophers.  But


what is all our little boasted knowledge, compar'd with that of the


angels?  If they see our actions, and are acquainted with our


affairs, our whole body of science must appear to them as little


better than ignorance; and the common herd of our learned men, scarce


worth their notice.  Now and then one of our very great philosophers,


an _Aristotle_, or a _Newton_, may, perhaps, by his most refined


speculations, afford them a little entertainment, as it seems a


mimicking of their own sublime amusements.  Hence _Pope_ says of the


latter,





                 _Superior beings, when of late they saw


                 A mortal man unfold all nature's law,


                 Admir'd such wisdom in a human shape,


                 And shew'd a_ Newton, _as we shew an ape._

        How to get RICHES.





        The Art of getting Riches consists very much in THRIFT.  All Men


are not equally qualified for getting Money, but it is in the Power


of every one alike to practise this Virtue.





        He that would be beforehand in the World, must be beforehand


with his Business: It is not only ill Management, but discovers a


slothful Disposition, to do that in the Afternoon, which should have


been done in the Morning.





        Useful Attainments in your Minority will procure Riches in


Maturity, of which Writing and Accounts are not the meanest.





        Learning, whether Speculative or Practical, is, in Popular or


Mixt Governments, the Natural Source of Wealth and Honour.





        PRECEPT I.


        In Things of moment, on thy self depend,


        Nor trust too far thy Servant or thy Friend:


        With private Views, thy Friend may promise fair,


        And Servants very seldom prove sincere.





        PRECEPT II.


        What can be done, with Care perform to Day,


        Dangers unthought-of will attend Delay;


        Your distant Prospects all precarious are,


        And Fortune is as fickle as she's fair.





        PRECEPT III.


        Nor trivial Loss, nor trivial Gain despise;


        Molehills, if often heap'd, to Mountains rise:


        Weigh every small Expence, and nothing waste,


        Farthings long sav'd, amount to Pounds at last.
