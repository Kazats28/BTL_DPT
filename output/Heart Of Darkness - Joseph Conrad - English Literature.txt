<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor with-



<P>out a flutter of the sails, and was at rest.&nbsp; The flood



<P>had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound



<P>down the river, the only thing for it was to come to



<P>and wait for the turn of the tide.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like



<P>the beginning of an interminable waterway.&nbsp; In the



<P>offing the sea and the sky were welded together without



<P>a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of



<P>the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand



<P>still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with



<P>gleams of varnished sprits.&nbsp; A haze rested on the low



<P>shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness.&nbsp; The



<P>air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still



<P>seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding mo-



<P>tionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Director of Companies was our captain and our



<P>host.&nbsp; We four affectionately watched his back as he



<P>stood in the bows looking to seaward.&nbsp; On the whole



<P>river there was nothing that looked half so nautical.&nbsp; He



<P>resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness



<P>personified.&nbsp; It was difficult to realize his work was not



<P>out there in the luminous estuary, but behind him, within



<P>the brooding gloom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Between us there was, as I have already said some-



<P>where, the bond of the sea.&nbsp; Besides holding our hearts



<P>together through long periods of separation, it had the



<P>effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarns--and



<P>even convictions.&nbsp; The Lawyer--the best of old fellows



<P>--had, because of his many years and many virtues, the



<P>only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug.



<P>The Accountant had brought out already a box of



<P>dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones.



<P>Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the



<P>mizzen-mast.&nbsp; He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complex-



<P>ion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and, with his



<P>arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled



<P>an idol.&nbsp; The Director, satisfied the anchor had good



<P>hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us.&nbsp; We



<P>exchanged a few words lazily.&nbsp; Afterwards there was



<P>silence on board the yacht.&nbsp; For some reason or other



<P>we did not begin that game of dominoes.&nbsp; We felt medi-



<P>tative, and fit for nothing but placid staring.&nbsp; The day



<P>was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance.



<P>The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck,



<P>was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very



<P>mist on the Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant



<P>fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping



<P>the low shores in diaphanous folds.&nbsp; Only the gloom to



<P>the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more



<P>somber every minute, as if angered by the approach



<P>of the sun.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the



<P>sun sank low, and from glowing white changed to a



<P>dull red without rays and without heat, as if about to



<P>go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that



<P>gloom brooding over a crowd of men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the



<P>serenity became less brilliant but more profound.&nbsp; The



<P>old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline



<P>of day, after ages of good service done to the race that



<P>peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of



<P>a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth.



<P>We looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush



<P>of a short day that comes and departs for ever, but in



<P>the august light of abiding memories.&nbsp; And indeed



<P>nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes,



<P>"followed the sea" with reverence and affection, than



<P>to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower



<P>reaches of the Thames.&nbsp; The tidal current runs to and



<P>fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories of



<P>men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the



<P>battles of the sea.&nbsp; It had known and served all the



<P>men of whom the nation is proud, from Sir Francis



<P>Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled and un-



<P>titled--the great knights-errant of the sea.&nbsp; It had



<P>borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing



<P>in the night of time, from the Golden Hind returning



<P>with her round flanks full of treasure, to be visited by



<P>the Queen's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic



<P>tale, to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other conquests



<P>--and that never returned.&nbsp; It had known the ships and



<P>the men.&nbsp; They had sailed from Deptford, from Green-



<P>wich, from Erith--the adventurers and the settlers;



<P>kings' ships and the ships of men on 'Change; captains,



<P>admirals, the dark "interlopers" of the Eastern trade,



<P>and the commissioned "generals" of East India fleets.



<P>Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all had gone



<P>out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the



<P>torch, messengers of the might within the land, bearers



<P>of a spark from the sacred fire.&nbsp; What greatness had



<P>not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of



<P>an unknown earth! . . .&nbsp; The dreams of men, the seed



<P>of commonwealths, the germs of empires.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights



<P>began to appear along the shore.&nbsp; The Chapman light-



<P>house, a three-legged thing erect on a mud-flat, shone



<P>strongly.&nbsp; Lights of ships moved in the fairway--a



<P>great stir of lights going up and going down.&nbsp; And



<P>farther west on the upper reaches the place of the mon-



<P>strous town was still marked ominously on the sky, a



<P>brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the



<P>stars.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And this also," said Marlow suddenly, "has been



<P>one of the dark places of the earth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was the only man of us who still "followed the



<P>sea."&nbsp; The worst that could be said of him was that



<P>he did not represent his class.&nbsp; He was a seaman, but he



<P>was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may



<P>so express it, a sedentary life.&nbsp; Their minds are of the



<P>stay-at-home order, and their home is always with them



<P>--the ship; and so is their country--the sea.&nbsp; One ship



<P>is very much like another, and the sea is always the same.



<P>In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign



<P>shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life,



<P>glide past, veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a



<P>slightly disdainful ignorance; for there is nothing mys-



<P>terious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself, which is



<P>the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny.



<P>For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or



<P>a casual spree on shore suffices to unfold for him the



<P>secret of a whole continent, and generally he finds the



<P>secret not worth knowing.&nbsp; The yarns of seamen have a



<P>direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within



<P>the shell of a cracked nut.&nbsp; But Marlow was not typical



<P>(if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted), and to



<P>him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a



<P>kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it



<P>out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of



<P>one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible



<P>by the spectral illumination of moonshine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His remark did not seem at all surprising.&nbsp; It was



<P>just like Marlow.&nbsp; It was accepted in silence.&nbsp; No one



<P>took the trouble to grunt even; and presently he said,



<P>very slow--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was thinking of very old times, when the Romans



<P>first came here, nineteen hundred years ago--the other



<P>day. . . .&nbsp; Light came out of this river since--you



<P>say Knights?&nbsp; Yes; but it is like a running blaze on a



<P>plain, like a flash of lightning in the clouds.&nbsp; We live



<P>in the flicker--may it last as long as the old earth keeps



<P>rolling!&nbsp; But darkness was here yesterday.&nbsp; Imagine



<P>the feelings of a commander of a fine--what d'ye call



<P>'em?--trireme in the Mediterranean, ordered suddenly



<P>to the north; run overland across the Gauls in a hurry;



<P>put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries,--a



<P>wonderful lot of handy men they must have been too--



<P>used to build, apparently by the hundred, in a month



<P>or two, if we may believe what we read.&nbsp; Imagine him



<P>here--the very end of the world, a sea the color of lead,



<P>a sky the color of smoke, a kind of ship about as rigid



<P>as a concertina--and going up this river with stores, or



<P>orders, or what you like.&nbsp; Sandbanks, marshes, forests,



<P>savages,--precious little to eat fit for a civilized man,



<P>nothing but Thames water to drink.&nbsp; No Falernian wine



<P>here, no going ashore.&nbsp; Here and there a military camp



<P>lost in a wilderness, like a needle in a bundle of hay--



<P>cold, fog, tempests, disease, exile, and death,--death



<P>skulking in the air, in the water, in the bush.&nbsp; They



<P>must have been dying like flies here.&nbsp; Oh yes--he did it.



<P>Did it very well, too, no doubt, and without thinking



<P>much about it either, except afterwards to brag of what



<P>he had gone through in his time, perhaps.&nbsp; They were



<P>men enough to face the darkness.&nbsp; And perhaps he was



<P>cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to



<P>the fleet at Ravenna by-and-by, if he had good friends



<P>in Rome and survived the awful climate.&nbsp; Or think of



<P>a decent young citizen in a toga--perhaps too much



<P>dice, you know--coming out here in the train of some



<P>prefect, or tax-gatherer, or trader even, to mend his



<P>fortunes.&nbsp; Land in a swamp, march through the woods,



<P>and in some inland post feel the savagery, the utter



<P>savagery, had closed round him,--all that mysterious



<P>life of the wilderness that stirs in the forest, in the



<P>jungles, in the hearts of wild men.&nbsp; There's no initiation



<P>either into such mysteries.&nbsp; He has to live in the midst



<P>of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable.&nbsp; And



<P>it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him.



<P>The fascination of the abomination--you know.



<P>Imagine the growing regrets, the longing to escape, the



<P>powerless disgust, the surrender, the hate."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He paused.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mind," he began again, lifting one arm from the



<P>elbow, the palm of the hand outwards, so that, with his



<P>legs folded before him, he had the pose of a Buddha



<P>preaching in European clothes and without a lotus-



<P>flower--"Mind, none of us would feel exactly like this.



<P>What saves us is efficiency--the devotion to efficiency.



<P>But these chaps were not much account, really.&nbsp; They



<P>were no colonists; their administration was merely a



<P>squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect.&nbsp; They were con-



<P>querors, and for that you want only brute force--nothing



<P>to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is



<P>just an accident arising from the weakness of others.



<P>They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what



<P>was to be got.&nbsp; It was just robbery with violence, aggra-



<P>vated murder on a great scale, and men going at it blind



<P>--as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness.&nbsp; The



<P>conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking



<P>it away from those who have a different complexion or



<P>slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing



<P>when you look into it too much.&nbsp; What redeems it is the



<P>idea only.&nbsp; An idea at the back of it; not a sentimental



<P>pretense but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the idea



<P>--something you can set up, and bow down before, and



<P>offer a sacrifice to. . . ."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He broke off.&nbsp; Flames glided in the river, small green



<P>flames, red flames, white flames, pursuing, overtaking,



<P>joining, crossing each other--then separating slowly or



<P>hastily.&nbsp; The traffic of the great city went on in the



<P>deepening night upon the sleepless river.&nbsp; We looked



<P>on, waiting patiently--there was nothing else to do till



<P>the end of the flood; but it was only after a long silence,



<P>when he said, in a hesitating voice, "I suppose you fel-



<P>lows remember I did once turn fresh-water sailor for a



<P>bit," that we knew we were fated, before the ebb began



<P>to run, to hear about one of Marlow's inconclusive ex-



<P>periences.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't want to bother you much with what hap-



<P>pened to me personally," he began, showing in this re-



<P>mark the weakness of many tellers of tales who seem



<P>so often unaware of what their audience would best like



<P>to hear; "yet to understand the effect of it on me you



<P>ought to know how I got out there, what I saw, how I



<P>went up that river to the place where I first met the



<P>poor chap.&nbsp; It was the farthest point of navigation and



<P>the culminating point of my experience.&nbsp; It seemed some-



<P>how to throw a kind of light on everything about me--



<P>and into my thoughts.&nbsp; It was somber enough too--and



<P>pitiful--not extraordinary in any way--not very clear



<P>either.&nbsp; No, not very clear.&nbsp; And yet it seemed to throw



<P>a kind of light.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had then, as you remember, just returned to Lon-



<P>don after a lot of Indian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas--



<P>a regular dose of the East--six years or so, and I was



<P>loafing about, hindering you fellows in your work and



<P>invading your homes, just as though I had got a



<P>heavenly mission to civilize you.&nbsp; It was very fine for



<P>a time, but after a bit I did get tired of resting.&nbsp; Then



<P>I began to look for a ship--I should think the hardest



<P>work on earth.&nbsp; But the ships wouldn't even look at me.



<P>And I got tired of that game too.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for



<P>maps.&nbsp; I would look for hours at South America, or



<P>Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in all the glories



<P>of exploration.&nbsp; At that time there were many blank



<P>spaces on the earth, and when I saw one that looked



<P>particularly inviting on a map (but they all look that)



<P>I would put my finger on it and say, When I grow up



<P>I will go there.&nbsp; The North Pole was one of these places,



<P>I remember.&nbsp; Well, I haven't been there yet, and shall



<P>not try now.&nbsp; The glamour's off.&nbsp; Other places were



<P>scattered about the Equator, and in every sort of lati-



<P>tude all over the two hemispheres.&nbsp; I have been in some



<P>of them, and . . . well, we won't talk about that.&nbsp; But



<P>there was one yet--the biggest, the most blank, so to



<P>speak--that I had a hankering after.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"True, by this time it was not a blank space any



<P>more.&nbsp; It had got filled since my boyhood with rivers



<P>and lakes and names.&nbsp; It had ceased to be a blank space



<P>of delightful mystery--a white patch for a boy to dream



<P>gloriously over.&nbsp; It had become a place of darkness.&nbsp; But



<P>there was in it one river especially, a mighty big river,



<P>that you could see on the map, resembling an immense



<P>snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at



<P>rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost



<P>in the depths of the land.&nbsp; And as I looked at the map



<P>of it in a shop-window, it fascinated me as a snake would



<P>a bird--a silly little bird.&nbsp; Then I remembered there was



<P>a big concern, a Company for trade on that river.&nbsp; Dash



<P>it all!&nbsp; I thought to myself, they can't trade without



<P>using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh water--



<P>steamboats!&nbsp; Why shouldn't I try to get charge of



<P>one.&nbsp; I went on along Fleet Street, but could not shake



<P>off the idea.&nbsp; The snake had charmed me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You understand it was a Continental concern, that



<P>Trading society; but I have a lot of relations living



<P>on the Continent, because it's cheap and not so nasty



<P>as it looks, they say.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am sorry to own I began to worry them.&nbsp; This was



<P>already a fresh departure for me.&nbsp; I was not used to



<P>get things that way, you know.&nbsp; I always went my own



<P>road and on my own legs where I had a mind to go.&nbsp; I



<P>wouldn't have believed it of myself; but, then--you see



<P>--I felt somehow I must get there by hook or by crook.



<P>So I worried them.&nbsp; The men said 'My dear fellow,' and



<P>did nothing.&nbsp; Then--would you believe it?--I tried the



<P>women.&nbsp; I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to work--to



<P>get a job.&nbsp; Heavens!&nbsp; Well, you see, the notion drove



<P>me.&nbsp; I had an aunt, a dear enthusiastic soul.&nbsp; She wrote:



<P>'It will be delightful.&nbsp; I am ready to do anything, any-



<P>thing for you.&nbsp; It is a glorious idea.&nbsp; I know the wife



<P>of a very high personage in the Administration, and



<P>also a man who has lots of influence with,' &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; She



<P>was determined to make no end of fuss to get me ap-



<P>pointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my



<P>fancy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I got my appointment--of course; and I got it very



<P>quick.&nbsp; It appears the Company had received news that



<P>one of their captains had been killed in a scuffle with



<P>the natives.&nbsp; This was my chance, and it made me the



<P>more anxious to go.&nbsp; It was only months and months



<P>afterwards, when I made the attempt to recover what



<P>was left of the body, that I heard the original quarrel



<P>arose from a misunderstanding about some hens.&nbsp; Yes,



<P>two black hens.&nbsp; Fresleven--that was the fellow's name,



<P>a Dane--thought himself wronged somehow in the bar-



<P>gain, so he went ashore and started to hammer the chief



<P>of the village with a stick.&nbsp; Oh, it didn't surprise me



<P>in the least to hear this, and at the same time to be told



<P>that Fresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that



<P>ever walked on two legs.&nbsp; No doubt he was; but he



<P>had been a couple of years already out there engaged



<P>in the noble cause, you know, and he probably felt the



<P>need at last of asserting his self-respect in some way.



<P>Therefore he whacked the old nigger mercilessly, while



<P>a big crowd of his people watched him, thunderstruck,



<P>till some man,--I was told the chief's son,--in despera-



<P>tion at hearing the old chap yell, made a tentative jab



<P>with a spear at the white man--and of course it went



<P>quite easy between the shoulder-blades.&nbsp; Then the whole



<P>population cleared into the forest, expecting all kinds



<P>of calamities to happen, while, on the other hand, the



<P>steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic,



<P>in charge of the engineer, I believe.&nbsp; Afterwards nobody



<P>seemed to trouble much about Fresleven's remains, till



<P>I got out and stepped into his shoes.&nbsp; I couldn't let



<P>it rest, though; but when an opportunity offered at last



<P>to meet my predecessor, the grass growing through his



<P>ribs was tall enough to hide his bones.&nbsp; They were all



<P>there.&nbsp; The supernatural being had not been touched



<P>after he fell.&nbsp; And the village was deserted, the huts



<P>gaped black, rotting, all askew within the fallen en-



<P>closures.&nbsp; A calamity had come to it, sure enough.&nbsp; The



<P>people had vanished.&nbsp; Mad terror had scattered them,



<P>men, women, and children, through the bush, and they



<P>had never returned.&nbsp; What became of the hens I don't



<P>know either.&nbsp; I should think the cause of progress got



<P>them, anyhow.&nbsp; However, through this glorious affair I



<P>got my appointment, before I had fairly begun to hope



<P>for it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I flew around like mad to get ready, and before forty-



<P>eight hours I was crossing the Channel to show myself



<P>to my employers, and sign the contract.&nbsp; In a very few



<P>hours I arrived in a city that always makes me think of



<P>a whited sepulcher.&nbsp; Prejudice no doubt.&nbsp; I had no



<P>difficulty in finding the Company's offices.&nbsp; It was the



<P>biggest thing in the town, and everybody I met was



<P>full of it.&nbsp; They were going to run an over-sea empire,



<P>and make no end of coin by trade.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A narrow and deserted street in deep shadow, high



<P>houses, innumerable windows with venetian blinds, a dead



<P>silence, grass sprouting between the stones, imposing



<P>carriage archways right and left, immense double doors



<P>standing ponderously ajar.&nbsp; I slipped through one of



<P>these cracks, went up a swept and ungarnished staircase,



<P>as arid as a desert, and opened the first door I came to.



<P>Two women, one fat and the other slim, sat on straw-



<P>bottomed chairs, knitting black wool.&nbsp; The slim one got



<P>up and walked straight at me--still knitting with down-



<P>cast eyes--and only just as I began to think of getting



<P>out of her way, as you would for a somnambulist, stood



<P>still, and looked up.&nbsp; Her dress was as plain as an um-



<P>brella-cover, and she turned round without a word and



<P>preceded me into a waiting-room.&nbsp; I gave my name, and



<P>looked about.&nbsp; Deal table in the middle, plain chairs all



<P>round the walls, on one end a large shining map, marked



<P>with all the colors of a rainbow.&nbsp; There was a vast



<P>amount of red--good to see at any time, because one



<P>knows that some real work is done in there, a deuce of a



<P>lot of blue, a little green, smears of orange, and, on the



<P>East Coast, a purple patch, to show where the jolly



<P>pioneers of progress drink the jolly lager-beer.&nbsp; How-



<P>ever, I wasn't going into any of these.&nbsp; I was going



<P>into the yellow.&nbsp; Dead in the center.&nbsp; And the river



<P>was there--fascinating--deadly--like a snake.&nbsp; Ough!



<P>A door opened, a white-haired secretarial head, but



<P>wearing a compassionate expression, appeared, and a



<P>skinny forefinger beckoned me into the sanctuary.&nbsp; Its



<P>light was dim, and a heavy writing-desk squatted in the



<P>middle.&nbsp; From behind that structure came out an im-



<P>pression of pale plumpness in a frock-coat.&nbsp; The great



<P>man himself.&nbsp; He was five feet six, I should judge, and



<P>had his grip on the handle-end of ever so many millions.



<P>He shook hands, I fancy, murmured vaguely, was satis-



<P>fied with my French.&nbsp; Bon voyage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"In about forty-five seconds I found myself again in



<P>the waiting-room with the compassionate secretary, who,



<P>full of desolation and sympathy, made me sign some



<P>document.&nbsp; I believe I undertook amongst other things



<P>not to disclose any trade secrets.&nbsp; Well, I am not going



<P>to.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I began to feel slightly uneasy.&nbsp; You know I am



<P>not used to such ceremonies, and there was something



<P>ominous in the atmosphere.&nbsp; It was just as though I



<P>had been let into some conspiracy--I don't know--some-



<P>thing not quite right; and I was glad to get out.&nbsp; In



<P>the outer room the two women knitted black wool fever-



<P>ishly.&nbsp; People were arriving, and the younger one was



<P>walking back and forth introducing them.&nbsp; The old



<P>one sat on her chair.&nbsp; Her flat cloth slippers were



<P>propped up on a foot-warmer, and a cat reposed on



<P>her lap.&nbsp; She wore a starched white affair on her head,



<P>had a wart on one cheek, and silver-rimmed spectacles



<P>hung on the tip of her nose.&nbsp; She glanced at me above



<P>the glasses.&nbsp; The swift and indifferent placidity of that



<P>look troubled me.&nbsp; Two youths with foolish and cheery



<P>countenances were being piloted over, and she threw at



<P>them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom.&nbsp; She



<P>seemed to know all about them and about me too.&nbsp; An



<P>eerie feeling came over me.&nbsp; She seemed uncanny and



<P>fateful.&nbsp; Often far away there I thought of these two,



<P>guarding the door of Darkness, knitting black wool as



<P>for a warm pall, one introducing, introducing continu-



<P>ously to the unknown, the other scrutinizing the cheery



<P>and foolish faces with unconcerned old eyes.&nbsp; Ave!&nbsp; Old



<P>knitter of black wool.&nbsp; Morituri te salutant.&nbsp; Not many



<P>of those she looked at ever saw her again--not half,



<P>by a long way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There was yet a visit to the doctor.&nbsp; 'A simple for-



<P>mality,' assured me the secretary, with an air of taking



<P>an immense part in all my sorrows.&nbsp; Accordingly a



<P>young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow, some



<P>clerk I suppose,--there must have been clerks in the busi-



<P>ness, though the house was as still as a house in a city



<P>of the dead,--came from somewhere up-stairs, and led



<P>me forth.&nbsp; He was shabby and careless, with ink-stains



<P>on the sleeves of his jacket, and his cravat was large and



<P>billowy, under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot.



<P>It was a little too early for the doctor, so I proposed



<P>a drink, and thereupon he developed a vein of joviality.



<P>As we sat over our vermouths he glorified the Company's



<P>business, and by-and-by I expressed casually my sur-



<P>prise at him not going out there.&nbsp; He became very cool



<P>and collected all at once.&nbsp; 'I am not such a fool as I



<P>look, quoth Plato to his disciples,' he said sententiously,



<P>emptied his glass with great resolution, and we rose.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The old doctor felt my pulse, evidently thinking of



<P>something else the while.&nbsp; 'Good, good for there,' he



<P>mumbled, and then with a certain eagerness asked me



<P>whether I would let him measure my head.&nbsp; Rather sur-



<P>prised, I said Yes, when he produced a thing like calipers



<P>and got the dimensions back and front and every way,



<P>taking notes carefully.&nbsp; He was an unshaven little man



<P>in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine, with his feet in



<P>slippers, and I thought him a harmless fool.&nbsp; 'I always



<P>ask leave, in the interests of science, to measure the



<P>crania of those going out there,' he said.&nbsp; 'And when



<P>they come back too?' I asked.&nbsp; "Oh, I never see them,'



<P>he remarked; 'and, moreover, the changes take place in-



<P>side, you know.'&nbsp; He smiled, as if at some quiet joke.



<P>'So you are going out there.&nbsp; Famous.&nbsp; Interesting too.'



<P>He gave me a searching glance, and made another note.



<P>'Ever any madness in your family?' he asked, in a



<P>matter-of-fact tone.&nbsp; I felt very annoyed.&nbsp; 'Is that



<P>question in the interests of science too?'&nbsp; 'It would be,'



<P>he said, without taking notice of my irritation, 'interest-



<P>ing for science to watch the mental changes of individ-



<P>uals, on the spot, but . . .'&nbsp; 'Are you an alienist?' I



<P>interrupted.&nbsp; 'Every doctor should be--a little,' an-



<P>swered that original, imperturbably.&nbsp; 'I have a little



<P>theory which you Messieurs who go out there must help



<P>me to prove.&nbsp; This is my share in the advantages my



<P>country shall reap from the possession of such a mag-



<P>nificent dependency.&nbsp; The mere wealth I leave to others.



<P>Pardon my questions, but you are the first Englishman



<P>coming under my observation. . . .'&nbsp; I hastened to



<P>assure him I was not in the least typical.&nbsp; 'If I were,'



<P>said I, 'I wouldn't be talking like this with you.'&nbsp; 'What



<P>you say is rather profound, and probably erroneous,' he



<P>said, with a laugh.&nbsp; 'Avoid irritation more than expos-



<P>ure to the sun.&nbsp; Adieu.&nbsp; How do you English say, eh?



<P>Good-by.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Good-by.&nbsp; Adieu.&nbsp; In the tropics

one



<P>must before everything keep calm.' . . .&nbsp; He lifted a



<P>warning forefinger. . . .&nbsp; 'Du calme, du calme.



<P>Adieu.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"One thing more remained to do--say good-by to



<P>my excellent aunt.&nbsp; I found her triumphant.&nbsp; I had a



<P>cup of tea--the last decent cup of tea for many days



<P>--and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you



<P>would expect a lady's drawing-room to look, we had a



<P>long quiet chat by the fireside.&nbsp; In the course of these



<P>confidences it became quite plain to me I had been repre-



<P>sented to the wife of the high dignitary, and goodness



<P>knows to how many more people besides, as an excep-



<P>tional and gifted creature--a piece of good fortune for



<P>the Company--a man you don't get hold of every day.



<P>Good heavens! and I was going to take charge of a



<P>two-penny-halfpenny river-steamboat with a penny



<P>whistle attached!&nbsp; It appeared, however, I was also one



<P>of the Workers, with a capital--you know.&nbsp; Something



<P>like an emissary of light, something like a lower sort



<P>of apostle.&nbsp; There had been a lot of such rot let loose



<P>in print and talk just about that time, and the excellent



<P>woman, living right in the rush of all that humbug, got



<P>carried off her feet.&nbsp; She talked about 'weaning those



<P>ignorant millions from their horrid ways,' till, upon my



<P>word, she made me quite uncomfortable.&nbsp; I ventured to



<P>hint that the Company was run for profit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'You forget, dear Charlie, that the laborer is worthy



<P>of his hire,' she said, brightly.&nbsp; It's queer how out of



<P>touch with truth women are.&nbsp; They live in a world of



<P>their own, and there had never been anything like it,



<P>and never can be.&nbsp; It is too beautiful altogether, and



<P>if they were to set it up it would go to pieces before



<P>the first sunset.&nbsp; Some confounded fact we men have



<P>been living contentedly with ever since the day of cre-



<P>ation would start up and knock the whole thing over.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"After this I got embraced, told to wear flannel, be



<P>sure to write often, and so on--and I left.&nbsp; In the street



<P>--I don't know why--a queer feeling came to me that I



<P>was an impostor.&nbsp; Odd thing that I, who used to clear



<P>out for any part of the world at twenty-four hours'



<P>notice, with less thought than most men give to the cross-



<P>ing of a street, had a moment--I won't say of hesitation,



<P>but of startled pause, before this commonplace affair.



<P>The best way I can explain it to you is by saying that,



<P>for a second or two, I felt as though, instead of going



<P>to the center of a continent, I were about to set off for



<P>the center of the earth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I left in a French steamer, and she called in every



<P>blamed port they have out there, for, as far as I could



<P>see, the sole purpose of landing soldiers and custom-



<P>house officers.&nbsp; I watched the coast.&nbsp; Watching a coast



<P>as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma.



<P>There it is before you--smiling, frowning, inviting,



<P>grand, mean, insipid, or savage, and always mute with



<P>an air of whispering, Come and find out.&nbsp; This one was



<P>almost featureless, as if still in the making, with an



<P>aspect of monotonous grimness.&nbsp; The edge of a colossal



<P>jungle, so dark-green as to be almost black, fringed



<P>with white surf, ran straight, like a ruled line, far, far



<P>away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a



<P>creeping mist.&nbsp; The sun was fierce, the land seemed to



<P>glisten and drip with steam.&nbsp; Here and there grayish-



<P>whitish specks showed up, clustered inside the white surf,



<P>with a flag flying above them perhaps.&nbsp; Settlements some



<P>centuries old, and still no bigger than pin-heads on the



<P>untouched expanse of their background.&nbsp; We pounded



<P>along, stopped, landed soldiers; went on, landed custom-



<P>house clerks to levy toll in what looked like a God-for-



<P>saken wilderness, with a tin shed and a flag-pole lost in



<P>it; landed more soldiers--to take care of the custom-



<P>house clerks, presumably.&nbsp; Some, I heard, got drowned



<P>in the surf; but whether they did or not, nobody seemed



<P>particularly to care.&nbsp; They were just flung out there,



<P>and on we went.&nbsp; Every day the coast looked the same,



<P>as though we had not moved; but we passed various



<P>places--trading places--with names like Gran' Bassam



<P>Little Popo, names that seemed to belong to some sordid



<P>farce acted in front of a sinister backcloth.&nbsp; The idle-



<P>ness of a passenger, my isolation amongst all these men



<P>with whom I had no point of contact, the oily and lan-



<P>guid sea, the uniform somberness of the coast, seemed



<P>to keep me away from the truth of things, within the



<P>toil of a mournful and senseless delusion.&nbsp; The voice of



<P>the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure,



<P>like the speech of a brother.&nbsp; It was something natural,



<P>that had its reason, that had a meaning.&nbsp; Now and then



<P>a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact



<P>with reality.&nbsp; It was paddled by black fellows.&nbsp; You



<P>could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glisten-



<P>ing.&nbsp; They shouted, sang; their bodies streamed with



<P>perspiration; they had faces like grotesque masks--these



<P>chaps; but they had bone, muscle, a wild vitality, an in-



<P>tense energy of movement, that was as natural and true



<P>as the surf along their coast.&nbsp; They wanted no excuse



<P>for being there.&nbsp; They were a great comfort to look at.



<P>For a time I would feel I belonged still to a world of



<P>straightforward facts; but the feeling would not last



<P>long.&nbsp; Something would turn up to scare it away.&nbsp; Once,



<P>I remember, we came upon a man-of-war anchored off



<P>the coast.&nbsp; There wasn't even a shed there, and she



<P>was shelling the bush.&nbsp; It appears the French had one



<P>of their wars going on thereabouts.&nbsp; Her ensign dropped



<P>limp like a rag; the muzzles of the long eight-inch guns



<P>stuck out all over the low hull; the greasy, slimy swell



<P>swung her up lazily and let her down, swaying her thin



<P>masts.&nbsp; In the empty immensity of earth, sky, and water,



<P>there she was, incomprehensible, firing into a continent.



<P>Pop, would go one of the eight-inch guns; a small flame



<P>would dart and vanish, a little white smoke would dis-



<P>appear, a tiny projectile would give a feeble screech--



<P>and nothing happened.&nbsp; Nothing could happen.&nbsp; There



<P>was a touch of insanity in the proceeding, a sense of



<P>lugubrious drollery in the sight; and it was not dissi-



<P>pated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there



<P>was a camp of natives--he called them enemies!--hidden



<P>out of sight somewhere.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We gave her her letters (I heard the men in that



<P>lonely ship were dying of fever at the rate of three



<P>a day) and went on.&nbsp; We called at some more places with



<P>farcical names, where the merry dance of death and



<P>trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an



<P>overheated catacomb; all along the formless coast bor-



<P>dered by dangerous surf, as if Nature herself had tried



<P>to ward off intruders; in and out of rivers, streams of



<P>death in life, whose banks were rotting into mud, whose



<P>waters, thickened into slime, invaded the contorted man-



<P>groves, that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of



<P>an impotent despair.&nbsp; Nowhere did we stop long enough



<P>to get a particularized impression, but the general sense



<P>of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me.&nbsp; It was



<P>like a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for night-



<P>mares.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was upward of thirty days before I saw the mouth



<P>of the big river.&nbsp; We anchored off the seat of the gov-



<P>ernment.&nbsp; But my work would not begin till some two



<P>hundred miles farther on.&nbsp; So as soon as I could I made



<P>a start for a place thirty miles higher up.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had my passage on a little sea-going steamer.&nbsp; Her



<P>captain was a Swede, and knowing me for a seaman,



<P>invited me on the bridge.&nbsp; He was a young man, lean,



<P>fair, and morose, with lanky hair and a shuffling gait.



<P>As we left the miserable little wharf, he tossed his head



<P>contemptuously at the shore.&nbsp; 'Been living there?' he



<P>asked.&nbsp; I said, 'Yes.'&nbsp; 'Fine lot these government chaps



<P>--are they not?' he went on, speaking English with



<P>great precision and considerable bitterness.&nbsp; 'It is funny



<P>what some people will do for a few francs a month.&nbsp; I



<P>wonder what becomes of that kind when it goes up coun-



<P>try?'&nbsp; I said to him I expected to see that soon.&nbsp; 'So-o-o!'



<P>he exclaimed.&nbsp; He shuffled athwart, keeping one eye



<P>ahead vigilantly.&nbsp; 'Don't be too sure,' he continued.



<P>'The other day I took up a man who hanged himself



<P>on the road.&nbsp; He was a Swede, too.'&nbsp; 'Hanged himself!



<P>Why, in God's name?' I cried.&nbsp; He kept on looking out



<P>watchfully.&nbsp; 'Who knows?&nbsp; The sun too much for him,



<P>or the country perhaps.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"At last we opened a reach.&nbsp; A rocky cliff appeared,



<P>mounds of turned-up earth by the shore, houses on a



<P>hill, others, with iron roofs, amongst a waste of excava-



<P>tions, or hanging to the declivity.&nbsp; A continuous noise



<P>of the rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited



<P>devastation.&nbsp; A lot of people, mostly black and naked,



<P>moved about like ants.&nbsp; A jetty projected into the river.



<P>A blinding sunlight drowned all this at times in a sudden



<P>recrudescence of glare.&nbsp; 'There's your Company's sta-



<P>tion,' said the Swede, pointing to three wooden barrack-



<P>like structures on the rocky slope.&nbsp; 'I will send your



<P>things up.&nbsp; Four boxes did you say?&nbsp; So.&nbsp; Farewell.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass, then



<P>found a path leading up the hill.&nbsp; It turned aside for



<P>the bowlders, and also for an undersized railway-truck



<P>lying there on its back with its wheels in the air.&nbsp; One



<P>was off.&nbsp; The thing looked as dead as the carcass of



<P>some animal.&nbsp; I came upon more pieces of decaying ma-



<P>chinery, a stack of rusty rails.&nbsp; To the left a clump of



<P>trees made a shady spot, where dark things seemed to



<P>stir feebly.&nbsp; I blinked, the path was steep.&nbsp; A horn tooted



<P>to the right, and I saw the black people run.&nbsp; A heavy



<P>and dull detonation shook the ground, a puff of smoke



<P>came out of the cliff, and that was all.&nbsp; No change ap-



<P>peared on the face of the rock.&nbsp; They were building a



<P>railway.&nbsp; The cliff was not in the way or anything; but



<P>this objectless blasting was all the work going on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A slight clinking behind me made me turn my head.



<P>Six black men advanced in a file, toiling up the path.



<P>They walked erect and slow, balancing small baskets



<P>full of earth on their heads, and the clink kept time with



<P>their footsteps.&nbsp; Black rags were wound round their



<P>loins, and the short ends behind wagged to and fro like



<P>tails.&nbsp; I could see every rib, the joints of their limbs



<P>were like knots in a rope; each had an iron collar on



<P>his neck, and all were connected together with a chain



<P>whose bights swung between them, rhythmically clinking.



<P>Another report from the cliff made me think suddenly



<P>of that ship of war I had seen firing into a continent.



<P>It was the same kind of ominous voice; but these men



<P>could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies.



<P>They were called criminals, and the outraged law, like



<P>the bursting shells, had come to them, an insoluble mys-



<P>tery from over the sea.&nbsp; All their meager breasts panted



<P>together, the violently dilated nostrils quivered, the eyes



<P>stared stonily uphill.&nbsp; They passed me within six inches,



<P>without a glance, with that complete, deathlike indif-



<P>ference of unhappy savages.&nbsp; Behind this raw matter



<P>one of the reclaimed, the product of the new forces at



<P>work, strolled despondently, carrying a rifle by its



<P>middle.&nbsp; He had a uniform jacket with one button off,



<P>and seeing a white man on the path, hoisted his weapon



<P>to his shoulder with alacrity.&nbsp; This was simple prudence,



<P>white men being so much alike at a distance that he could



<P>not tell who I might be.&nbsp; He was speedily reassured, and



<P>with a large, white, rascally grin, and a glance at his



<P>charge, seemed to take me into partnership in his exalted



<P>trust.&nbsp; After all, I also was a part of the great cause



<P>of these high and just proceedings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Instead of going up, I turned and descended to the



<P>left.&nbsp; My idea was to let that chain-gang get out of



<P>sight before I climbed the hill.&nbsp; You know I am not par-



<P>ticularly tender; I've had to strike and to fend off.&nbsp; I've



<P>had to resist and to attack sometimes--that's only one



<P>way of resisting--without counting the exact cost, ac-



<P>cording to the demands of such sort of life as I had blun-



<P>dered into.&nbsp; I've seen the devil of violence, and the devil



<P>of greed, and the devil of hot desire; but, by all the



<P>stars! these were strong, lusty, red-eyed devils, that



<P>swayed and drove men--men, I tell you.&nbsp; But as I stood



<P>on this hillside, I foresaw that in the blinding sunshine



<P>of that land I would become acquainted with a flabby,



<P>pretending, weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless



<P>folly.&nbsp; How insidious he could be, too, I was only to



<P>find out several months later and a thousand miles



<P>farther.&nbsp; For a moment I stood appalled, as though by



<P>a warning.&nbsp; Finally I descended the hill, obliquely, to-



<P>wards the trees I had seen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been



<P>digging on the slope, the purpose of which I found it



<P>impossible to divine.&nbsp; It wasn't a quarry or a sandpit,



<P>anyhow.&nbsp; It was just a hole.&nbsp; It might have been con-



<P>nected with the philanthropic desire of giving the crim-



<P>inals something to do.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; Then I nearly



<P>fell into a very narrow ravine, almost no more than a



<P>scar in the hillside.&nbsp; I discovered that a lot of imported



<P>drainage-pipes for the settlement had been tumbled in



<P>there.&nbsp; There wasn't one that was not broken.&nbsp; It was



<P>a wanton smash-up.&nbsp; At last I got under the trees.&nbsp; My



<P>purpose was to stroll into the shade for a moment; but



<P>no sooner within than it seemed to me I had stepped



<P>into a gloomy circle of some Inferno.&nbsp; The rapids were



<P>near, and an uninterrupted, uniform, headlong, rushing



<P>noise filled the mournful stillness of the grove, where not



<P>a breath stirred, not a leaf moved, with a mysterious



<P>sound--as though the tearing pace of the launched earth



<P>had suddenly become audible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Black shapes crouched, lay, sat between the trees,



<P>leaning against the trunks, clinging to the earth, half



<P>coming out, half effaced within the dim light, in all the



<P>attitudes of pain, abandonment, and despair.&nbsp; Another



<P>mine on the cliff went off, followed by a slight shudder



<P>of the soil under my feet.&nbsp; The work was going on.&nbsp; The



<P>work!&nbsp; And this was the place where some of the helpers



<P>had withdrawn to die.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They were dying slowly--it was very clear.&nbsp; They



<P>were not enemies, they were not criminals, they were



<P>nothing earthly now,--nothing but black shadows of



<P>disease and starvation, lying confusedly in the greenish



<P>gloom.&nbsp; Brought from all the recesses of the coast in all



<P>the legality of time contracts, lost in uncongenial sur-



<P>roundings, fed on unfamiliar food, they sickened, be-



<P>came inefficient, and were then allowed to crawl away and



<P>rest.&nbsp; These moribund shapes were free as air--and



<P>nearly as thin.&nbsp; I began to distinguish the gleam of eyes



<P>under the trees.&nbsp; Then, glancing down, I saw a face



<P>near my hand.&nbsp; The black bones reclined at full length



<P>with one shoulder against the tree, and slowly the eye-



<P>lids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me, enormous



<P>and vacant, a kind of blind, white flicker in the depths



<P>of the orbs, which died out slowly.&nbsp; The man seemed



<P>young--almost a boy--but you know with them it's hard



<P>to tell.&nbsp; I found nothing else to do but to offer him one



<P>of my good Swede's ship's biscuits I had in my pocket.



<P>The fingers closed slowly on it and held--there was no



<P>other movement and no other glance.&nbsp; He had tied a bit



<P>of white worsted round his neck--Why?&nbsp; Where did he



<P>get it?&nbsp; Was it a badge--an ornament--a charm--a



<P>propitiatory act?&nbsp; Was there any idea at all connected



<P>with it?&nbsp; It looked startling round his black neck, this



<P>bit of white thread from beyond the seas.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Near the same tree two more bundles of acute angles



<P>sat with their legs drawn up.&nbsp; One, with his chin



<P>propped on his knees, stared at nothing, in an intoler-



<P>able and appalling manner: his brother phantom rested



<P>its forehead, as if overcome with a great weariness; and



<P>all about others were scattered in every pose of contorted



<P>collapse, as in some picture of a massacre or a pestilence.



<P>While I stood horror-struck, one of these creatures rose



<P>to his hands and knees, and went off on all-fours towards



<P>the river to drink.&nbsp; He lapped out of his hand, then sat



<P>up in the sunlight, crossing his shins in front of him,



<P>and after a time let his woolly head fall on his breast-



<P>bone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I didn't want any more loitering in the shade, and



<P>I made haste towards the station.&nbsp; When near the build-



<P>ings I met a white man, in such an unexpected elegance



<P>of get-up that in the first moment I took him for a sort



<P>of vision.&nbsp; I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a



<P>light alpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clear necktie, and



<P>varnished boots.&nbsp; No hat.&nbsp; Hair parted, brushed, oiled,



<P>under a green-lined parasol held in a big white hand.



<P>He was amazing, and had a penholder behind his ear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shook hands with this miracle, and I learned he was



<P>the Company's chief accountant, and that all the book-



<P>keeping was done at this station.&nbsp; He had come out for



<P>a moment, he said, 'to get a breath of fresh air.'&nbsp; The



<P>expression sounded wonderfully odd, with its suggestion



<P>of sedentary desk-life.&nbsp; I wouldn't have mentioned the



<P>fellow to you at all, only it was from his lips that I



<P>first heard the name of the man who is so indissolubly



<P>connected with the memories of that time.&nbsp; Moreover, I



<P>respected the fellow.&nbsp; Yes; I respected his collars, his



<P>vast cuffs, his brushed hair.&nbsp; His appearance was cer-



<P>tainly that of a hairdresser's dummy; but in the great



<P>demoralization of the land he kept up his appearance.



<P>That's backbone.&nbsp; His starched collars and got-up shirt-



<P>fronts were achievements of character.&nbsp; He had been out



<P>nearly three years; and, later on, I could not help ask-



<P>ing him how he managed to sport such linen.&nbsp; He had



<P>just the faintest blush, and said modestly, 'I've been



<P>teaching one of the native women about the station.&nbsp; It



<P>was difficult.&nbsp; She had a distaste for the work.'&nbsp; This



<P>man had verily accomplished something.&nbsp; And he was



<P>devoted to his books, which were in apple-pie order.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Everything else in the station was in a muddle,--



<P>heads, things, buildings.&nbsp; Strings of dusty niggers with



<P>splay feet arrived and departed; a stream of manu-



<P>factured goods, rubbishy cottons, beads, and brass-wire



<P>set into the depths of darkness, and in return came a



<P>precious trickle of ivory.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had to wait in the station for ten days--an eternity.



<P>I lived in a hut in the yard, but to be out of the chaos



<P>I would sometimes get into the accountant's office.&nbsp; It



<P>was built of horizontal planks, and so badly put together



<P>that, as he bent over his high desk, he was barred from



<P>neck to heels with narrow strips of sunlight.&nbsp; There was



<P>no need to open the big shutter to see.&nbsp; It was hot



<P>there too; big flies buzzed fiendishly, and did not sting,



<P>but stabbed.&nbsp; I sat generally on the floor, while, of



<P>faultless appearance (and even slightly scented), perch-



<P>ing on a high stool, he wrote, he wrote.&nbsp; Sometimes he



<P>stood up for exercise.&nbsp; When a truckle-bed with a sick



<P>man (some invalided agent from up-country) was put in



<P>there, he exhibited a gentle annoyance.&nbsp; 'The groans of



<P>this sick person,' he said, distract my attention.&nbsp; And



<P>without that it is extremely difficult to guard against



<P>clerical errors in this climate.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"One day he remarked, without lifting his head, "In



<P>the interior you will no doubt meet Mr. Kurtz.'&nbsp; On my



<P>asking who Mr. Kurtz was, he said he was a first-class



<P>agent; and seeing my disappointment at this informa-



<P>tion, he added slowly, laying down his pen, 'He is a very



<P>remarkable person.'&nbsp; Further questions elicited from him



<P>that Mr. Kurtz was at present in charge of a trading



<P>post, a very important one, in the true ivory-country,



<P>at 'the very bottom of there.&nbsp; Sends in as much ivory



<P>as all the others put together. . . .'&nbsp; He began to



<P>write again.&nbsp; The sick man was too ill to groan.&nbsp; The



<P>flies buzzed in a great peace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Suddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and



<P>a great tramping of feet.&nbsp; A caravan had come in.&nbsp; A



<P>violent babble of uncouth sounds burst out on the other



<P>side of the planks.&nbsp; All the carriers were speaking to-



<P>gether, and in the midst of the uproar the lamentable



<P>voice of the chief agent was heard 'giving it up' tear-



<P>fully for the twentieth time that day. . . .&nbsp; He rose



<P>slowly.&nbsp; 'What a frightful row,' he said.&nbsp; He crossed



<P>the room gently to look at the sick man, and returning,



<P>said to me, 'He does not hear.'&nbsp; 'What!&nbsp; Dead?' I



<P>asked, startled.&nbsp; 'No, not yet,' he answered, with great



<P>composure.&nbsp; Then, alluding with a toss of the head to



<P>the tumult in the station-yard, 'When one has got to



<P>make correct entries, one comes to hate those savages--



<P>hate them to the death.'&nbsp; He remained thoughtful for a



<P>moment.&nbsp; 'When you see Mr. Kurtz,' he went on, 'tell



<P>him from me that everything here'--he glanced at the



<P>desk--'is very satisfactory.&nbsp; I don't like to write to him



<P>--with those messengers of ours you never know who



<P>may get hold of your letter--at that Central Station.'



<P>He stared at me for a moment with his mild, bulging



<P>eyes.&nbsp; 'Oh, he will go far, very far,' he began again.



<P>'He will be a somebody in the Administration before



<P>long.&nbsp; They, above--the Council in Europe, you know



<P>--mean him to be.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He turned to his work.&nbsp; The noise outside had ceased,



<P>and presently in going out I stopped at the door.&nbsp; In



<P>the steady buzz of flies the homeward-bound agent was



<P>lying flushed and insensible; the other, bent over his



<P>books, was making correct entries of perfectly correct



<P>transactions; and fifty feet below the doorstep I could



<P>see the still tree-tops of the grove of death.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Next day I left that station at last, with a caravan



<P>of sixty men, for a two-hundred-mile tramp.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No use telling you much about that.&nbsp; Paths, paths,



<P>everywhere; a stamped-in network of paths spreading



<P>over the empty land, through long grass, through burnt



<P>grass, through thickets, down and up chilly ravines, up



<P>and down stony hills ablaze with heat; and a solitude,



<P>a solitude, nobody, not a hut.&nbsp; The population had



<P>cleared out a long time ago.&nbsp; Well, if a lot of mysterious



<P>niggers armed with all kinds of fearful weapons sud-



<P>denly took to traveling on the road between Deal and



<P>Gravesend, catching the yokels right and left to carry



<P>heavy loads for them, I fancy every farm and cottage



<P>thereabouts would get empty very soon.&nbsp; Only here the



<P>dwellings were gone too.&nbsp; Still I passed through several



<P>abandoned villages.&nbsp; There's something pathetically



<P>childish in the ruins of grass walls.&nbsp; Day after day, with



<P>the stamp and shuffle of sixty pair of bare feet behind



<P>me, each pair under a 60-lb. load.&nbsp; Camp, cook, sleep,



<P>strike camp, march.&nbsp; Now and then a carrier dead in



<P>harness, at rest in the long grass near the path, with



<P>an empty water-gourd and his long staff lying by his



<P>side.&nbsp; A great silence around and above.&nbsp; Perhaps on



<P>some quiet night the tremor of far-off drums, sinking,



<P>swelling, a tremor vast, faint; a sound weird, appealing,



<P>suggestive, and wild--and perhaps with as profound a



<P>meaning as the sound of bells in a Christian country.



<P>Once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform, camping



<P>on the path with an armed escort of lank Zanzibaris,



<P>very hospitable and festive--not to say drunk.&nbsp; Was



<P>looking after the upkeep of the road, he declared.&nbsp; Can't



<P>say I saw any road or any upkeep, unless the body of a



<P>middle-aged negro, with a bullet-hole in the forehead,



<P>upon which I absolutely stumbled three miles farther on,



<P>may be considered as a permanent improvement.&nbsp; I had



<P>a white companion too, not a bad chap, but rather too



<P>fleshy and with the exasperating habit of fainting on



<P>the hot hillsides, miles away from the least bit of shade



<P>and water.&nbsp; Annoying, you know, to hold your own coat



<P>like a parasol over a man's head while he is coming-to.



<P>I couldn't help asking him once what he meant by coming



<P>there at all.&nbsp; 'To make money, of course.&nbsp; What do



<P>you think?' he said, scornfully.&nbsp; Then he got fever, and



<P>had to be carried in a hammock slung under a pole.&nbsp; As



<P>he weighed sixteen stone I had no end of rows with the



<P>carriers.&nbsp; They jibbed, ran away, sneaked off with their



<P>loads in the night--quite a mutiny.&nbsp; So, one evening,



<P>I made a speech in English with gestures, not one of



<P>which was lost to the sixty pairs of eyes before me, and



<P>the next morning I started the hammock off in front all



<P>right.&nbsp; An afterwards I came upon the whole con-



<P>cern wrecked in a bush--man, hammock, groans, blankets,



<P>horrors.&nbsp; The heavy pole had skinned his poor nose.&nbsp; He



<P>was very anxious for me to kill somebody, but there



<P>wasn't the shadow of a carrier near.&nbsp; I remembered the



<P>old doctor,--'It would be interesting for science to



<P>watch the mental changes of individuals, on the spot.'



<P>I felt I was becoming scientifically interesting.&nbsp; How-



<P>ever, all that is to no purpose.&nbsp; On the fifteenth day I



<P>came in sight of the big river again, and hobbled into



<P>the Central Station.&nbsp; It was on a back water surrounded



<P>by scrub and forest, with a pretty border of smelly mud



<P>on one side, and on the three others inclosed by a crazy



<P>fence of rushes.&nbsp; A neglected gap was all the gate it



<P>had, and the first glance at the place was enough to let



<P>you see the flabby devil was running that show.&nbsp; White



<P>men with long staves in their hands appeared languidly



<P>from amongst the buildings, strolling up to take a look



<P>at me, and then retired out of sight somewhere.&nbsp; One



<P>of them, a stout, excitable chap with black mustaches,



<P>informed me with great volubility and many digressions,



<P>as soon as I told him who I was, that my steamer was at



<P>the bottom of the river.&nbsp; I was thunderstruck.&nbsp; What,



<P>how, why?&nbsp; Oh, it was 'all right.'&nbsp; The 'manager him-



<P>self' was there.&nbsp; All quite correct.&nbsp; 'Everybody had



<P>behaved splendidly! splendidly!'--'you must,' he said



<P>in agitation, 'go and see the general manager at once.



<P>He is waiting!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I did not see the real significance of that wreck at



<P>once.&nbsp; I fancy I see it now, but I am not sure--not at



<P>all.&nbsp; Certainly the affair was too stupid--when I think



<P>of it--to be altogether natural.&nbsp; Still. . . .&nbsp; But at the



<P>moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nui-



<P>sance.&nbsp; The steamer was sunk.&nbsp; They had started two



<P>days before in a sudden hurry up the river with the



<P>manager on board, in charge of some volunteer skipper,



<P>and before they had been out three hours they tore the



<P>bottom out of her on stones, and she sank near the south



<P>bank.&nbsp; I asked myself what I was to do there, now my



<P>boat was lost.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I had plenty to do



<P>in fishing my command out of the river.&nbsp; I had to set



<P>about it the very next day.&nbsp; That, and the repairs when



<P>I brought the pieces to the station, took some months.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My first interview with the manager was curious.&nbsp; He



<P>did not ask me to sit down after my twenty-mile walk



<P>that morning.&nbsp; He was commonplace in complexion, in



<P>feature, in manners, and in voice.&nbsp; He was of middle



<P>size and of ordinary build.&nbsp; His eyes, of the usual blue,



<P>were perhaps remarkably cold, and he certainly could



<P>make his glance fall on one as trenchant and heavy as



<P>an ax.&nbsp; But even at these times the rest of his person



<P>seemed to disclaim the intention.&nbsp; Otherwise there was



<P>only an indefinable, faint expression of his lips, some-



<P>thing stealthy--a smile--not a smile--I remember it, but



<P>I can't explain.&nbsp; It was unconscious, this smile was,



<P>though just after he had said something it got intensified



<P>for an instant.&nbsp; It came at the end of his speeches like



<P>a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the



<P>commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable.&nbsp; He



<P>was a common trader, from his youth up employed in



<P>these parts--nothing more.&nbsp; He was obeyed, yet he in-



<P>spired neither love nor fear, nor even respect.&nbsp; He in-



<P>spired uneasiness.&nbsp; That was it!&nbsp; Uneasiness.&nbsp; Not a



<P>definite mistrust--just uneasiness--nothing more.&nbsp; You



<P>have no idea how effective such a . . . a . . . fac-



<P>ulty can be.&nbsp; He had no genius for organizing, for



<P>initiative, or for order even.&nbsp; That was evident in such



<P>things as the deplorable state of the station.&nbsp; He had



<P>no learning, and no intelligence.&nbsp; His position had come



<P>to him--why?&nbsp; Perhaps because he was never ill . . .



<P>He had served three terms of three years out there . . .



<P>Because triumphant health in the general rout of con-



<P>stitutions is a kind of power in itself.&nbsp; When he went



<P>home on leave he rioted on a large scale--pompously.



<P>Jack ashore--with a difference--in externals only.&nbsp; This



<P>one could gather from his casual talk.&nbsp; He originated



<P>nothing, he could keep the routine going--that's all.



<P>But he was great.&nbsp; He was great by this little thing that



<P>it was impossible to tell what could control such a man.



<P>He never gave that secret away.&nbsp; Perhaps there was



<P>nothing within him.&nbsp; Such a suspicion made one pause



<P>--for out there there were no external checks.&nbsp; Once



<P>when various tropical diseases had laid low almost every



<P>'agent' in the station, he was heard to say, 'Men who



<P>come out here should have no entrails.'&nbsp; He sealed the



<P>utterance with that smile of his, as though it had been



<P>a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping.



<P>You fancied you had seen things--but the seal was on.



<P>When annoyed at meal-times by the constant quarrels



<P>of the white men about precedence, he ordered an im-



<P>mense round table to be made, for which a special house



<P>had to be built.&nbsp; This was the station's mess-room.&nbsp; Where



<P>he sat was the first place--the rest were nowhere.&nbsp; One



<P>felt this to be his unalterable conviction.&nbsp; He was neither



<P>civil nor uncivil.&nbsp; He was quiet.&nbsp; He allowed his 'boy'



<P>--an overfed young negro from the coast--to treat the



<P>white men, under his very eyes, with provoking insolence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He began to speak as soon as he saw me.&nbsp; I had



<P>been very long on the road.&nbsp; He could not wait.&nbsp; Had



<P>to start without me.&nbsp; The up-river stations had to be



<P>relieved.&nbsp; There had been so many delays already that



<P>he did not know who was dead and who was alive, and



<P>how they got on--and so on, and so on.&nbsp; He paid no



<P>attention to my explanations, and, playing with a stick



<P>of sealing-wax, repeated several times that the situation



<P>was 'very grave, very grave.'&nbsp; There were rumors that



<P>a very important station was in jeopardy, and its chief,



<P>Mr. Kurtz, was ill.&nbsp; Hoped it was not true.&nbsp; Mr. Kurtz



<P>was . . .&nbsp; I felt weary and irritable.&nbsp; Hang Kurtz, I



<P>thought.&nbsp; I interrupted him by saying I had heard of



<P>Mr. Kurtz on the coast.&nbsp; 'Ah!&nbsp; So they talk of him



<P>down there,' he murmured to himself.&nbsp; Then he began



<P>again, assuring me Mr. Kurtz was the best agent he



<P>had, an exceptional man, of the greatest importance to



<P>the Company; therefore I could understand his anxiety.



<P>He was, he said, 'very, very uneasy.'&nbsp; Certainly he



<P>fidget on his chair a good deal, exclaimed, 'Ah, Mr.



<P>Kurtz!' broke the stick of sealing-wax and seemed dumb-



<P>founded by the accident.&nbsp; Next thing he wanted to know



<P>'how long it would take to' . . .&nbsp; I interrupted him



<P>again.&nbsp; Being hungry, you know, and kept on my feet



<P>too, I was getting savage.&nbsp; 'How could I tell,' I said.



<P>'I hadn't even seen the wreck yet--some months, no



<P>doubt.'&nbsp; All this talk seemed to me so futile.&nbsp; 'Some



<P>months,' he said.&nbsp; 'Well, let us say three months before



<P>we can make a start.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; That ought to do the affair.'



<P>I flung out of his hut (he lived all alone in a clay hut



<P>with a sort of veranda) muttering to myself my opinion



<P>of him.&nbsp; He was a chattering idiot.&nbsp; Afterwards I took



<P>it back when it was borne in upon me startlingly with



<P>what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite



<P>for the 'affair.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I went to work the next day, turning, so to speak,



<P>my back on that station.&nbsp; In that way only it seemed



<P>to me I could keep my hold on the redeeming facts of



<P>life.&nbsp; Still, one must look about sometimes; and then I



<P>saw this station, these men strolling aimlessly about in



<P>the sunshine of the yard.&nbsp; I asked myself sometimes what



<P>it all meant.&nbsp; They wandered here and there with their



<P>absurd long staves in their hands, like a lot of faithless



<P>pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence.&nbsp; The word



<P>'ivory' rang in the air, was whispered, was sighed.&nbsp; You



<P>would think they were praying to it.&nbsp; A taint of imbecile



<P>rapacity blew through it all, like a whiff from some



<P>corpse.&nbsp; By Jove!&nbsp; I've never seen anything so unreal



<P>in my life.&nbsp; And outside, the silent wilderness surround-



<P>ing this cleared speck on the earth struck me as some-



<P>thing great and invincible, like evil or truth, waiting



<P>patiently for the passing away of this fantastic in-



<P>vasion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, these months!&nbsp; Well, never mind.&nbsp; Various things



<P>happened.&nbsp; One evening a grass shed full of calico, cotton



<P>prints, beads, and I don't know what else, burst into a



<P>blaze so suddenly that you would have thought the earth



<P>had opened to let an avenging fire consume all that trash.



<P>I was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer,



<P>and saw them all cutting capers in the light, with their



<P>arms lifted high, when the stout man with mustaches



<P>came tearing down to the river, a tin pail in his hand,



<P>assured me that everybody was 'behaving splendidly,



<P>splendidly, dipped about a quart of water and tore back



<P>again.&nbsp; I noticed there was a hole in the bottom of his



<P>pail.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I strolled up.&nbsp; There was no hurry.&nbsp; You see the



<P>thing had gone off like a box of matches.&nbsp; It had been



<P>hopeless from the very first.&nbsp; The flame had leaped high,



<P>driven everybody back, lighted up everything--and col-



<P>lapsed.&nbsp; The shed was already a heap of embers glowing



<P>fiercely.&nbsp; A nigger was being beaten near by.&nbsp; They



<P>said he had caused the fire in some way; be that as it



<P>may, he was screeching most horribly.&nbsp; I saw him, later



<P>on, for several days, sitting in a bit of shade looking



<P>very sick and trying to recover himself: afterwards he



<P>arose and went out--and the wilderness without a sound



<P>took him into its bosom again.&nbsp; As I approached the



<P>glow from the dark I found myself at the back of two



<P>men, talking.&nbsp; I heard the name of Kurtz pronounced,



<P>then the words, 'take advantage of this unfortunate ac-



<P>cident.'&nbsp; One of the men was the manager.&nbsp; I wished



<P>him a good evening.&nbsp; 'Did you ever see anything like



<P>it--eh? it is incredible,' he said, and walked off.&nbsp; The



<P>other man remained.&nbsp; He was a first-class agent, young,



<P>gentlemanly, a bit reserved, with a forked little beard



<P>and a hooked nose.&nbsp; He was stand-offish with the other



<P>agents, and they on their side said he was the manager's



<P>spy upon them.&nbsp; As to me, I had hardly ever spoken to



<P>him before.&nbsp; We got into talk, and by-and-by we strolled



<P>away from the hissing ruins.&nbsp; Then he asked me to his



<P>room, which was in the main building of the station.



<P>He struck a match, and I perceived that this young



<P>aristocrat had not only a silver-mounted dressing-case



<P>but also a whole candle all to himself.&nbsp; Just at that time



<P>the manager was the only man supposed to have any



<P>right to candles.&nbsp; Native mats covered the clay walls;



<P>a collection of spears, assegais, shields, knives was hung



<P>up in trophies.&nbsp; The business intrusted to this fellow



<P>was the making of bricks--so I had been informed; but



<P>there wasn't a fragment of a brick anywhere in the sta-



<P>tion, and he had been there more than a year--waiting.



<P>It seems he could not make bricks without something, I



<P>don't know what--straw maybe.&nbsp; Anyways, it could not



<P>be found there, and as it was not likely to be sent from



<P>Europe, it did not appear clear to me what he was wait-



<P>ing for.&nbsp; An act of special creation perhaps.&nbsp; However,



<P>they were all waiting--all the sixteen or twenty pilgrims



<P>of them--for something; and upon my word it did not



<P>seem an uncongenial occupation, from the way they took



<P>it, though the only thing that ever came to them was



<P>disease--as far as I could see.&nbsp; They beguiled the time



<P>by backbiting and intriguing against each other in a



<P>foolish kind of way.&nbsp; There was an air of plotting about



<P>that station, but nothing came of it, of course.&nbsp; It was



<P>as unreal as everything else--as the philanthropic pre-



<P>tense of the whole concern, as their talk, as their gov-



<P>ernment, as their show of work.&nbsp; The only real feeling



<P>was a desire to get appointed to a trading-post where



<P>ivory was to be had, so that they could earn percentages.



<P>They intrigued and slandered and hated each other only



<P>on that account,--but as to effectually lifting a little



<P>finger--oh, no.&nbsp; By heavens! there is something after



<P>all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while



<P>another must not look at a halter.&nbsp; Steal a horse straight



<P>out.&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; He has done it.&nbsp; Perhaps he can ride.



<P>But there is a way of looking at a halter that would



<P>provoke the most charitable of saints into a kick.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had no idea why he wanted to be sociable, but as



<P>we chatted in there it suddenly occurred to me the fel-



<P>low was trying to get at something--in fact, pumping



<P>me.&nbsp; He alluded constantly to Europe, to the people I



<P>was supposed to know there--putting leading questions



<P>as to my acquaintances in the sepulchral city, and so on.



<P>His little eyes glittered like mica discs--with curiosity,



<P>--though he tried to keep up a bit of superciliousness.



<P>At first I was astonished, but very soon I became awfully



<P>curious to see what he would find out from me.&nbsp; I couldn't



<P>possibly imagine what I had in me to make it worth



<P>his while.&nbsp; It was very pretty to see how he baffled him-



<P>self, for in truth my body was full of chills, and my



<P>head had nothing in it but that wretched steamboat busi-



<P>ness.&nbsp; It was evident he took me for a perfectly shame-



<P>less prevaricator.&nbsp; At last he got angry, and to conceal



<P>a movement of furious annoyance, he yawned.&nbsp; I rose.



<P>Then I noticed a small sketch in oils, on a panel, repre-



<P>senting a woman, draped and blindfolded, carrying a



<P>lighted torch.&nbsp; The background was somber--almost



<P>black.&nbsp; The movement of the woman was stately, and



<P>the effect of the torchlight on the face was sinister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It arrested me, and he stood by civilly, holding a



<P>half-pint champagne bottle (medical comforts) with the



<P>candle stuck in it.&nbsp; To my question he said Mr. Kurtz



<P>had painted this--in this very station more than a year



<P>ago--while waiting for means to go to his trading-post.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Tell me, pray,' said I, 'who is this Mr. Kurtz?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'The chief of the Inner Station,' he answered in a



<P>short tone, looking away.&nbsp; 'Much obliged,' I said, laugh-



<P>ing.&nbsp; 'And you are the brickmaker of the Central Sta-



<P>tion.&nbsp; Everyone knows that.'&nbsp; He was silent for a while.



<P>'He is a prodigy,' he said at last.&nbsp; 'He is an emissary of



<P>pity, and science, and progress, and devil knows what



<P>else.&nbsp; We want,' he began to declaim suddenly, 'for



<P>the guidance of the cause intrusted to us by Europe, so



<P>to speak, higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a single-



<P>ness of purpose.'&nbsp; 'Who says that?' I asked.&nbsp; 'Lots of



<P>them,' he replied.&nbsp; 'Some even write that; and so HE



<P>comes here, a special being, as you ought to know.'&nbsp; 'Why



<P>ought I to know?' I interrupted, really surprised.&nbsp; He



<P>paid no attention.&nbsp; 'Yes.&nbsp; To-day he is chief of the



<P>best station, next year he will be assistant-manager, two



<P>years more and . . . but I dare say you know what he



<P>will be in two years' time.&nbsp; You are of the new gang--



<P>the gang of virtue.&nbsp; The same people who sent him



<P>specially also recommended you.&nbsp; Oh, don't say no.&nbsp; I've



<P>my own eyes to trust.'&nbsp; Light dawned upon me.&nbsp; My



<P>dear aunt's influential acquaintances were producing an



<P>unexpected effect upon that young man.&nbsp; I nearly burst



<P>into a laugh.&nbsp; 'Do you read the Company's confidential



<P>correspondence?' I asked.&nbsp; He hadn't a word to say.&nbsp; It



<P>was great fun.&nbsp; 'When Mr. Kurtz,' I continued severely,



<P>'is General Manager, you won't have the opportunity.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He blew the candle out suddenly, and we went out-



<P>side.&nbsp; The moon had risen.&nbsp; Black figures strolled about



<P>listlessly, pouring water on the glow, whence proceeded



<P>a sound of hissing; steam ascended in the moonlight, the



<P>beaten nigger groaned somewhere.&nbsp; 'What a row the



<P>brute makes!' said the indefatigable man with the mus-



<P>taches, appearing near us.&nbsp; 'Serve him right.&nbsp; Trans-



<P>gression--punishment--bang!&nbsp; Pitiless, pitiless.&nbsp; That's



<P>the only way.&nbsp; This will prevent all conflagrations for



<P>the future.&nbsp; I was just telling the manager . . .'&nbsp; He



<P>noticed my companion, and became crestfallen all at once.



<P>'Not in bed yet,' he said, with a kind of servile hearti-



<P>ness; 'it's so natural.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Danger-agitation.'&nbsp; He



<P>vanished.&nbsp; I went on to the river-side, and the other fol-



<P>lowed me.&nbsp; I heard a scathing murmur at my ear, 'Heap



<P>of muffs--go to.'&nbsp; The pilgrims could be seen in knots



<P>gesticulating, discussing.&nbsp; Several had still their staves



<P>in their hands.&nbsp; I verily believe they took these sticks to



<P>bed with them.&nbsp; Beyond the fence the forest stood up



<P>spectrally in the moonlight, and through the dim stir,



<P>through the faint sounds of that lamentable courtyard,



<P>the silence of the land went home to one's very heart,--



<P>its mystery, its greatness, the amazing reality of its con-



<P>cealed life.&nbsp; The hurt nigger moaned feebly somewhere



<P>near by, and then fetched a deep sigh that made me



<P>mend my pace away from there.&nbsp; I felt a hand intro-



<P>ducing itself under my arm.&nbsp; 'My dear sir,' said the



<P>fellow, 'I don't want to be misunderstood, and especially



<P>by you, who will see Mr. Kurtz long before I can have



<P>that pleasure.&nbsp; I wouldn't like him to get a false idea



<P>of my disposition. . . .'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I let him run on, this papier-mache Mephistopheles,



<P>and it seemed to me that if I tried I could poke my fore-



<P>finger through him, and would find nothing inside but



<P>a little loose dirt, maybe.&nbsp; He, don't you see, had been



<P>planning to be assistant-manager by-and-by under the



<P>present man, and I could see that the coming of that



<P>Kurtz had upset them both not a little.&nbsp; He talked pre-



<P>cipitately, and I did not try to stop him.&nbsp; I had my



<P>shoulders against the wreck of my steamer, hauled up on



<P>the slope like a carcass of some big river animal.&nbsp; The



<P>smell of mud, of primeval mud, by Jove! was in my



<P>nostrils, the high stillness of primeval forest was before



<P>my eyes; there were shiny patches on the black creek.



<P>The moon had spread over everything a thin layer of



<P>silver--over the rank grass, over the mud, upon the



<P>wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the wall



<P>of a temple, over the great river I could see through a



<P>somber gap glittering, glittering, as it flowed broadly



<P>by without a murmur.&nbsp; All this was great, expectant,



<P>mute, while the man jabbered about himself.&nbsp; I won-



<P>dered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity



<P>looking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a



<P>menace.&nbsp; What were we who had strayed in here?&nbsp; Could



<P>we handle that dumb thing, or would it handle us?&nbsp; I



<P>felt how big, how confoundedly big, was that thing that



<P>couldn't talk, and perhaps was deaf as well.&nbsp; What was



<P>in there?&nbsp; I could see a little ivory coming out from



<P>there, and I had heard Mr. Kurtz was in there.&nbsp; I had



<P>heard enough about it too--God knows!&nbsp; Yet somehow



<P>it didn't bring any image with it--no more than if I



<P>had been told an angel or a fiend was in there.&nbsp; I be-



<P>lieved it in the same way one of you might believe there



<P>are inhabitants in the planet Mars.&nbsp; I knew once a Scotch



<P>sailmaker who was certain, dead sure, there were people



<P>in Mars.&nbsp; If you asked him for some idea how they



<P>looked and behaved, he would get shy and mutter some-



<P>thing about 'walking on all-fours.'&nbsp; If you as much



<P>as smiled, he would--though a man of sixty--offer to



<P>fight you.&nbsp; I would not have gone so far as to fight



<P>for Kurtz, but I went for him near enough to a lie.&nbsp; You



<P>know I hate, detest, and can't bear a lie, not because



<P>I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because



<P>it appalls me.&nbsp; There is a taint of death, a flavor of



<P>mortality in lies,--which is exactly what I hate and



<P>detest in the world--what I want to forget.&nbsp; It makes



<P>me miserable and sick, like biting something rotten would



<P>do.&nbsp; Temperament, I suppose.&nbsp; Well, I went near enough



<P>to it by letting the young fool there believe anything



<P>he liked to imagine as to my influence in Europe.&nbsp; I



<P>became in an instant as much of a pretense as the rest



<P>of the bewitched pilgrims.&nbsp; This simply because I had



<P>a notion it somehow would be of help to that Kurtz whom



<P>at the time I did not see--you understand.&nbsp; He was just



<P>a word for me.&nbsp; I did not see the man in the name any



<P>more than you do.&nbsp; Do you see him?&nbsp; Do you



<P>see the story?&nbsp; Do you see anything?&nbsp; It seems to me



<P>I am trying to tell you a dream--making a vain at-



<P>tempt, because no relation of a dream can convey the



<P>dream-sensation, that commingling of absurdity, sur-



<P>prise, and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt,



<P>that notion of being captured by the incredible which is



<P>of the very essence of dreams. . . ."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was silent for a while.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>". . .&nbsp; No, it is impossible; it is impossible to convey



<P>the life-sensation of any given epoch of one's existence,



<P>--that which makes its truth, its meaning--its subtle and



<P>penetrating essence.&nbsp; It is impossible.&nbsp; We live, as we



<P>dream--alone. . . ."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He paused again as if reflecting, then added--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course in this you fellows see more than I could



<P>then.&nbsp; You see me, whom you know. . . ."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It had become so pitch dark that we listeners could



<P>hardly see one another.&nbsp; For a long time already he,



<P>sitting apart, had been no more to us than a voice.&nbsp; There



<P>was not a word from anybody.&nbsp; The others might have



<P>been asleep, but I was awake.&nbsp; I listened, I listened on



<P>the watch for the sentence, for the word, that would give



<P>me the clew to the faint uneasiness inspired by this narra-



<P>tive that seemed to shape itself without human lips in



<P>the heavy night-air of the river.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>". . .&nbsp; Yes--I let him run on," Marlow began again,



<P>"and think what he pleased about the powers that were



<P>behind me.&nbsp; I did!&nbsp; And there was nothing behind me!



<P>There was nothing but that wretched, old, mangled



<P>steamboat I was leaning against, while he talked fluently



<P>about 'the necessity for every man to get on.'&nbsp; 'And



<P>when one comes out here, you conceive, it is not to gaze



<P>at the moon.'&nbsp; Mr. Kurtz was a 'universal genius,' but



<P>even a genius would find it easier to work with 'adequate



<P>tools--intelligent men.'&nbsp; He did not make bricks--why,



<P>there was a physical impossibility in the way--as I was



<P>well aware; and if he did secretarial work for the man-



<P>ager, it was because 'no sensible man rejects wantonly



<P>the confidence of his superiors.'&nbsp; Did I see it?&nbsp; I saw it.



<P>What more did I want?&nbsp; What I really wanted was



<P>rivets, by heaven!&nbsp; Rivets.&nbsp; To get on with the work--to



<P>stop the hole.&nbsp; Rivets I wanted.&nbsp; There were cases of



<P>them down at the coast--cases--piled up--burst--split!



<P>You kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that



<P>station yard on the hillside.&nbsp; Rivets had rolled into the



<P>grove of death.&nbsp; You could fill your pockets with rivets



<P>for the trouble of stooping down--and there wasn't one



<P>rivet to be found where it was wanted.&nbsp; We had plates



<P>that would do, but nothing to fasten them with.&nbsp; And



<P>every week the messenger, a lone negro, letter-bag on



<P>shoulder and staff in hand, left our station for the coast.



<P>And several times a week a coast caravan came in with



<P>trade goods,--ghastly glazed calico that made you



<P>shudder only to look at it, glass beads value about a



<P>penny a quart, confounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs.



<P>And no rivets.&nbsp; Three carriers could have brought all



<P>that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He was becoming confidential now, but I fancy my



<P>unresponsive attitude must have exasperated him at last,



<P>for he judged it necessary to inform me he feared neither



<P>God nor devil, let alone any mere man.&nbsp; I said I could



<P>see that very well, but what I wanted was a certain



<P>quantity of rivets--and rivets were what really Mr.



<P>Kurtz wanted, if he had only known it.&nbsp; Now letters



<P>went to the coast every week. . . .&nbsp; 'My dear sir,' he



<P>cried, 'I write from dictation.'&nbsp; I demanded rivets.&nbsp; There



<P>was a way--for an intelligent man.&nbsp; He changed his



<P>manner; became very cold, and suddenly began to talk



<P>about a hippopotamus; wondered whether sleeping on



<P>board the steamer (I stuck to my salvage night and



<P>day) I wasn't disturbed.&nbsp; There was an old hippo that



<P>had the bad habit of getting out on the bank and roam-



<P>ing at night over the station grounds.&nbsp; The pilgrims



<P>used to turn out in a body and empty every rifle they



<P>could lay hands on at him.&nbsp; Some even had sat up o'



<P>nights for him.&nbsp; All this energy was wasted, though.



<P>'That animal has a charmed life,' he said; 'but you can



<P>say this only of brutes in this country.&nbsp; No man--you



<P>apprehend me?--no man here bears a charmed life.'&nbsp; He



<P>stood there for a moment in the moonlight with his deli-



<P>cate hooked nose set a little askew, and his mica eyes



<P>glittering without a wink, then, with a curt Good night,



<P>he strode off.&nbsp; I could see he was disturbed and consid-



<P>erably puzzled, which made me feel more hopeful than



<P>I had been for days.&nbsp; It was a great comfort to turn



<P>from that chap to my influential friend, the battered,



<P>twisted, ruined, tin-pot steamboat.&nbsp; I clambered on



<P>board.&nbsp; She rang under my feet like an empty Huntley



<P>&amp; Palmer biscuit-tin kicked along a gutter; she was



<P>nothing so solid in make, and rather less pretty in shape,



<P>but I had expended enough hard work on her to make



<P>me love her.&nbsp; No influential friend would have served



<P>me better.&nbsp; She had given me a chance to come out a bit



<P>--to find out what I could do.&nbsp; No, I don't like work.



<P>I had rather laze about and think of all the fine things



<P>that can be done.&nbsp; I don't like work--no man does



<P>--but I like what is in the work,--the chance to find



<P>yourself.&nbsp; Your own reality--for yourself, not for others



<P>--what no other man can ever know.&nbsp; They can only



<P>see the mere show, and never can tell what it really



<P>means.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was not surprised to see somebody sitting aft, on



<P>the deck, with his legs dangling over the mud.&nbsp; You see



<P>I rather chummed with the few mechanics there were in



<P>that station, whom the other pilgrims naturally despised



<P>--on account of their imperfect manners, I suppose.



<P>This was the foreman--a boiler-maker by trade--a good



<P>worker.&nbsp; He was a lank, bony, yellow-faced man, with



<P>big intense eyes.&nbsp; His aspect was worried, and his head



<P>was as bald as the palm of my hand; but his hair in



<P>falling seemed to have stuck to his chin, and had pros-



<P>pered in the new locality, for his beard hung down to



<P>his waist.&nbsp; He was a widower with six young children



<P>(he had left them in charge of a sister of his to come



<P>out there), and the passion of his life was pigeon-flying.



<P>He was an enthusiast and a connoisseur.&nbsp; He would rave



<P>about pigeons.&nbsp; After work hours he used sometimes to



<P>come over from his hut for a talk about his children and



<P>his pigeons; at work, when he had to crawl in the mud



<P>under the bottom of the steamboat, he would tie up that



<P>beard of his in a kind of white serviette he brought for



<P>the purpose.&nbsp; It had loops to go over his ears.&nbsp; In the



<P>evening he could be seen squatted on the bank rinsing



<P>that wrapper in the creek with great care, then spreading



<P>it solemnly on a bush to dry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I slapped him on the back and shouted 'We shall have



<P>rivets!'&nbsp; He scrambled to his feet exclaiming 'No!



<P>Rivets!' as though he couldn't believe his ears.&nbsp; Then in



<P>a low voice, 'You . . . eh?'&nbsp; I don't know why we



<P>behaved like lunatics.&nbsp; I put my finger to the side of



<P>my nose and nodded mysteriously.&nbsp; 'Good for you!' he



<P>cried, snapped his fingers above his head, lifting one



<P>foot.&nbsp; I tried a jig.&nbsp; We capered on the iron deck.&nbsp;

A



<P>frightful clatter came out of that hulk, and the virgin



<P>forest on the other bank of the creek sent it back in a



<P>thundering roll upon the sleeping station.&nbsp; It must have



<P>made some of the pilgrims sit up in their hovels.&nbsp; A



<P>dark figure obscured the lighted doorway of the man-



<P>ager's hut, vanished, then, a second or so after, the



<P>doorway itself vanished too.&nbsp; We stopped, and the silence



<P>driven away by the stamping of our feet flowed back



<P>again from the recesses of the land.&nbsp; The great wall of



<P>vegetation, an exuberant and entangled mass of trunks,



<P>branches, leaves, boughs, festoons, motionless in the



<P>moonlight, was like a rioting invasion of soundless life,



<P>a rolling wave of plants, piled up, crested, ready to



<P>topple over the creek, to sweep every little man of us



<P>out of his little existence.&nbsp; And it moved not.&nbsp; A dead-



<P>ened burst of mighty splashes and snorts reached us



<P>from afar, as though an ichthyosaurus had been taking



<P>a bath of glitter in the great river.&nbsp; 'After all,' said the



<P>boiler-maker in a reasonable tone, 'why shouldn't we get



<P>the rivets?'&nbsp; Why not, indeed!&nbsp; I did not know of any



<P>reason why we shouldn't.&nbsp; 'They'll come in three weeks,'



<P>I said confidently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But they didn't.&nbsp; Instead of rivets there came an



<P>invasion, an infliction, a visitation.&nbsp; It came in sections



<P>during the next three weeks, each section headed by a



<P>donkey carrying a white man in new clothes and tan



<P>shoes, bowing from that elevation right and left to the



<P>impressed pilgrims.&nbsp; A quarrelsome band of footsore



<P>sulky niggers trod on the heels of the donkeys; a lot of



<P>tents, camp-stools, tin boxes, white cases, brown bales



<P>would be shot down in the courtyard, and the air of



<P>mystery would deepen a little over the muddle of the



<P>station.&nbsp; Five such installments came, with their absurd



<P>air of disorderly flight with the loot of innumerable out-



<P>fit shops and provision stores, that, one would think, they



<P>were lugging, after a raid, into the wilderness for equit-



<P>able division.&nbsp; It was an inextricable mess of things



<P>decent in themselves but that human folly made look



<P>like the spoils of thieving.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"this devoted band called itself the Eldorado Ex-



<P>ploring Expedition, and I believe they were sworn to



<P>secrecy.&nbsp; Their talk, however, was the talk of sordid



<P>buccaneers: it was reckless without hardihood, greedy



<P>without audacity, and cruel without courage; there was



<P>not an atom of foresight or of serious intention in the



<P>whole batch of them, and they did not seem aware these



<P>things are wanted for the work of the world.&nbsp; To tear



<P>treasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire,



<P>with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there



<P>is in burglars breaking into a safe.&nbsp; Who paid the ex-



<P>penses of the noble enterprise I don't know; but the



<P>uncle of our manager was leader of that lot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"In exterior he resembled a butcher in a poor neigh-



<P>borhood, and his eyes had a look of sleepy cunning.&nbsp; He



<P>carried his fat paunch with ostentation on his short legs,



<P>and during the time his gang infested the station spoke



<P>to no one but his nephew.&nbsp; You could see these two roam-



<P>ing about all day long with their heads close together



<P>in an everlasting confab.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had given up worrying myself about the rivets.



<P>One's capacity for that kind of folly is more limited



<P>than you would suppose.&nbsp; I said Hang!--and let things



<P>slide.&nbsp; I had plenty of time for meditation, and now



<P>and then I would give some thought to Kurtz.&nbsp; I wasn't



<P>very interested in him.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Still, I was curious to see



<P>whether this man, who had come out equipped with moral



<P>ideas of some sort, would climb to the top after all, and



<P>how he would set about his work when there."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>"I looked at him, lost in astonishment.&nbsp; There he



<P>was before me, in motley, as though he had absconded



<P>from a troupe of mimes, enthusiastic, fabulous.&nbsp; His



<P>very existence was improbable, inexplicable, and alto-



<P>gether bewildering.&nbsp; He was an insoluble problem.&nbsp; It



<P>was inconceivable how he had existed, how he had suc-



<P>ceeded in getting so far, how he had managed to remain



<P>--why he did not instantly disappear.&nbsp; 'I went a little



<P>farther,' he said, 'then still a little farther--till I had



<P>gone so far that I don't know how I'll ever get back.



<P>Never mind.&nbsp; Plenty time.&nbsp; I can manage.&nbsp; You take



<P>Kurtz away quick--quick--I tell you.'&nbsp; The glamour of



<P>youth enveloped his particolored rags, his destitution, his



<P>loneliness, the essential desolation of his futile wander-



<P>ings.&nbsp; For months--for years--his life hadn't been



<P>worth a day's purchase; and there he was gallantly,



<P>thoughtlessly alive, to all appearance indestructible solely



<P>by the virtue of his few years and of his unreflecting



<P>audacity.&nbsp; I was seduced into something like admiration



<P>--like envy.&nbsp; Glamour urged him on, glamour kept him



<P>unscathed.&nbsp; He surely wanted nothing from the wilder-



<P>ness but space to breathe in and to push on through.



<P>His need was to exist, and to move onwards at the great-



<P>est possible risk, and with a maximum of privation.&nbsp; If



<P>the absolutely pure, uncalculating, unpractical spirit of



<P>adventure had ever ruled a human being, it ruled this



<P>be-patched youth.&nbsp; I almost envied him the possession



<P>of this modest and clear flame.&nbsp; It seemed to have con-



<P>sumed all thought of self so completely, that, even while



<P>he was talking to you, you forgot that it was he--the



<P>man before your eyes--who had gone through these



<P>things.&nbsp; I did not envy him his devotion to Kurtz,



<P>though.&nbsp; He had not meditated over it.&nbsp; It came to him,



<P>and he accepted it with a sort of eager fatalism.&nbsp; I must



<P>say that to me it appeared about the most dangerous



<P>thing in every way he had come upon so far.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They had come together unavoidably, like two ships



<P>becalmed near each other, and lay rubbing sides at last.



<P>I suppose Kurtz wanted an audience, because on a cer-



<P>tain occasion, when encamped in the forest, they had



<P>talked all night, or more probably Kurtz had talked.



<P>'We talked of everything,' he said, quite transported



<P>at the recollection.&nbsp; 'I forgot there was such a thing



<P>as sleep.&nbsp; The night did not seem to last an hour.&nbsp; Every-



<P>thing!&nbsp; Everything! . . .&nbsp; Of love too.'&nbsp; 'Ah, he



<P>talked to you of love!' I said, much amused.&nbsp; 'It isn't



<P>what you think,' he cried, almost passionately.&nbsp; 'It was



<P>in general.&nbsp; He made me see things--things.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He threw his arms up.&nbsp; We were on deck at the time,



<P>and the headman of my wood-cutters, lounging near by,



<P>turned upon him his heavy and glittering eyes.&nbsp; I looked



<P>around, and I don't know why, but I assure you that



<P>never, never before, did this land, this river, this jungle,



<P>the very arch of this blazing sky, appear to me so hope-



<P>less and so dark, so impenetrable to human thought, so



<P>pitiless to human weakness.&nbsp; 'And, ever since, you have



<P>been with him, of course?' I said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"On the contrary.&nbsp; It appears their intercourse had



<P>been very much broken by various causes.&nbsp; He had, as



<P>he informed me proudly, managed to nurse Kurtz



<P>through two illnesses (he alluded to it as you would to



<P>some risky feat), but as a rule Kurtz wandered alone,



<P>far in the depths of the forest.&nbsp; 'Very often coming to



<P>this station, I had to wait days and days before he would



<P>turn up,' he said.&nbsp; 'Ah, it was worth waiting for!--



<P>sometimes.'&nbsp; 'What was he doing? exploring or what?'



<P>I asked.&nbsp; 'Oh yes, of course;' he had discovered lots of



<P>villages, a lake too--he did not know exactly in what



<P>direction; it was dangerous to inquire too much--but



<P>mostly his expeditions had been for ivory.&nbsp; 'But he had



<P>no goods to trade with by that time,' I objected.&nbsp; 'There's



<P>a good lot of cartridges left even yet,' he answered, look-



<P>ing away.&nbsp; 'To speak plainly, he raided the country,'



<P>I said.&nbsp; He nodded.&nbsp; 'Not alone, surely!'&nbsp; He muttered



<P>something about the villages round that lake.&nbsp; 'Kurtz



<P>got the tribe to follow him, did he?' I suggested.&nbsp; He



<P>fidgeted a little.&nbsp; 'They adored him,' he said.&nbsp; The tone



<P>of these words was so extraordinary that I looked at



<P>him searchingly.&nbsp; It was curious to see his mingled eager-



<P>ness and reluctance to speak of Kurtz.&nbsp; The man filled



<P>his life, occupied his thoughts, swayed his emotions.



<P>'What can you expect?' he burst out; 'he came to them



<P>with thunder and lightning, you know--and they had



<P>never seen anything like it--and very terrible.&nbsp; He could



<P>be very terrible.&nbsp; You can't judge Mr. Kurtz as you



<P>would an ordinary man.&nbsp; No, no, no!&nbsp; Now--just to



<P>give you an idea--I don't mind telling you, he wanted



<P>to shoot me too one day--but I don't judge him.'



<P>'Shoot you!' I cried.&nbsp; 'What for?'&nbsp; 'Well, I had a



<P>small lot of ivory the chief of that village near my house



<P>gave me.&nbsp; You see I used to shoot game for them.&nbsp; Well,



<P>he wanted it, and wouldn't hear reason.&nbsp; He declared



<P>he would shoot me unless I gave him the ivory and then



<P>cleared out of the country, because he could do so, and



<P>had a fancy for it, and there was nothing on earth to



<P>prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased.&nbsp; And it



<P>was true too.&nbsp; I gave him the ivory.&nbsp; What did I care!



<P>But I didn't clear out.&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; I couldn't leave him.



<P>I had to be careful, of course, till we got friendly again



<P>for a time.&nbsp; He had his second illness then.&nbsp; Afterwards



<P>I had to keep out of the way; but I didn't mind.&nbsp; He



<P>was living for the most part in those villages on the



<P>lake.&nbsp; When he came down to the river, sometimes he



<P>would take to me, and sometimes it was better for me



<P>to be careful.&nbsp; This man suffered too much.&nbsp; He hated



<P>all this, and somehow he couldn't get away.&nbsp; When I had



<P>a chance I begged him to try and leave while there was



<P>time; I offered to go back with him.&nbsp; And he would



<P>say yes, and then he would remain; go off on another



<P>ivory hunt; disappear for weeks; forget himself amongst



<P>these people--forget himself--you know.'&nbsp; 'Why! he's



<P>mad,' I said.&nbsp; He protested indignantly.&nbsp; Mr. Kurtz



<P>couldn't be mad.&nbsp; If I had heard him talk, only two



<P>days ago, I wouldn't dare hint at such a thing. . . .



<P>I had taken up my binoculars while we talked and



<P>was looking at the shore, sweeping the limit of the



<P>forest at each side and at the back of the house.&nbsp; The



<P>consciousness of there being people in that bush, so silent,



<P>so quiet--as silent and quiet as the ruined house on the



<P>hill--made me uneasy.&nbsp; There was no sign on the face



<P>of nature of this amazing tale that was not so much



<P>told as suggested to me in desolate exclamations, com-



<P>pleted by shrugs, in interrupted phrases, in hints ending



<P>in deep sighs.&nbsp; The woods were unmoved, like a mask--



<P>heavy, like the closed door of a prison--they looked with



<P>their air of hidden knowledge, of patient expectation,



<P>of unapproachable silence.&nbsp; The Russian was explaining



<P>to me that it was only lately that Mr. Kurtz had come



<P>down to the river, bringing along with him all the fight-



<P>ing men of that lake tribe.&nbsp; He had been absent for



<P>several months--getting himself adored, I suppose--and



<P>had come down unexpectedly, with the intention to all



<P>appearance of making a raid either across the river or



<P>down stream.&nbsp; Evidently the appetite for more ivory



<P>had got the better of the--what shall I say?--less ma-



<P>terial aspirations.&nbsp; However he had got much worse



<P>suddenly.&nbsp; 'I heard he was lying helpless, and so I came



<P>up--took my chance,' said the Russian.&nbsp; 'Oh, he is



<P>bad, very bad.'&nbsp; I directed my glass to the house.&nbsp; There



<P>were no signs of life, but there was the ruined roof,



<P>the long mud wall peeping above the grass, with three



<P>little square window-holes, no two of the same size; all



<P>this brought within reach of my hand, as it were.&nbsp; And



<P>then I made a brusque movement, and one of the remain-



<P>ing posts of that vanished fence leaped up in the field



<P>of my glass.&nbsp; You remember I told you I had been



<P>struck at the distance by certain attempts at ornamenta-



<P>tion, rather remarkable in the ruinous aspect of the place.



<P>Now I had suddenly a nearer view, and its first result



<P>was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow.



<P>Then I went carefully from post to post with my glass,



<P>and I saw my mistake.&nbsp; These round knobs were not



<P>ornamental but symbolic; they were expressive and



<P>puzzling, striking and disturbing--food for thought and



<P>also for the vultures if there had been any looking down



<P>from the sky; but at all events for such ants as were



<P>industrious enough to ascend the pole.&nbsp; They would



<P>have been even more impressive, those heads on the



<P>stakes, if their faces had not been turned to the house.



<P>Only one, the first I had made out, was facing my way.



<P>I was not so shocked as you may think.&nbsp; The start back



<P>I had given was really nothing but a movement of sur-



<P>prise.&nbsp; I had expected to see a knob of wood there, you



<P>know.&nbsp; I returned deliberately to the first I had seen--



<P>and there it was, black, dried, sunken, with closed eye-



<P>lids,--a head that seemed to sleep at the top of that pole,



<P>and, with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow white



<P>line of the teeth, was smiling too, smiling continuously



<P>at some endless and jocose dream of that eternal slumber.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am not disclosing any trade secrets.&nbsp; In fact the



<P>manager said afterwards that Mr. Kurtz's methods had



<P>ruined the district.&nbsp; I have no opinion on that point,



<P>but I want you clearly to understand that there was



<P>nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there.



<P>They only showed that Mr. Kurtz lacked restraint in the



<P>gratification of his various lusts, that there was some-



<P>thing wanting in him--some small matter which, when



<P>the pressing need arose, could not be found under his



<P>magnificent eloquence.&nbsp; Whether he knew of this de-



<P>ficiency himself I can't say.&nbsp; I think the knowledge came



<P>to him at last--only at the very last.&nbsp; But the wilder-



<P>ness had found him out early, and had taken on him



<P>a terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion.&nbsp; I think



<P>it had whispered to him things about himself which he



<P>did not know, things of which he had no conception till



<P>he took counsel with this great solitude--and the whisper



<P>had proved irresistibly fascinating.&nbsp; It echoed loudly



<P>within him because he was hollow at the core. . . .&nbsp; I



<P>put down the glass, and the head that had appeared



<P>near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to have



<P>leaped away from me into inaccessible distance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The admirer of Mr. Kurtz was a bit crestfallen.&nbsp; In



<P>a hurried, indistinct voice he began to assure me he had



<P>not dared to take these--say, symbols--down.&nbsp; He was



<P>not afraid of the natives; they would not stir till Mr.



<P>Kurtz gave the word.&nbsp; His ascendency was extraor-



<P>dinary.&nbsp; The camps of these people surrounded the



<P>place, and the chiefs came every day to see him.&nbsp; They



<P>would crawl. . . .&nbsp; 'I don't want to know anything of



<P>the ceremonies used when approaching Mr. Kurtz,' I



<P>shouted.&nbsp; Curious, this feeling that came over me that



<P>such details would be more intolerable than those heads



<P>drying on the stakes under Mr. Kurtz's windows.&nbsp; After



<P>all, that was only a savage sight, while I seemed at one



<P>bound to have been transported into some lightless



<P>region of subtle horrors, where pure, uncomplicated



<P>savagery was a positive relief, being something that had



<P>a right to exist--obviously--in the sunshine.&nbsp; The



<P>young man looked at me with surprise.&nbsp; I suppose it



<P>did not occur to him Mr. Kurtz was no idol of mine.



<P>He forgot I hadn't heard any of these splendid mono-



<P>logues on, what was it? on love, justice, conduct of life



<P>--or what not.&nbsp; If it had come to crawling before Mr.



<P>Kurtz, he crawled as much as the veriest savage of them



<P>all.&nbsp; I had no idea of the conditions, he said: these heads



<P>were the heads of rebels.&nbsp; I shocked him excessively by



<P>laughing.&nbsp; Rebels!&nbsp; What would be the next definition



<P>I was to hear?&nbsp; There had been enemies, criminals, work-



<P>ers--and these were rebels.&nbsp; Those rebellious heads looked



<P>very subdued to me on their sticks.&nbsp; 'You don't know how



<P>such a life tries a man like Kurtz,' cried Kurtz's last



<P>disciple.&nbsp; 'Well, and you?' I said.&nbsp; 'I!&nbsp; I!&nbsp; I

am a



<P>simple man.&nbsp; I have no great thoughts.&nbsp; I want nothing



<P>from anybody.&nbsp; How can you compare me to . . .?"



<P>His feelings were too much for speech, and suddenly he



<P>broke down.&nbsp; 'I don't understand,' he groaned.&nbsp; 'I've



<P>been doing my best to keep him alive, and that's enough.



<P>I had no hand in all this.&nbsp; I have no abilities.&nbsp; There



<P>hasn't been a drop of medicine or a mouthful of invalid



<P>food for months here.&nbsp; He was shamefully abandoned.



<P>A man like this, with such ideas.&nbsp; Shamefully!



<P>Shamefully!&nbsp; I--I--haven't slept for the last ten



<P>nights. . . .'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"His voice lost itself in the calm of the evening.&nbsp; The



<P>long shadows of the forest had slipped down hill while



<P>we talked, had gone far beyond the ruined hovel, be-



<P>yond the symbolic row of stakes.&nbsp; All this was in the



<P>gloom, while we down there were yet in the sunshine,



<P>and the stretch of the river abreast of the clearing



<P>glittered in a still and dazzling splendor, with a murky



<P>and over-shadowed bend above and below.&nbsp; Not a living



<P>soul was seen on the shore.&nbsp; The bushes did not rustle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Suddenly round the corner of the house a group of



<P>men appeared, as though they had come up from the



<P>ground.&nbsp; They waded waist-deep in the grass, in a



<P>compact body, bearing an improvised stretcher in their



<P>midst.&nbsp; Instantly, in the emptiness of the landscape, a



<P>cry arose whose shrillness pierced the still air like a sharp



<P>arrow flying straight to the very heart of the land; and,



<P>as if by enchantment, streams of human beings--of



<P>naked human beings--with spears in their hands, with



<P>bows, with shields, with wild glances and savage move-



<P>ments, were poured into the clearing by the dark-faced



<P>and pensive forest.&nbsp; The bushes shook, the grass swayed



<P>for a time, and then everything stood still in attentive



<P>immobility.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'Now, if he does not say the right thing to them we



<P>are all done for,' said the Russian at my elbow.&nbsp; The



<P>knot of men with the stretcher had stopped too, half-way



<P>to the steamer, as if petrified.&nbsp; I saw the man on the



<P>stretcher sit up, lank and with an uplifted arm, above



<P>the shoulders of the bearers.&nbsp; 'Let us hope that the



<P>man who can talk so well of love in general will find



<P>some particular reason to spare us this time,' I said.&nbsp; I



<P>resented bitterly the absurd danger of our situation, as



<P>if to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had



<P>been a dishonoring necessity.&nbsp; I could not hear a sound,



<P>but through my glasses I saw the thin arm extended



<P>commandingly, the lower jaw moving, the eyes of that



<P>apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that



<P>nodded with grotesque jerks.&nbsp; Kurtz--Kurtz--that



<P>means short in German--don't it?&nbsp; Well, the name was



<P>as true as everything else in his life--and death.&nbsp; He



<P>looked at least seven feet long.&nbsp; His covering had fallen



<P>off, and his body emerged from it pitiful and appalling



<P>as from a winding-sheet.&nbsp; I could see the cage of his



<P>ribs all astir, the bones of his arm waving.&nbsp; It was as



<P>though an animated image of death carved out of old



<P>ivory had been shaking its hand with menaces at a



<P>motionless crowd of men made of dark and glittering



<P>bronze.&nbsp; I saw him open his mouth wide--it gave him



<P>a weirdly voracious aspect, as though he had wanted to



<P>swallow all the air, all the earth, all the men before him.



<P>A deep voice reached me faintly.&nbsp; He must have been



<P>shouting.&nbsp; He fell back suddenly.&nbsp; The stretcher shook



<P>as the bearers staggered forward again, and almost at



<P>the same time I noticed that the crowd of savages was



<P>vanishing without any perceptible movement of retreat,



<P>as if the forest that had ejected these beings so suddenly



<P>had drawn them in again as the breath is drawn in a



<P>long aspiration.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Some of the pilgrims behind the stretcher carried his



<P>arms--two shot-guns, a heavy rifle, and a light revolver-



<P>carbine--the thunderbolts of that pitiful Jupiter.&nbsp; The



<P>manager bent over him murmuring as he walked beside



<P>his head.&nbsp; They laid him down in one of the little cabins



<P>--just a room for a bed-place and a camp-stool or two,



<P>you know.&nbsp; We had brought his belated correspondence,



<P>and a lot of torn envelopes and open letters littered his



<P>bed.&nbsp; His hand roamed feebly amongst these papers.&nbsp; I



<P>was struck by the fire of his eyes and the composed



<P>languor of his expression.&nbsp; It was not so much the ex-



<P>haustion of disease.&nbsp; He did not seem in pain.&nbsp; This



<P>shadow looked satiated and calm, as though for the



<P>moment it had had its fill of all the emotions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He rustled one of the letters, and looking straight



<P>in my face said, 'I am glad.'&nbsp; Somebody had been writ-



<P>ing to him about me.&nbsp; These special recommendations



<P>were turning up again.&nbsp; The volume of tone he emitted



<P>without effort, almost without the trouble of moving his



<P>lips, amazed me.&nbsp; A voice! a voice!&nbsp; It was grave, pro-



<P>found, vibrating, while the man did not seem capable



<P>of a whisper.&nbsp; However, he had enough strength in



<P>him--factitious no doubt--to very nearly make an end



<P>of us, as you shall hear directly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The manager appeared silently in the doorway; I



<P>stepped out at once and he drew the curtain after me.



<P>The Russian, eyed curiously by the pilgrims, was star-



<P>ing at the shore.&nbsp; I followed the direction of his glance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dark human shapes could be made out in the distance,



<P>flitting indistinctly against the gloomy border of the



<P>forest, and near the river two bronze figures, leaning



<P>on tall spears, stood in the sunlight under fantastic head-



<P>dresses of spotted skins, warlike and still in statuesque



<P>repose.&nbsp; And from right to left along the lighted shore



<P>moved a wild and gorgeous apparition of a woman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She walked with measured steps, draped in striped



<P>and fringed cloths, treading the earth proudly, with a



<P>slight jingle and flash of barbarous ornaments.&nbsp; She



<P>carried her head high; her hair was done in the shape



<P>of a helmet; she had brass leggings to the knee, brass



<P>wire gauntlets to the elbow, a crimson spot on her tawny



<P>cheek, innumerable necklaces of glass beads on her neck;



<P>bizarre things, charms, gifts of witch-men, that hung



<P>about her, glittered and trembled at every step.&nbsp; She



<P>must have had the value of several elephant tusks upon



<P>her.&nbsp; She was savage and superb, wild-eyed and magnifi-



<P>cent; there was something ominous and stately in her



<P>deliberate progress.&nbsp; And in the hush that had fallen



<P>suddenly upon the whole sorrowful land, the immense



<P>wilderness, the colossal body of the fecund and mys-



<P>terious life seemed to look at her, pensive, as though it



<P>had been looking at the image of its own tenebrous and



<P>passionate soul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She came abreast of the steamer, stood still, and faced



<P>us.&nbsp; Her long shadow fell to the water's edge.&nbsp; Her face



<P>had a tragic and fierce aspect of wild sorrow and of



<P>dumb pain mingled with the fear of some struggling,



<P>half-shaped resolve.&nbsp; She stood looking at us without



<P>a stir and like the wilderness itself, with an air of brood-



<P>ing over an inscrutable purpose.&nbsp; A whole minute passed,



<P>and then she made a step forward.&nbsp; There was a low



<P>jingle, a glint of yellow metal, a sway of fringed draper-



<P>ies, and she stopped as if her heart had failed her.&nbsp; The



<P>young fellow by my side growled.&nbsp; The pilgrims mur-



<P>mured at my back.&nbsp; She looked at us all as if her life



<P>had depended upon the unswerving steadiness of her



<P>glance.&nbsp; Suddenly she opened her bared arms and threw



<P>them up rigid above her head, as though in an uncon-



<P>trollable desire to touch the sky, and at the same time



<P>the swift shadows darted out on the earth, swept around



<P>on the river, gathering the steamer into a shadowy em-



<P>brace.&nbsp; A formidable silence hung over the scene.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She turned away slowly, walked on, following the



<P>bank, and passed into the bushes to the left.&nbsp; Once only



<P>her eyes gleamed back at us in the dusk of the thickets



<P>before she disappeared.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'If she had offered to come aboard I really think I



<P>would have tried to shoot her,' said the man of patches,



<P>nervously.&nbsp; 'I had been risking my life every day for



<P>the last fortnight to keep her out of the house.&nbsp; She



<P>got in one day and kicked up a row about those miser-



<P>able rags I picked up in the storeroom to mend my clothes



<P>with.&nbsp; I wasn't decent.&nbsp; At least it must have been that,



<P>for she talked like a fury to Kurtz for an hour, point-



<P>ing at me now and then.&nbsp; I don't understand the dia-



<P>lect of this tribe.&nbsp; Luckily for me, I fancy Kurtz felt



<P>too ill that day to care, or there would have been mis-



<P>chief.&nbsp; I don't understand. . . .&nbsp; No--it's too much



<P>for me.&nbsp; Ah, well, it's all over now.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"At this moment I heard Kurtz's deep voice behind



<P>the curtain, 'Save me!--save the ivory, you mean.&nbsp; Don't



<P>tell me.&nbsp; Save ME!&nbsp; Why, I've had to save you.&nbsp; You



<P>are interrupting my plans now.&nbsp; Sick!&nbsp; Sick!&nbsp; Not so



<P>sick as you would like to believe.&nbsp; Never mind.&nbsp; I'll



<P>carry my ideas out yet--I will return.&nbsp; I'll show you



<P>what can be done.&nbsp; You with your little peddling no-



<P>tions--you are interfering with me.&nbsp; I will return.



<P>I . . .'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The manager came out.&nbsp; He did me the honor to



<P>take me under the arm and lead me aside.&nbsp; 'He is very



<P>low, very low,' he said.&nbsp; He considered it necessary to



<P>sigh, but neglected to be consistently sorrowful.&nbsp; 'We



<P>have done all we could for him--haven't we?&nbsp; But there



<P>is no disguising the fact, Mr. Kurtz has done more



<P>harm than good to the Company.&nbsp; He did not see the



<P>time was not ripe for vigorous action.&nbsp; Cautiously, cau-



<P>tiously--that's my principle.&nbsp; We must be cautious yet.



<P>The district is closed to us for a time.&nbsp; Deplorable!&nbsp; Upon



<P>the whole, the trade will suffer.&nbsp; I don't deny there is



<P>a remarkable quantity of ivory--mostly fossil.&nbsp; We must



<P>save it, at all events--but look how precarious the posi-



<P>tion is--and why?&nbsp; Because the method is unsound.'



<P>'Do you,' said I, looking at the shore, 'call it "unsound



<P>method"?'&nbsp; 'Without doubt,' he exclaimed, hotly.



<P>'Don't you?' . . .&nbsp; 'No method at all,' I murmured



<P>after a while.&nbsp; 'Exactly,' he exulted.&nbsp; 'I anticipated



<P>this.&nbsp; Shows a complete want of judgment.&nbsp; It is my



<P>duty to point it out in the proper quarter.'&nbsp; 'Oh,' said



<P>I, 'that fellow--what's his name?--the brickmaker, will



<P>make a readable report for you.'&nbsp; He appeared con-



<P>founded for a moment.&nbsp; It seemed to me I had never



<P>breathed an atmosphere so vile, and I turned mentally



<P>to Kurtz for relief--positively for relief.&nbsp; 'Neverthe-



<P>less I think Mr. Kurtz is a remarkable man,' I said with



<P>emphasis.&nbsp; He started, dropped on me a cold heavy



<P>glance, said very quietly, 'He WAS,' and turned his back



<P>on me.&nbsp; My hour of favor was over; I found myself



<P>lumped along with Kurtz as a partisan of methods for



<P>which the time was not ripe: I was unsound!&nbsp; Ah! but it



<P>was something to have at least a choice of nightmares.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had turned to the wilderness really, not to Mr.



<P>Kurtz, who, I was ready to admit, was as good as buried.



<P>And for a moment it seemed to me as if I also were



<P>buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets.&nbsp; I



<P>felt an intolerable weight oppressing my breast, the



<P>smell of the damp earth, the unseen presence of victorious



<P>corruption, the darkness of an impenetrable night. . . .



<P>The Russian tapped me on the shoulder.&nbsp; I heard him



<P>mumbling and stammering something about 'brother



<P>seaman--couldn't conceal--knowledge of matters that



<P>would affect Mr. Kurtz's reputation.'&nbsp; I waited.&nbsp; For



<P>him evidently Mr. Kurtz was not in his grave; I suspect



<P>that for him Mr. Kurtz was one of the immortals.



<P>'Well!' said I at last, 'speak out.&nbsp; As it happens, I am



<P>Mr. Kurtz's friend--in a way.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He stated with a good deal of formality that had



<P>we not been 'of the same profession,' he would have



<P>kept the matter to himself without regard to conse-



<P>quences.&nbsp; 'He suspected there was an active ill-will to-



<P>wards him on the part of these white men that--'



<P>'You are right,' I said, remembering a certain conversa-



<P>tion I had overheard.&nbsp; 'The manager thinks you ought



<P>to be hanged.'&nbsp; He showed a concern at this intelligence



<P>which amused me at first.&nbsp; 'I had better get out of the



<P>way quietly,' he said, earnestly.&nbsp; 'I can do no more for



<P>Kurtz now, and they would soon find some excuse.



<P>What's to stop them?&nbsp; There's a military post three hun-



<P>dred miles from here.'&nbsp; 'Well, upon my word,' said I,



<P>'perhaps you had better go if you have any friends



<P>amongst the savages near by.'&nbsp; 'Plenty,' he said.&nbsp; 'They



<P>are simple people--and I want nothing, you know.'



<P>He stood biting his lips, then: 'I don't want any harm to



<P>happen to these whites here, but of course I was think-



<P>ing of Mr. Kurtz's reputation--but you are a brother



<P>seaman and--'&nbsp; 'All right,' said I, after a time.



<P>'Mr. Kurtz's reputation is safe with me.'&nbsp; I did not



<P>know how truly I spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He informed me, lowering his voice, that it was



<P>Kurtz who had ordered the attack to be made on the



<P>steamer.&nbsp; 'He hated sometimes the idea of being taken



<P>away--and then again. . . .&nbsp; But I don't understand



<P>these matters.&nbsp; I am a simple man.&nbsp; He thought it would



<P>scare you away--that you would give it up, thinking



<P>him dead.&nbsp; I could not stop him.&nbsp; Oh, I had an awful



<P>time of it this last month.'&nbsp; 'Very well,' I said.&nbsp; 'He is



<P>all right now.'&nbsp; 'Ye-e-es,' he muttered, not very con-



<P>vinced apparently.&nbsp; 'Thanks,' said I; 'I shall keep my



<P>eyes open.'&nbsp; 'But quiet--eh?' he urged, anxiously.&nbsp; 'It



<P>would be awful for his reputation if anybody here--'



<P>I promised a complete discretion with great gravity.&nbsp; 'I



<P>have a canoe and three black fellows waiting not very



<P>far.&nbsp; I am off.&nbsp; Could you give me a few Martini-Henry



<P>cartridges?'&nbsp; I could, and did, with proper secrecy.&nbsp; He



<P>helped himself, with a wink at me, to a handful of my



<P>tobacco.&nbsp; 'Between sailors--you know--good English



<P>tobacco.'&nbsp; At the door of the pilot-house he turned round



<P>--'I say, haven't you a pair of shoes you could spare?'



<P>He raised one leg.&nbsp; 'Look.'&nbsp; The soles were tied with



<P>knotted strings sandal-wise under his bare feet.&nbsp; I rooted



<P>out an old pair, at which he looked with admiration be-



<P>fore tucking it under his left arm.&nbsp; One of his pockets



<P>(bright red) was bulging with cartridges, from the



<P>other (dark blue) peeped 'Towson's Inquiry,' &amp;c., &amp;c.



<P>He seemed to think himself excellently well equipped



<P>for a renewed encounter with the wilderness.&nbsp; 'Ah!&nbsp; I'll



<P>never, never meet such a man again.&nbsp; You ought to



<P>have heard him recite poetry--his own too it was, he told



<P>me.&nbsp; Poetry!'&nbsp; He rolled his eyes at the recollection



<P>of these delights.&nbsp; 'Oh, he enlarged my mind!'&nbsp; 'Good-



<P>by,' said I.&nbsp; He shook hands and vanished in the night.



<P>Sometimes I ask myself whether I had ever really seen



<P>him--whether it was possible to meet such a phenome-



<P>non! . . .

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When I woke up shortly after midnight his warning



<P>came to my mind with its hint of danger that seemed,



<P>in the starred darkness, real enough to make me get



<P>up for the purpose of having a look round.&nbsp; On the



<P>hill a big fire burned, illuminating fitfully a crooked



<P>corner of the station-house.&nbsp; One of the agents with



<P>a picket of a few of our blacks, armed for the purpose,



<P>was keeping guard over the ivory; but deep within the



<P>forest, red gleams that wavered, that seemed to sink and



<P>rise from the ground amongst confused columnar shapes



<P>of intense blackness, showed the exact position of the



<P>camp where Mr. Kurtz's adorers were keeping their un-



<P>easy vigil.&nbsp; The monotonous beating of a big drum filled



<P>the air with muffled shocks and a lingering vibration.&nbsp; A



<P>steady droning sound of many men chanting each to



<P>himself some weird incantation came out from the black,



<P>flat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes



<P>out of a hive, and had a strange narcotic effect upon



<P>my half-awake senses.&nbsp; I believe I dozed off leaning



<P>over the rail, till an abrupt burst of yells, an over-



<P>whelming outbreak of a pent-up and mysterious frenzy,



<P>woke me up in a bewildered wonder.&nbsp; It was cut short



<P>all at once, and the low droning went on with an effect



<P>of audible and soothing silence.&nbsp; I glanced casually into



<P>the little cabin.&nbsp; A light was burning within, but Mr.



<P>Kurtz was not there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think I would have raised an outcry if I had be-



<P>lieved my eyes.&nbsp; But I didn't believe them at first--the



<P>thing seemed so impossible.&nbsp; The fact is I was completely



<P>unnerved by a sheer blank fright, pure abstract terror,



<P>unconnected with any distinct shape of physical danger.



<P>What made this emotion so overpowering was--how shall



<P>I define it?--the moral shock I received, as if something



<P>altogether monstrous, intolerable to thought and odious



<P>to the soul, had been thrust upon me unexpectedly.&nbsp; This



<P>lasted of course the merest fraction of a second, and



<P>then the usual sense of commonplace, deadly danger, the



<P>possibility of a sudden onslaught and massacre, or some-



<P>thing of the kind, which I saw impending, was positively



<P>welcome and composing.&nbsp; It pacified me, in fact, so



<P>much, that I did not raise an alarm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There was an agent buttoned up inside an ulster



<P>and sleeping on a chair on deck within three feet of



<P>e.&nbsp; The yells had not awakened him; he snored very



<P>slightly; I left him to his slumbers and leaped ashore.



<P>I did not betray Mr. Kurtz--it was ordered I should



<P>never betray him--it was written I should be loyal to



<P>the nightmare of my choice.&nbsp; I was anxious to deal



<P>with this shadow by myself alone,--and to this day I



<P>don't know why I was so jealous of sharing with any-



<P>one the peculiar blackness of that experience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As soon as I got on the bank I saw a trail--a broad



<P>trail through the grass.&nbsp; I remember the exultation with



<P>which I said to myself, 'He can't walk--he is crawling



<P>on all-fours--I've got him.'&nbsp; The grass was wet with



<P>dew.&nbsp; I strode rapidly with clenched fists.&nbsp; I fancy I



<P>had some vague notion of falling upon him and giving



<P>him a drubbing.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; I had some imbecile



<P>thoughts.&nbsp; The knitting old woman with the cat ob-



<P>truded herself upon my memory as a most improper



<P>person to be sitting at the other end of such an affair.



<P>I saw a row of pilgrims squirting lead in the air out



<P>of Winchesters held to the hip.&nbsp; I thought I would



<P>never get back to the steamer, and imagined myself



<P>living alone and unarmed in the woods to an advanced



<P>age.&nbsp; Such silly things--you know.&nbsp; And I remember



<P>I confounded the beat of the drum with the beating of



<P>my heart, and was pleased at its calm regularity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I kept to the track though--then stopped to listen.



<P>The night was very clear: a dark blue space, sparkling



<P>with dew and starlight, in which black things stood



<P>very still.&nbsp; I thought I could see a kind of motion ahead



<P>of me.&nbsp; I was strangely cocksure of everything that



<P>night.&nbsp; I actually left the track and ran in a wide semi-



<P>circle (I verily believe chuckling to myself) so as to



<P>get in front of that stir, of that motion I had seen--



<P>if indeed I had seen anything.&nbsp; I was circumventing



<P>Kurtz as though it had been a boyish game.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I came upon him, and, if he had not heard me coming,



<P>I would have fallen over him too, but he got up in



<P>time.&nbsp; He rose, unsteady, long, pale, indistinct, like a



<P>vapor exhaled by the earth, and swayed slightly, misty



<P>and silent before me; while at my back the fires loomed



<P>between the trees, and the murmur of many voices issued



<P>from the forest.&nbsp; I had cut him off cleverly; but when



<P>actually confronting him I seemed to come to my senses,



<P>I saw the danger in its right proportion.&nbsp; It was by



<P>no means over yet.&nbsp; Suppose he began to shout?&nbsp; Though



<P>he could hardly stand, there was still plenty of vigor



<P>in his voice.&nbsp; 'Go away--hide yourself,' he said, in that



<P>profound tone.&nbsp; It was very awful.&nbsp; I glanced back.



<P>We were within thirty yards from the nearest fire.&nbsp; A



<P>black figure stood up, strode on long black legs, waving



<P>long black arms, across the glow.&nbsp; It had horns--ante-



<P>lope horns, I think--on its head.&nbsp; Some sorcerer, some



<P>witch-man, no doubt: it looked fiend-like enough.&nbsp; 'Do



<P>you know what you are doing?' I whispered.&nbsp; 'Per-



<P>fectly,' he answered, raising his voice for that single



<P>word: it sounded to me far off and yet loud, like a hail



<P>through a speaking-trumpet.&nbsp; If he makes a row we



<P>are lost, I thought to myself.&nbsp; This clearly was not a



<P>case for fisticuffs, even apart from the very natural



<P>aversion I had to beat that Shadow--this wandering and



<P>tormented thing.&nbsp; 'You will be lost,' I said--'utterly



<P>lost.'&nbsp; One gets sometimes such a flash of inspiration,



<P>you know.&nbsp; I did say the right thing, though indeed



<P>he could not have been more irretrievably lost than he



<P>was at this very moment, when the foundations of our



<P>intimacy were being laid--to endure--to endure--even



<P>to the end--even beyond.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'I had immense plans,' he muttered irresolutely.



<P>'Yes,' said I; 'but if you try to shout I'll smash your



<P>head with--' there was not a stick or a stone near.&nbsp; 'I



<P>will throttle you for good,' I corrected myself.&nbsp; 'I was



<P>on the threshold of great things,' he pleaded, in a voice



<P>of longing, with a wistfulness of tone that made my



<P>blood run cold.&nbsp; 'And now for this stupid scoundrel--'



<P>'Your success in Europe is assured in any case,' I af-



<P>firmed, steadily.&nbsp; I did not want to have the throttling



<P>of him, you understand--and indeed it would have been



<P>very little use for any practical purpose.&nbsp; I tried to



<P>break the spell--the heavy, mute spell of the wilder-



<P>ness--that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by



<P>the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the



<P>memory of gratified and monstrous passions.&nbsp; This alone,



<P>I was convinced, had driven him out to the edge of the



<P>forest, to the bush, towards the gleam of fires, the throb



<P>of drums, the drone of weird incantations; this alone



<P>had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of



<P>permitted aspirations.&nbsp; And, don't you see, the terror



<P>of the position was not in being knocked on the head



<P>--though I had a very lively sense of that danger too



<P>--but in this, that I had to deal with a being to whom



<P>I could not appeal in the name of anything high or low.



<P>I had, even like the niggers, to invoke him--himself--



<P>his own exalted and incredible degradation.&nbsp; There was



<P>nothing either above or below him, and I knew it.&nbsp; He



<P>had kicked himself loose of the earth.&nbsp; Confound the



<P>man! he had kicked the very earth to pieces.&nbsp; He was



<P>alone, and I before him did not know whether I stood



<P>on the ground or floated in the air.&nbsp; I've been telling



<P>you what we said--repeating the phrases we pronounced,



<P>--but what's the good?&nbsp; They were common everyday



<P>words,--the familiar, vague sounds exchanged on every



<P>waking day of life.&nbsp; But what of that?&nbsp; They had be-



<P>hind them, to my mind, the terrific suggestiveness of



<P>words heard in dreams, of phrases spoken in night-



<P>mares.&nbsp; Soul!&nbsp; If anybody had ever struggled with a



<P>soul, I am the man.&nbsp; And I wasn't arguing with a luna-



<P>tic either.&nbsp; Believe me or not, his intelligence was per-



<P>fectly clear--concentrated, it is true, upon himself with



<P>horrible intensity, yet clear; and therein was my only



<P>chance--barring, of course, the killing him there and



<P>then, which wasn't so good, on account of unavoidable



<P>noise.&nbsp; But his soul was mad.&nbsp; Being alone in the wilder-



<P>ness, it had looked within itself, and, by heavens! I tell



<P>you, it had gone mad.&nbsp; I had--for my sins, I suppose--



<P>to go through the ordeal of looking into it myself.&nbsp; No



<P>eloquence could have been so withering to one's belief



<P>in mankind as his final burst of sincerity.&nbsp; He struggled



<P>with himself, too.&nbsp; I saw it,--I heard it.&nbsp; I saw the in-



<P>conceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint, no



<P>faith, and no fear, yet struggling blindly with itself.&nbsp; I



<P>kept my head pretty well; but when I had him at last



<P>stretched on the couch, I wiped my forehead, while my



<P>legs shook under me as though I had carried half a



<P>ton on my back down that hill.&nbsp; And yet I had only



<P>supported him, his bony arm clasped round my neck



<P>--and he was not much heavier than a child.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When next day we left at noon, the crowd, of whose



<P>presence behind the curtain of trees I had been acutely



<P>conscious all the time, flowed out of the woods again,



<P>filled the clearing, covered the slope with a mass of naked,



<P>breathing, quivering, bronze bodies.&nbsp; I steamed up a



<P>bit, then swung down-stream, and two thousand eyes



<P>followed the evolutions of the splashing, thumping,



<P>fierce river-demon beating the water with its terrible tail



<P>and breathing black smoke into the air.&nbsp; In front of



<P>the first rank, along the river, three men, plastered with



<P>bright red earth from head to foot, strutted to and fro



<P>restlessly.&nbsp; When we came abreast again, they faced the



<P>river, stamped their feet, nodded their horned heads,



<P>swayed their scarlet bodies; they shook towards the fierce



<P>river-demon a bunch of black feathers, a mangy skin



<P>with a pendent tail--something that looked like a dried



<P>gourd; they shouted periodically together strings of



<P>amazing words that resembled no sounds of human lan-



<P>guage; and the deep murmurs of the crowd, inter-



<P>rupted suddenly, were like the response of some satanic



<P>litany.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We had carried Kurtz into the pilot-house: there was



<P>more air there.&nbsp; Lying on the couch, he stared through



<P>the open shutter.&nbsp; There was an eddy in the mass of



<P>human bodies, and the woman with helmeted head and



<P>tawny cheeks rushed out to the very brink of the stream.



<P>She put out her hands, shouted something, and all that



<P>wild mob took up the shout in a roaring chorus of



<P>articulated, rapid, breathless utterance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'Do you understand this?' I asked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He kept on looking out past me with fiery, longing



<P>eyes, with a mingled expression of wistfulness and hate.



<P>He made no answer, but I saw a smile, a smile of inde-



<P>finable meaning, appear on his colorless lips that a mo-



<P>ment after twitched convulsively.&nbsp; 'Do I not?' he said



<P>slowly, gasping, as if the words had been torn out of



<P>him by a supernatural power.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I pulled the string of the whistle, and I did this



<P>because I saw the pilgrims on deck getting out their



<P>rifles with an air of anticipating a jolly lark.&nbsp; At the



<P>sudden screech there was a movement of abject terror



<P>through that wedged mass of bodies.&nbsp; 'Don't! don't!



<P>you frighten them away,' cried someone on deck dis-



<P>consolately.&nbsp; I pulled the string time after time.&nbsp; They



<P>broke and ran, they leaped, they crouched, they swerved,



<P>they dodged the flying terror of the sound.&nbsp; The three



<P>red chaps had fallen flat, face down on the shore, as



<P>though they had been shot dead.&nbsp; Only the barbarous



<P>and superb woman did not so much as flinch, and



<P>stretched tragically her bare arms after us over the



<P>somber and glittering river.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And then that imbecile crowd down on the deck



<P>started their little fun, and I could see nothing more



<P>for smoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of



<P>darkness, bearing us down towards the sea with twice



<P>the speed of our upward progress; and Kurtz's life was



<P>running swiftly too, ebbing, ebbing out of his heart



<P>into the sea of inexorable time.&nbsp; The manager was very



<P>placid, he had no vital anxieties now, he took us both



<P>in with a comprehensive and satisfied glance: the 'affair'



<P>had come off as well as could be wished.&nbsp; I saw the time



<P>approaching when I would be left alone of the party of



<P>'unsound method.'&nbsp; The pilgrims looked upon me with



<P>disfavor.&nbsp; I was, so to speak, numbered with the dead.



<P>It is strange how I accepted this unforeseen partner-



<P>ship, this choice of nightmares forced upon me in the



<P>tenebrous land invaded by these mean and greedy phan-



<P>toms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Kurtz discoursed.&nbsp; A voice! a voice!&nbsp; It rang deep



<P>to the very last.&nbsp; It survived his strength to hide in



<P>the magnificent folds of eloquence the barren darkness



<P>of his heart.&nbsp; Oh, he struggled! he struggled!&nbsp; The



<P>wastes of his weary brain were haunted by shadowy



<P>images now--images of wealth and fame revolving



<P>obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of noble



<P>and lofty expression.&nbsp; My Intended, my station, my



<P>career, my ideas--these were the subjects for the occa-



<P>sional utterances of elevated sentiments.&nbsp; The shade of



<P>the original Kurtz frequented the bedside of the hollow



<P>sham, whose fate it was to be buried presently in the



<P>mold of primeval earth.&nbsp; But both the diabolic love and



<P>the unearthly hate of the mysteries it had penetrated



<P>fought for the possession of that soul satiated with



<P>primitive emotions, avid of lying fame, of sham dis-



<P>tinction, of all the appearances of success and power.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sometimes he was contemptibly childish.&nbsp; He desired



<P>to have kings meet him at railway-stations on his return



<P>from some ghastly Nowhere, where he intended to ac-



<P>complish great things.&nbsp; 'You show them you have in



<P>you something that is really profitable, and then there



<P>will be no limits to the recognition of your ability,' he



<P>would say.&nbsp; 'Of course you must take care of the mo-



<P>tives--right motives--always.'&nbsp; The long reaches that



<P>were like one and the same reach, monotonous bends that



<P>were exactly alike, slipped past the steamer with their



<P>multitude of secular trees looking patiently after this



<P>grimy fragment of another world, the forerunner of



<P>change, of conquest, of trade, of massacres, of blessings.



<P>I looked ahead--piloting.&nbsp; 'Close the shutter,' said



<P>Kurtz suddenly one day; 'I can't bear to look at this.'



<P>I did so.&nbsp; There was a silence.&nbsp; 'Oh, but I will wring



<P>your heart yet!' he cried at the invisible wilderness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We broke down--as I had expected--and had to lie



<P>up for repairs at the head of an island.&nbsp; This delay



<P>was the first thing that shook Kurtz's confidence.&nbsp; One



<P>morning he gave me a packet of papers and a photo-



<P>graph,--the lot tied together with a shoe-string.&nbsp; 'Keep



<P>this for me,' he said.&nbsp; 'This noxious fool' (meaning



<P>the manager) 'is capable of prying into my boxes when



<P>I am not looking.'&nbsp; In the afternoon I saw him.&nbsp; He



<P>was lying on his back with closed eyes, and I withdrew



<P>quietly, but I heard him mutter, 'Live rightly, die,



<P>die . . .'&nbsp; I listened.&nbsp; There was nothing more.&nbsp; Was



<P>he rehearsing some speech in his sleep, or was it a frag-



<P>ment of a phrase from some newspaper article?&nbsp; He had



<P>been writing for the papers and meant to do so again,



<P>'for the furthering of my ideas.&nbsp; It's a duty.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"His was an impenetrable darkness.&nbsp; I looked at him



<P>as you peer down at a man who is lying at the bottom



<P>of a precipice where the sun never shines.&nbsp; But I had



<P>not much time to give him, because I was helping the



<P>engine-driver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders, to



<P>straighten a bent connecting-rod, and in other such



<P>matters.&nbsp; I lived in an infernal mess of rust, filings,



<P>nuts, bolts, spanners, hammers, ratchet-drills--things I



<P>abominate, because I don't get on with them.&nbsp; I tended



<P>the little forge we fortunately had aboard; I toiled



<P>wearily in a wretched scrap-heap--unless I had the



<P>shakes too bad to stand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"One evening coming in with a candle I was startled



<P>to hear him say a little tremulously, 'I am lying here



<P>in the dark waiting for death.'&nbsp; The light was within



<P>a foot of his eyes.&nbsp; I forced myself to murmur, 'Oh,



<P>nonsense!' and stood over him as if transfixed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Anything approaching the change that came over



<P>his features I have never seen before, and hope never



<P>to see again.&nbsp; Oh, I wasn't touched.&nbsp; I was fascinated.



<P>It was as though a veil had been rent.&nbsp; I saw on that



<P>ivory face the expression of somber pride, of ruthless



<P>power, of craven terror--of an intense and hopeless



<P>despair.&nbsp; Did he live his life again in every detail of



<P>desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme



<P>moment of complete knowledge?&nbsp; He cried in a whisper



<P>at some image, at some vision,--he cried out twice, a



<P>cry that was no more than a breath--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'The horror!&nbsp; The horror!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I blew the candle out and left the cabin.&nbsp; The pil-



<P>grims were dining in the mess-room, and I took my



<P>place opposite the manager, who lifted his eyes to give



<P>me a questioning glance, which I successfully ignored.



<P>He leaned back, serene, with that peculiar smile of his



<P>sealing the unexpressed depths of his meanness.&nbsp; A con-



<P>tinuous shower of small flies streamed upon the lamp,



<P>upon the cloth, upon our hands and faces.&nbsp; Suddenly



<P>the manager's boy put his insolent black head in the



<P>doorway, and said in a tone of scathing contempt--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'Mistah Kurtz--he dead.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All the pilgrims rushed out to see.&nbsp; I remained, and



<P>went on with my dinner.&nbsp; I believe I was considered



<P>brutally callous.&nbsp; However, I did not eat much.&nbsp; There



<P>was a lamp in there--light, don't you know--and outside



<P>it was so beastly, beastly dark.&nbsp; I went no more near



<P>the remarkable man who had pronounced a judgment



<P>upon the adventures of his soul on this earth.&nbsp; The



<P>voice was gone.&nbsp; What else had been there?&nbsp; But I am



<P>of course aware that next day the pilgrims buried some-



<P>thing in a muddy hole.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And then they very nearly buried me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"However, as you see, I did not go to join Kurtz



<P>there and then.&nbsp; I did not.&nbsp; I remained to dream the



<P>nightmare out to the end, and to show my loyalty to



<P>Kurtz once more.&nbsp; Destiny.&nbsp; My destiny!&nbsp; Droll thing



<P>life is--that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic



<P>for a futile purpose.&nbsp; The most you can hope from it



<P>is some knowledge of yourself--that comes too late--a



<P>crop of unextinguishable regrets.&nbsp; I have wrestled with



<P>death.&nbsp; It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine.



<P>It takes place in an impalpable grayness, with nothing



<P>underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators,



<P>without clamor, without glory, without the great desire



<P>of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly



<P>atmosphere of tepid skepticism, without much belief in



<P>your own right, and still less in that of your adversary.



<P>If such is the form of ultimate wisdom, then life is a



<P>greater riddle than some of us think it to be.&nbsp; I was



<P>within a hair's-breadth of the last opportunity for pro-



<P>nouncement, and I found with humiliation that probably



<P>I would have nothing to say.&nbsp; This is the reason why I



<P>affirm that Kurtz was a remarkable man.&nbsp; He had some-



<P>thing to say.&nbsp; He said it.&nbsp; Since I had peeped over the



<P>edge myself, I understand better the meaning of his



<P>stare, that could not see the flame of the candle, but was



<P>wide enough to embrace the whole universe, piercing



<P>enough to penetrate all the hearts that beat in the dark-



<P>ness.&nbsp; He had summed up--he had judged.&nbsp; 'The



<P>horror!'&nbsp; He was a remarkable man.&nbsp; After all, this



<P>was the expression of some sort of belief; it had candor,



<P>it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its



<P>whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth



<P>--the strange commingling of desire and hate.&nbsp; And it



<P>is not my own extremity I remember best--a vision of



<P>grayness without form filled with physical pain, and a



<P>careless contempt for the evanescence of all things--even



<P>of this pain itself.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; It is his extremity that I seem



<P>to have lived through.&nbsp; True, he had made that last



<P>stride, he had stepped over the edge, while I had been



<P>permitted to draw back my hesitating foot.&nbsp; And per-



<P>haps in this is the whole difference; perhaps all the wis-



<P>dom, and all truth, and all sincerity, are just compressed



<P>into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step



<P>over the threshold of the invisible.&nbsp; Perhaps!&nbsp; I like to



<P>think my summing-up would not have been a word of



<P>careless contempt.&nbsp; Better his cry--much better.&nbsp; It was



<P>an affirmation, a moral victory paid for by innumerable



<P>defeats, by abominable terrors, by abominable satisfac-



<P>tions.&nbsp; But it was a victory!&nbsp; That is why I have re-



<P>mained loyal to Kurtz to the last, and even beyond,



<P>when a long time after I heard once more, not his own



<P>voice, but the echo of his magnificent eloquence thrown



<P>to me from a soul as translucently pure as a cliff of



<P>crystal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, they did not bury me, though there is a period



<P>of time which I remember mistily, with a shuddering



<P>wonder, like a passage through some inconceivable world



<P>that had no hope in it and no desire.&nbsp; I found myself



<P>back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people



<P>hurrying through the streets to filch a little money from



<P>each other, to devour their infamous cookery, to gulp



<P>their unwholesome beer, to dream their insignificant and



<P>silly dreams.&nbsp; They trespassed upon my thoughts.&nbsp; They



<P>were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an



<P>irritating pretense, because I felt so sure they could



<P>not possibly know the things I knew.&nbsp; Their bearing,



<P>which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals



<P>going about their business in the assurance of perfect



<P>safety, was offensive to me like the outrageous flaunt-



<P>ings of folly in the face of a danger it is unable to



<P>comprehend.&nbsp; I had no particular desire to enlighten



<P>them, but I had some difficulty in restraining myself



<P>from laughing in their faces, so full of stupid impor-



<P>tance.&nbsp; I dare say I was not very well at that time.&nbsp; I



<P>tottered about the streets--there were various affairs to



<P>settle--grinning bitterly at perfectly respectable per-



<P>sons.&nbsp; I admit my behavior was inexcusable, but then my



<P>temperature was seldom normal in these days.&nbsp; My dear



<P>aunt's endeavors to 'nurse up my strength' seemed alto-



<P>gether beside the mark.&nbsp; It was not my strength that



<P>wanted nursing, it was my imagination that wanted



<P>soothing.&nbsp; I kept the bundle of papers given me by



<P>Kurtz, not knowing exactly what to do with it.&nbsp; His



<P>mother had died lately, watched over, as I was told, by



<P>his Intended.&nbsp; A clean-shaved man, with an official



<P>manner and wearing gold-rimmed spectacles, called on



<P>me one day and made inquiries, at first circuitous, after-



<P>wards suavely pressing, about what he was pleased to



<P>denominate certain 'documents.'&nbsp; I was not surprised,



<P>because I had had two rows with the manager on the



<P>subject out there.&nbsp; I had refused to give up the smallest



<P>scrap out of that package, and I took the same attitude



<P>with the spectacled man.&nbsp; He became darkly menacing



<P>at last, and with much heat argued that the Company



<P>had the right to every bit of information about its 'ter-



<P>ritories.'&nbsp; And, said he, 'Mr. Kurtz's knowledge of



<P>unexplored regions must have been necessarily extensive



<P>and peculiar--owing to his great abilities and to the



<P>deplorable circumstances in which he had been placed:



<P>therefore'--I assured him Mr. Kurtz's knowledge,



<P>however extensive, did not bear upon the problems of



<P>commerce or administration.&nbsp; He invoked then the name



<P>of science.&nbsp; 'It would be an incalculable loss if,' &amp;c., &amp;c.



<P>I offered him the report on the 'Suppression of Savage



<P>Customs,' with the postscriptum torn off.&nbsp; He took it



<P>up eagerly, but ended by sniffing at it with an air of



<P>contempt.&nbsp; 'This is not what we had a right to expect,'



<P>he remarked.&nbsp; 'Expect nothing else,' I said.&nbsp; 'There



<P>are only private letters.'&nbsp; He withdrew upon some threat



<P>of legal proceedings, and I saw him no more; but an-



<P>other fellow, calling himself Kurtz's cousin, appeared



<P>two days later, and was anxious to hear all the details



<P>about his dear relative's last moments.&nbsp; Incidentally he



<P>gave me to understand that Kurtz had been essentially



<P>a great musician.&nbsp; 'There was the making of an im-



<P>mense success,' said the man, who was an organist, I



<P>believe, with lank gray hair flowing over a greasy coat-



<P>collar.&nbsp; I had no reason to doubt his statement; and to



<P>this day I am unable to say what was Kurtz's pro-



<P>fession, whether he ever had any--which was the greatest



<P>of his talents.&nbsp; I had taken him for a painter who wrote



<P>for the papers, or else for a journalist who could paint



<P>--but even the cousin (who took snuff during the inter-



<P>view) could not tell me what he had been--exactly.&nbsp; He



<P>was a universal genius--on that point I agreed with the



<P>old chap, who thereupon blew his nose noisily into a



<P>large cotton handkerchief and withdrew in senile agita-



<P>tion, bearing off some family letters and memoranda



<P>without importance.&nbsp; Ultimately a journalist anxious to



<P>know something of the fate of his 'dear colleague'



<P>turned up.&nbsp; This visitor informed me Kurtz's proper



<P>sphere ought to have been politics 'on the popular side.'



<P>He had furry straight eyebrows, bristly hair cropped



<P>short, an eye-glass on a broad ribbon, and, becoming



<P>expansive, confessed his opinion that Kurtz really



<P>couldn't write a bit--'but heavens! how that man could



<P>talk!&nbsp; He electrified large meetings.&nbsp; He had faith--



<P>don't you see?--he had the faith.&nbsp; He could get himself



<P>to believe anything--anything.&nbsp; He would have been



<P>a splendid leader of an extreme party.'&nbsp; 'What party?'



<P>I asked.&nbsp; 'Any party,' answered the other.&nbsp; 'He was



<P>an--an--extremist.'&nbsp; Did I not think so?&nbsp; I assented.



<P>Did I know, he asked, with a sudden flash of curiosity,



<P>'what it was that had induced him to go out there?'



<P>'Yes,' said I, and forthwith handed him the famous



<P>Report for publication, if he thought fit.&nbsp; He glanced



<P>through it hurriedly, mumbling all the time, judged 'it



<P>would do,' and took himself off with this plunder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thus I was left at last with a slim packet of letters



<P>and the girl's portrait.&nbsp; She struck me as beautiful--



<P>I mean she had a beautiful expression.&nbsp; I know that the



<P>sunlight can be made to lie too, yet one felt that no



<P>manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the



<P>delicate shade of truthfulness upon those features.&nbsp; She



<P>seemed ready to listen without mental reservation, with-



<P>out suspicion, without a thought for herself.&nbsp; I con-



<P>cluded I would go and give her back her portrait and



<P>those letters myself.&nbsp; Curiosity?&nbsp; Yes; and also some



<P>other feeling perhaps.&nbsp; All that had been Kurtz's had



<P>passed out of my hands: his soul, his body, his station,



<P>his plans, his ivory, his career.&nbsp; There remained only



<P>his memory and his Intended--and I wanted to give that



<P>up too to the past, in a way,--to surrender personally



<P>all that remained of him with me to that oblivion which



<P>is the last word of our common fate.&nbsp; I don't defend



<P>myself.&nbsp; I had no clear perception of what it was I



<P>really wanted.&nbsp; Perhaps it was an impulse of uncon-



<P>scious loyalty, or the fulfillment of one of these ironic



<P>necessities that lurk in the facts of human existence.



<P>I don't know.&nbsp; I can't tell.&nbsp; But I went.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought his memory was like the other memories



<P>of the dead that accumulate in every man's life,--a vague



<P>impress on the brain of shadows that had fallen on it



<P>in their swift and final passage; but before the high and



<P>ponderous door, between the tall houses of a street as



<P>still and decorous as a well-kept alley in a cemetery, I



<P>had a vision of him on the stretcher, opening his mouth



<P>voraciously, as if to devour all the earth with all its



<P>mankind.&nbsp; He lived then before me; he lived as much



<P>as he had ever lived--a shadow insatiable of splendid



<P>appearances, of frightful realities; a shadow darker than



<P>the shadow of the night, and draped nobly in the folds



<P>of a gorgeous eloquence.&nbsp; The vision seemed to enter



<P>the house with me--the stretcher, the phantom-bearers,



<P>the wild crowd of obedient worshipers, the gloom of the



<P>forests, the glitter of the reach between the murky bends,



<P>the beat of the drum, regular and muffled like the beat-



<P>ing of a heart--the heart of a conquering darkness.&nbsp; It



<P>was a moment of triumph for the wilderness, an invad-



<P>ing and vengeful rush which, it seemed to me, I would



<P>have to keep back alone for the salvation of another



<P>soul.&nbsp; And the memory of what I had heard him say



<P>afar there, with the horned shapes stirring at my back,



<P>in the glow of fires, within the patient woods, those



<P>broken phrases came back to me, were heard again in



<P>their ominous and terrifying simplicity.&nbsp; I remembered



<P>his abject pleading, his abject threats, the colossal scale



<P>of his vile desires, the meanness, the torment, the tem-



<P>pestuous anguish of his soul.&nbsp; And later on I seemed to



<P>see his collected languid manner, when he said one day,



<P>'This lot of ivory now is really mine.&nbsp; The Company



<P>did not pay for it.&nbsp; I collected it myself at a very great



<P>personal risk.&nbsp; I am afraid they will try to claim it as



<P>theirs though.&nbsp; H'm.&nbsp; It is a difficult case.&nbsp; What do



<P>you think I ought to do--resist?&nbsp; Eh?&nbsp; I want no more



<P>than justice.' . . .&nbsp; He wanted no more than justice--



<P>no more than justice.&nbsp; I rang the bell before a mahogany



<P>door on the first floor, and while I waited he seemed to



<P>stare at me out of the glassy panel--stare with that wide



<P>and immense stare embracing, condemning, loathing all



<P>the universe.&nbsp; I seemed to hear the whispered cry, 'The



<P>horror!&nbsp; The horror!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The dusk was falling.&nbsp; I had to wait in a lofty draw-



<P>ing-room with three long windows from floor to ceiling



<P>that were like three luminous and bedraped columns.



<P>The bent gilt legs and backs of the furniture shone in



<P>indistinct curves.&nbsp; The tall marble fireplace had a cold



<P>and monumental whiteness.&nbsp; A grand piano stood mas-



<P>sively in a corner, with dark gleams on the flat sur-



<P>faces like a somber and polished sarcophagus.&nbsp; A high



<P>door opened--closed.&nbsp; I rose.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She came forward, all in black, with a pale head,



<P>floating towards me in the dusk.&nbsp; She was in mourning.



<P>It was more than a year since his death, more than a



<P>year since the news came; she seemed as though she



<P>would remember and mourn for ever.&nbsp; She took both



<P>my hands in hers and murmured, 'I had heard you



<P>were coming.'&nbsp; I noticed she was not very young--I



<P>mean not girlish.&nbsp; She had a mature capacity for fidelity,



<P>for belief, for suffering.&nbsp; The room seemed to have



<P>grown darker, as if all the sad light of the cloudy



<P>evening had taken refuge on her forehead.&nbsp; This fair



<P>hair, this pale visage, this pure brow, seemed surrounded



<P>by an ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at



<P>me.&nbsp; Their glance was guileless, profound, confident, and



<P>trustful.&nbsp; She carried her sorrowful head as though she



<P>were proud of that sorrow, as though she would say, I



<P>--I alone know how to mourn for him as he deserves.



<P>But while we were still shaking hands, such a look of



<P>awful desolation came upon her face that I perceived she



<P>was one of those creatures that are not the playthings



<P>of Time.&nbsp; For her he had died only yesterday.&nbsp; And,



<P>by Jove! the impression was so powerful that for me too



<P>he seemed to have died only yesterday--nay, this very



<P>minute.&nbsp; I saw her and him in the same instant of time



<P>--his death and her sorrow--I saw her sorrow in the



<P>very moment of his death.&nbsp; Do you understand?&nbsp; I saw



<P>them together--I heard them together.&nbsp; She had said,



<P>with a deep catch of the breath, 'I have survived;' while



<P>my strained ears seemed to hear distinctly, mingled with



<P>her tone of despairing regret, the summing-up whisper



<P>of his eternal condemnation.&nbsp; I asked myself what I



<P>was doing there, with a sensation of panic in my heart



<P>as though I had blundered into a place of cruel and



<P>absurd mysteries not fit for a human being to behold.



<P>She motioned me to a chair.&nbsp; We sat down.&nbsp; I laid the



<P>packet gently on the little table, and she put her hand



<P>over it. . . .&nbsp; 'You knew him well,' she murmured,



<P>after a moment of mourning silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'Intimacy grows quick out there,' I said.&nbsp; 'I knew



<P>him as well as it is possible for one man to know another.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'And you admired him,' she said.&nbsp; 'It was impossible



<P>to know him and not to admire him.&nbsp; Was it?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'He was a remarkable man,' I said, unsteadily.&nbsp; Then



<P>before the appealing fixity of her gaze, that seemed to



<P>watch for more words on my lips, I went on, 'It was



<P>impossible not to--'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'Love him,' she finished eagerly, silencing me into



<P>an appalled dumbness.&nbsp; 'How true! how true!&nbsp; But



<P>when you think that no one knew him so well as I!&nbsp; I



<P>had all his noble confidence.&nbsp; I knew him best.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'You knew him best,' I repeated.&nbsp; And perhaps she



<P>did.&nbsp; But with every word spoken the room was growing



<P>darker, and only her forehead, smooth and white, re-



<P>mained illumined by the unextinguishable light of belief



<P>and love.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'You were his friend,' she went on.&nbsp; 'His friend,'



<P>she repeated, a little louder.&nbsp; 'You must have been, if



<P>he had given you this, and sent you to me.&nbsp; I feel I



<P>can speak to you--and oh! I must speak.&nbsp; I want you



<P>--you who have heard his last words--to know I have



<P>been worthy of him. . . .&nbsp; It is not pride. . . .&nbsp; Yes!



<P>I am proud to know I understood him better than any-



<P>one on earth--he told me so himself.&nbsp; And since his



<P>mother died I have had no one--no one--to--to--'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I listened.&nbsp; The darkness deepened.&nbsp; I was not even



<P>sure whether he had given me the right bundle.&nbsp; I rather



<P>suspect he wanted me to take care of another batch of



<P>his papers which, after his death, I saw the manager



<P>examining under the lamp.&nbsp; And the girl talked, easing



<P>her pain in the certitude of my sympathy; she talked as



<P>thirsty men drink.&nbsp; I had heard that her engagement



<P>with Kurtz had been disapproved by her people.&nbsp; He



<P>wasn't rich enough or something.&nbsp; And indeed I don't



<P>know whether he had not been a pauper all his life.&nbsp; He



<P>had given me some reason to infer that it was his im-



<P>patience of comparative poverty that drove him out



<P>there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'. . .&nbsp; Who was not his friend who had heard him



<P>speak once?' she was saying.&nbsp; 'He drew men towards



<P>him by what was best in them.'&nbsp; She looked at me with



<P>intensity.&nbsp; 'It is the gift of the great,' she went on,



<P>and the sound of her low voice seemed to have the ac-



<P>companiment of all the other sounds, full of mystery,



<P>desolation, and sorrow, I had ever heard--the ripple of



<P>the river, the soughing of the trees swayed by the wind,



<P>the murmurs of wild crowds, the faint ring of incom-



<P>prehensible words cried from afar, the whisper of a



<P>voice speaking from beyond the threshold of an eternal



<P>darkness.&nbsp; 'But you have heard him!&nbsp; You know!' she



<P>cried.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'Yes, I know,' I said with something like despair



<P>in my heart, but bowing my head before the faith that



<P>was in her, before that great and saving illusion that



<P>shone with an unearthly glow in the darkness, in the



<P>triumphant darkness from which I could not have de-



<P>fended her--from which I could not even defend



<P>myself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'What a loss to me--to us!'--she corrected herself



<P>with beautiful generosity; then added in a murmur, 'To



<P>the world.'&nbsp; By the last gleams of twilight I could see



<P>the glitter of her eyes, full of tears--of tears that would



<P>not fall.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'I have been very happy--very fortunate--very



<P>proud,' she went on.&nbsp; 'Too fortunate.&nbsp; Too happy for



<P>a little while.&nbsp; And now I am unhappy for--for



<P>life.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She stood up; her fair hair seemed to catch all the



<P>remaining light in a glimmer of gold.&nbsp; I rose too.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'And of all this,' she went on, mournfully, 'of all his



<P>promise, and of all his greatness, of his generous mind,



<P>of his noble heart, nothing remains--nothing but a



<P>memory.&nbsp; You and I--'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'We shall always remember him,' I said, hastily.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'No!' she cried.&nbsp; 'It is impossible that all this should



<P>be lost--that such a life should be sacrificed to leave



<P>nothing--but sorrow.&nbsp; You know what vast plans he



<P>had.&nbsp; I knew of them too--I could not perhaps under-



<P>stand,--but others knew of them.&nbsp; Something must re-



<P>main.&nbsp; His words, at least, have not died.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'His words will remain,' I said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'And his example,' she whispered to herself.&nbsp; 'Men



<P>looked up to him,--his goodness shone in every act.&nbsp; His



<P>example--'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'True,' I said; 'his example too.&nbsp; Yes, his example.



<P>I forgot that.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'But I do not.&nbsp; I cannot--I cannot believe--not yet.



<P>I cannot believe that I shall never see him again, that



<P>nobody will see him again, never, never, never.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She put out her arms as if after a retreating figure,



<P>stretching them black and with clasped pale hands across



<P>the fading and narrow sheen of the window.&nbsp; Never see



<P>him!&nbsp; I saw him clearly enough then.&nbsp; I shall see this



<P>eloquent phantom as long as I live, and I shall see her



<P>too, a tragic and familiar Shade, resembling in this ges-



<P>ture another one, tragic also, and bedecked with power-



<P>less charms, stretching bare brown arms over the glitter



<P>of the infernal stream, the stream of darkness.&nbsp; She said



<P>suddenly very low, 'He died as he lived.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'His end,' said I, with dull anger stirring in me,



<P>'was in every way worthy of his life.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'And I was not with him,' she murmured.&nbsp; My anger



<P>subsided before a feeling of infinite pity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'Everything that could be done--' I mumbled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'Ah, but I believed in him more than anyone on



<P>earth--more than his own mother, more than--himself.



<P>He needed me!&nbsp; Me!&nbsp; I would have treasured every sigh,



<P>every word, every sign, every glance.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I felt like a chill grip on my chest.&nbsp; 'Don't,' I said,



<P>in a muffled voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'Forgive me.&nbsp; I--I--have mourned so long in silence



<P>--in silence. . . .&nbsp; You were with him--to the last?



<P>I think of his loneliness.&nbsp; Nobody near to understand



<P>him as I would have understood.&nbsp; Perhaps no one to



<P>hear. . . .'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'To the very end,' I said, shakily.&nbsp; 'I heard his very



<P>last words. . . .'&nbsp; I stopped in a fright.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'Repeat them,' she said in a heart-broken tone.&nbsp; 'I



<P>want--I want--something--something--to--to live



<P>with.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was on the point of crying at her, 'Don't you hear



<P>them?'&nbsp; The dusk was repeating them in a persistent



<P>whisper all around us, in a whisper that seemed to swell



<P>menacingly like the first whisper of a rising wind.&nbsp; 'The



<P>horror! the horror!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'His last word--to live with,' she murmured.&nbsp; 'Don't



<P>you understand I loved him--I loved him--I loved him!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I pulled myself together and spoke slowly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"'The last word he pronounced was--your name.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I heard a light sigh, and then my heart stood still,



<P>stopped dead short by an exulting and terrible cry, by



<P>the cry of inconceivable triumph and of unspeakable



<P>pain.&nbsp; 'I knew it--I was sure!' . . .&nbsp; She knew.&nbsp; She



<P>was sure.&nbsp; I heard her weeping; she had hidden her



<P>face in her hands.&nbsp; It seemed to me that the house would



<P>collapse before I could escape, that the heavens would



<P>fall upon my head.&nbsp; But nothing happened.&nbsp; The



<P>heavens do not fall for such a trifle.&nbsp; Would they have



<P>fallen, I wonder, if I had rendered Kurtz that justice



<P>which was his due?&nbsp; Hadn't he said he wanted only jus-



<P>tice?&nbsp; But I couldn't.&nbsp; I could not tell her.&nbsp; It would



<P>have been too dark--too dark altogether. . . ."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Marlow ceased, and sat apart, indistinct and silent, in



<P>the pose of a meditating Buddha.&nbsp; Nobody moved for a



<P>time.&nbsp; "We have lost the first of the ebb," said the Di-



<P>rector, suddenly.&nbsp; I raised my head.&nbsp; The offing was



<P>barred by a black bank of clouds, and the tranquil water-



<P>way leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed



<P>somber under an overcast sky--seemed to lead into the



<P>heart of an immense darkness.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>"One evening as I was lying flat on the deck of my



<P>steamboat, I heard voices approaching--and there were



<P>the nephew and the uncle strolling along the bank.&nbsp; I



<P>laid my head on my arm again, and had nearly lost



<P>myself in a doze, when somebody said in my ear, as it



<P>were: 'I am as harmless as a little child, but I don't like



<P>to be dictated to.&nbsp; Am I the manager--or am I not?&nbsp; I



<P>was ordered to send him there.&nbsp; It's incredible.' . . .



<P>I became aware that the two were standing on the shore



<P>alongside the forepart of the steamboat, just below my



<P>head.&nbsp; I did not move; it did not occur to me to move: I



<P>was sleepy.&nbsp; 'It IS unpleasant,' grunted the uncle.&nbsp; 'He



<P>has asked the Administration to be sent there,' said the



<P>other, 'with the idea of showing what he could do; and



<P>I was instructed accordingly.&nbsp; Look at the influence that



<P>man must have.&nbsp; Is it not frightful?'&nbsp; They both agreed



<P>it was frightful, then made several bizarre remarks:



<P>'Make rain and fine weather--one man--the Council--



<P>by the nose'--bits of absurd sentences that got the



<P>better of my drowsiness, so that I had pretty near the



<P>whole of my wits about me when the uncle said, 'The



<P>climate may do away with this difficulty for you.&nbsp; Is he



<P>alone there?'&nbsp; 'Yes,' answered the manager; 'he sent



<P>his assistant down the river with a note to me in these



<P>terms: "Clear this poor devil out of the country, and



<P>don't bother sending more of that sort.&nbsp; I had rather



<P>be alone than have the kind of men you can dispose of



<P>with me."&nbsp; It was more than a year ago.&nbsp; Can you



<P>imagine such impudence!'&nbsp; 'Anything since then?'



<P>asked the other, hoarsely.&nbsp; 'Ivory,' jerked the nephew;



<P>'lots of it--prime sort--lots--most annoying, from



<P>him.'&nbsp; 'And with that?' questioned the heavy rumble.



<P>'Invoice,' was the reply fired out, so to speak.&nbsp; Then



<P>silence.&nbsp; They had been talking about Kurtz.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was broad awake by this time, but, lying perfectly



<P>at ease, remained still, having no inducement to change



<P>my position.&nbsp; 'How did that ivory come all this way?'



<P>growled the elder man, who seemed very vexed.&nbsp; The



<P>other explained that it had come with a fleet of canoes in



<P>charge of an English half-caste clerk Kurtz had with



<P>him; that Kurtz had apparently intended to return him-



<P>self, the station being by that time bare of goods and



<P>stores, but after coming three hundred miles, had sud-



<P>denly decided to go back, which he started to do alone



<P>in a small dug-out with four paddlers, leaving the half-



<P>caste to continue down the river with the ivory.&nbsp; The two



<P>fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting



<P>such a thing.&nbsp; They were at a loss for an adequate mo-



<P>tive.&nbsp; As to me, I seemed to see Kurtz for the first time.



<P>It was a distinct glimpse: the dug-out, four paddling



<P>savages, and the lone white man turning his back sud-



<P>denly on the headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of



<P>home--perhaps; setting his face towards the depths of



<P>the wilderness, towards his empty and desolate station.



<P>I did not know the motive.&nbsp; Perhaps he was just simply



<P>a fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake.&nbsp; His



<P>name, you understand, had not been pronounced once.



<P>He was 'that man.'&nbsp; The half-caste, who, as far as I



<P>could see, had conducted a difficult trip with great pru-



<P>dence and pluck, was invariably alluded to as 'that



<P>scoundrel.'&nbsp; The 'scoundrel' had reported that the



<P>'man' had been very ill--had recovered imperfectly.



<P>. . .&nbsp; The two below me moved away then a few paces,



<P>and strolled back and forth at some little distance.&nbsp; I



<P>heard: 'Military post--doctor--two hundred miles--



<P>quite alone now--unavoidable delays--nine months--no



<P>news--strange rumors.'&nbsp; They approached again, just



<P>as the manager was saying, 'No one, as far as I know,



<P>unless a species of wandering trader--a pestilential fel-



<P>low, snapping ivory from the natives.'&nbsp; Who was it they



<P>were talking about now?&nbsp; I gathered in snatches that



<P>this was some man supposed to be in Kurtz's district, and



<P>of whom the manager did not approve.&nbsp; 'We will not be



<P>free from unfair competition till one of these fellows is



<P>hanged for an example,' he said.&nbsp; 'Certainly,' grunted



<P>the other; 'get him hanged!&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Anything--



<P>anything can be done in this country.&nbsp; That's what I



<P>say; nobody here, you understand, HERE, can endanger



<P>your position.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; You stand the climate--you



<P>outlast them all.&nbsp; The danger is in Europe; but there



<P>before I left I took care to--'&nbsp; They moved off and



<P>whispered, then their voices rose again.&nbsp; 'The extraor-



<P>dinary series of delays is not my fault.&nbsp; I did my



<P>possible.'&nbsp; The fat man sighed, 'Very sad.'&nbsp; 'And the



<P>pestiferous absurdity of his talk,' continued the other;



<P>'he bothered me enough when he was here.&nbsp; "Each



<P>station should be like a beacon on the road towards better



<P>things, a center for trade of course, but also for human-



<P>izing, improving, instructing."&nbsp; Conceive you--that ass!



<P>And he wants to be manager!&nbsp; No, it's--'&nbsp; Here he



<P>got choked by excessive indignation, and I lifted my



<P>head the least bit.&nbsp; I was surprised to see how near they



<P>were--right under me.&nbsp; I could have spat upon their



<P>hats.&nbsp; They were looking on the ground, absorbed in



<P>thought.&nbsp; The manager was switching his leg with a



<P>slender twig: his sagacious relative lifted his head.&nbsp; 'You



<P>have been well since you came out this time?' he asked.



<P>The other gave a start.&nbsp; 'Who?&nbsp; I?&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Like a

charm



<P>--like a charm.&nbsp; But the rest--oh, my goodness!&nbsp; All



<P>sick.&nbsp; They die so quick, too, that I haven't the time



<P>to send them out of the country--it's incredible!'&nbsp; 'H'm.



<P>Just so,' grunted the uncle.&nbsp; 'Ah! my boy, trust to this



<P>--I say, trust to this.'&nbsp; I saw him extend his short flipper



<P>of an arm for a gesture that took in the forest, the



<P>creek, the mud, the river,--seemed to beckon with a dis-



<P>honoring flourish before the sunlit face of the land a



<P>treacherous appeal to the lurking death, to the hidden



<P>evil, to the profound darkness of its heart.&nbsp; It was so



<P>startling that I leaped to my feet and looked back at



<P>the edge of the forest, as though I had expected an



<P>answer of some sort to that black display of confidence.



<P>You know the foolish notions that come to one some-



<P>times.&nbsp; The high stillness confronted these two figures



<P>with its ominous patience, waiting for the passing away



<P>of a fantastic invasion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They swore aloud together--out of sheer fright, I



<P>believe--then pretending not to know anything of my



<P>existence, turned back to the station.&nbsp; The sun was low;



<P>and leaning forward side by side, they seemed to be



<P>tugging painfully uphill their two ridiculous shadows



<P>of unequal length, that trailed behind them slowly over



<P>the tall grass without bending a single blade.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"In a few days the Eldorado Expedition went into the



<P>patient wilderness, that closed upon it as the sea closes



<P>over a diver.&nbsp; Long afterwards the news came that all



<P>the donkeys were dead.&nbsp; I know nothing as to the fate of



<P>the less valuable animals.&nbsp; They, no doubt, like the rest



<P>of us, found what they deserved.&nbsp; I did not inquire.&nbsp; I



<P>was then rather excited at the prospect of meeting Kurtz



<P>very soon.&nbsp; When I say very soon I mean it compara-



<P>tively.&nbsp; It was just two months from the day we left



<P>the creek when we came to the bank below Kurtz's sta-



<P>tion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Going up that river was like traveling back to the



<P>earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted



<P>on the earth and the big trees were kings.&nbsp; An empty



<P>stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest.&nbsp; The air



<P>was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish.&nbsp; There was no joy



<P>in the brilliance of sunshine.&nbsp; The long stretches of the



<P>waterway ran on, deserted, into the gloom of over-



<P>shadowed distances.&nbsp; On silvery sandbanks hippos and



<P>alligators sunned themselves side by side.&nbsp; The broaden-



<P>ing waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands; you



<P>lost your way on that river as you would in a desert, and



<P>butted all day long against shoals, trying to find the



<P>channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut



<P>off for ever from everything you had known once--some



<P>where--far away--in another existence perhaps.&nbsp; There



<P>were moments when one's past came back to one, as it



<P>will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare



<P>to yourself; but it came in the shape of an unrestful



<P>and noisy dream, remembered with wonder amongst the



<P>overwhelming realities of this strange world of plants,



<P>and water, and silence.&nbsp; And this stillness of life did



<P>not in the least resemble a peace.&nbsp; It was the stillness of



<P>an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable inten-



<P>tion.&nbsp; It looked at you with a vengeful aspect.&nbsp; I got



<P>used to it afterwards; I did not see it any more; I had



<P>no time.&nbsp; I had to keep guessing at the channel; I had



<P>to discern, mostly by inspiration, the signs of hidden



<P>banks; I watched for sunken stones; I was learning to



<P>clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out, when



<P>I shaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would



<P>have ripped the life out of the tin-pot steamboat and



<P>drowned all the pilgrims; I had to keep a look-out for



<P>the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night for



<P>next day's steaming.&nbsp; When you have to attend to



<P>things of that sort, to the mere incidents of the sur-



<P>face, the reality--the reality, I tell you--fades.&nbsp; The



<P>inner truth is hidden--luckily, luckily.&nbsp; But I felt it



<P>all the same; I felt often its mysterious stillness watching



<P>me at my monkey tricks, just as it watches you fellows



<P>performing on your respective tight-ropes for--what is



<P>it? half-a-crown a tumble--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Try to be civil, Marlow," growled a voice, and I



<P>knew there was at least one listener awake besides my-



<P>self.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I forgot the heartache which



<P>makes up the rest of the price.&nbsp; And indeed what does



<P>the price matter, if the trick be well done?&nbsp; You do



<P>your tricks very well.&nbsp; And I didn't do badly either,



<P>since I managed not to sink that steamboat on my first



<P>trip.&nbsp; It's a wonder to me yet.&nbsp; Imagine a blindfolded



<P>man set to drive a van over a bad road.&nbsp; I sweated and



<P>shivered over that business considerably, I can tell you.



<P>After all, for a seaman, to scrape the bottom of the thing



<P>that's supposed to float all the time under his care is



<P>the unpardonable sin.&nbsp; No one may know of it, but you



<P>never forget the thump--eh?&nbsp; A blow on the very heart.



<P>You remember it, you dream of it, you wake up at night



<P>and think of it--years after--and go hot and cold all



<P>over.&nbsp; I don't pretend to say that steamboat floated all



<P>the time.&nbsp; More than once she had to wade for a bit,



<P>with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing.



<P>We had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a



<P>crew.&nbsp; Fine fellows--cannibals--in their place.&nbsp; They



<P>were men one could work with, and I am grateful to



<P>them.&nbsp; And, after all, they did not each other before



<P>my face: they had brought along a provision of hippo-



<P>meat which went rotten, and made the mystery of the



<P>wilderness stink in my nostrils.&nbsp; Phoo!&nbsp; I can sniff it



<P>now.&nbsp; I had the manager on board and three or four



<P>pilgrims with their staves--all complete.&nbsp; Sometimes we



<P>came upon a station close by the bank, clinging to the



<P>skirts of the unknown, and the white men rushing out



<P>of a tumble-down hovel, with great gestures of joy and



<P>surprise and welcome, seemed very strange,--had the ap-



<P>pearance of being held there captive by a spell.&nbsp; The word



<P>ivory would ring in the air for a while--and on we went



<P>again into the silence, along empty reaches, round the



<P>still bends, between the high walls of our winding way,



<P>reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the



<P>stern-wheel.&nbsp; Trees, trees, millions of trees, massive,



<P>immense, running up high; and at their foot, hugging



<P>the bank against the stream, crept the little begrimed



<P>steamboat, like a sluggish beetle crawling on the floor



<P>of a lofty portico.&nbsp; It made you feel very small, very



<P>lost, and yet it was not altogether depressing that feel-



<P>ing.&nbsp; After all, if you were small, the grimy beetle



<P>crawled on--which was just what you wanted it to do.



<P>Where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to I don't know.



<P>To some place where they expected to get something, I



<P>bet!&nbsp; For me it crawled toward Kurtz--exclusively; but



<P>when the steam-pipes started leaking we crawled very



<P>slow.&nbsp; The reaches opened before us and closed behind,



<P>as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water



<P>to bar the way for our return.&nbsp; We penetrated deeper



<P>and deeper into the heart of darkness.&nbsp; It was very quiet



<P>there.&nbsp; At night sometimes the roll of drums behind the



<P>curtain of trees would run up the river and remain



<P>sustained faintly, as if hovering in the air high over our



<P>heads, till the first break of day.&nbsp; Whether it meant war,



<P>peace, or prayer we could not tell.&nbsp; The dawns were



<P>heralded by the descent of a chill stillness; the wood-



<P>cutters slept, their fires burned low; the snapping of



<P>a twig would make you start.&nbsp; We were wanderers on



<P>a prehistoric earth, on an earth that wore the aspect



<P>of an unknown planet.&nbsp; We could have fancied ourselves



<P>the first of men taking possession of an accursed in-



<P>heritance, to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish



<P>and of excessive toil.&nbsp; But suddenly, as we struggled



<P>round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls,



<P>of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black



<P>limbs, a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of



<P>bodies swaying, of eyes rolling, under the droop of heavy



<P>and motionless foliage.&nbsp; The steamer toiled along slowly



<P>on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy.&nbsp; The



<P>prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, wel-



<P>coming us--who could tell?&nbsp; We were cut off from the



<P>comprehension of our surroundings; we glided past like



<P>phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men



<P>would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse.



<P>We could not understand, because we were too far and



<P>could not remember, because we were traveling in the



<P>night of first ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving



<P>hardly a sign--and no memories.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The earth seemed unearthly.&nbsp; We are accustomed to



<P>look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but



<P>there--there you could look at a thing monstrous and



<P>free.&nbsp; It was unearthly, and the men were--&nbsp; No, they



<P>were not inhuman.&nbsp; Well, you know, that was the worst



<P>of it--this suspicion of their not being inhuman.&nbsp; It



<P>would come slowly to one.&nbsp; They howled, and leaped, and



<P>spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was



<P>just the thought of their humanity--like yours--the



<P>thought of your remote kinship with this wild and pas-



<P>sionate uproar.&nbsp; Ugly.&nbsp; Yes, it was ugly enough; but



<P>if you were man enough you would admit to yourself



<P>that there was in you just the faintest trace of a re-



<P>sponse to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim



<P>suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you--



<P>you so remote from the night of first ages--could com-



<P>prehend.&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp; The mind of man is capable



<P>of anything--because everything is in it, all the past



<P>as well as all the future.&nbsp; What was there after all?



<P>Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valor, rage--who can tell?



<P>--but truth--truth stripped of its cloak of time.&nbsp; Let



<P>the fool gape and shudder--the man knows, and can



<P>look on without a wink.&nbsp; But he must at least be as



<P>much of a man as these on the shore.&nbsp; He must meet



<P>that truth with his own true stuff--with his own inborn



<P>strength.&nbsp; Principles?&nbsp; Principles won't do.&nbsp; Acquisi-



<P>tions, clothes, pretty rags--rags that would fly off at



<P>the first good shake.&nbsp; No; you want a deliberate belief.



<P>An appeal to me in this fiendish row--is there?&nbsp; Very



<P>well; I hear; I admit, but I have a voice too, and for



<P>good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced.



<P>Of course, a fool, what with sheer fright and fine senti-



<P>ments, is always safe.&nbsp; Who's that grunting?&nbsp; You



<P>wonder I didn't go ashore for a howl and a dance?&nbsp; Well,



<P>no--I didn't.&nbsp; Fine sentiments, you say?&nbsp; Fine senti-



<P>ments, be hanged!&nbsp; I had no time.&nbsp; I had to mess about



<P>with white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping



<P>to put bandages on those leaky steam-pipes--I tell you.



<P>I had to watch the steering, and circumvent those snags,



<P>and get the tin-pot along by hook or by crook.&nbsp; There



<P>was surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser



<P>man.&nbsp; And between whiles I had to look after the savage



<P>who was fireman.&nbsp; He was an improved specimen; he



<P>could fire up a vertical boiler.&nbsp; He was there below me,



<P>and, upon my word, to look at him was as edifying as



<P>seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat,



<P>walking on his hind-legs.&nbsp; A few months of training had



<P>done for that really fine chap.&nbsp; He squinted at the



<P>steam-gauge and at the water-gauge with an evident



<P>effort of intrepidity--and he had filed teeth too, the



<P>poor devil, and the wool of his pate shaved into queer



<P>patterns, and three ornamental scars on each of his



<P>cheeks.&nbsp; He ought to have been clapping his hands and



<P>stamping his feet on the bank, instead of which he was



<P>hard at work, a thrall to strange witchcraft, full of



<P>improving knowledge.&nbsp; He was useful because he had



<P>been instructed; and what he knew was this--that should



<P>the water in that transparent thing disappear, the evil



<P>spirit inside the boiler would get angry through the



<P>greatness of his thirst, and take a terrible vengeance.



<P>So he sweated and fired up and watched the glass fear-



<P>fully (with an impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to



<P>his arm, and a piece of polished bone, as big as a watch,



<P>stuck flatways through his lower lip), while the wooded



<P>banks slipped past us slowly, the short noise was left



<P>behind, the interminable miles of silence--and we crept



<P>on, towards Kurtz.&nbsp; But the snags were thick, the water



<P>was treacherous and shallow, the boiler seemed indeed



<P>to have a sulky devil in it, and thus neither that fire-



<P>man nor I had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Some fifty miles below the Inner Station we came



<P>upon a hut of reeds, an inclined and melancholy pole,



<P>with the unrecognizable tatters of what had been a flag



<P>of some sort flying from it, and a neatly stacked wood-



<P>pile.&nbsp; This was unexpected.&nbsp; We came to the bank, and



<P>on the stack of firewood found a flat piece of board with



<P>some faded pencil-writing on it.&nbsp; When deciphered it



<P>said: 'Wood for you.&nbsp; Hurry up.&nbsp; Approach cautiously.'



<P>There was a signature, but it was illegible--not Kurtz



<P>--a much longer word.&nbsp; Hurry up.&nbsp; Where?&nbsp; Up the



<P>river?&nbsp; 'Approach cautiously.'&nbsp; We had not done so.



<P>But the warning could not have been meant for the place



<P>where it could be only found after approach.&nbsp; Some-



<P>thing was wrong above.&nbsp; But what--and how much?



<P>That was the question.&nbsp; We commented adversely upon



<P>the imbecility of that telegraphic style.&nbsp; The bush around



<P>said nothing, and would not let us look very far, either.



<P>A torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the



<P>hut, and flapped sadly in our faces.&nbsp; The dwelling was



<P>dismantled; but we could see a white man had lived



<P>there not very long ago.&nbsp; There remained a rude table



<P>--a plank on two posts; a heap of rubbish reposed in a



<P>dark corner, and by the door I picked up a book.&nbsp; It



<P>had lost its covers, and the pages had been thumbed into



<P>a state of extremely dirty softness; but the back had been



<P>lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which



<P>looked clean yet.&nbsp; It was an extraordinary find.&nbsp; Its title



<P>was, 'An Inquiry into some Points of Seamanship,' by a



<P>man Tower, Towson--some such name--Master in his



<P>Majesty's Navy.&nbsp; The matter looked dreary reading



<P>enough, with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of



<P>figures, and the copy was sixty years old.&nbsp; I handled this



<P>amazing antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness,



<P>lest it should dissolve in my hands.&nbsp; Within, Towson or



<P>Towser was inquiring earnestly into the breaking strain



<P>of ships' chains and tackle, and other such matters.&nbsp; Not



<P>a very enthralling book; but at the first glance you



<P>could see there a singleness of intention, an honest con-



<P>cern for the right way of going to work, which made



<P>these humble pages, thought out so many years ago,



<P>luminous with another than a professional light.&nbsp; The



<P>simple old sailor, with his talk of chains and purchases,



<P>made me forget the jungle and the pilgrims in a delicious



<P>sensation of having come upon something unmistakably



<P>real.&nbsp; Such a book being there was wonderful enough;



<P>but still more astounding were the notes penciled in the



<P>margin, and plainly referring to the text.&nbsp; I couldn't



<P>believe my eyes!&nbsp; They were in cipher!&nbsp; Yes, it looked



<P>like cipher.&nbsp; Fancy a man lugging with him a book of



<P>that description into this nowhere and studying it--



<P>and making notes--in cipher at that!&nbsp; It was an ex-



<P>travagant mystery.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying



<P>noise, and when I lifted my eyes I saw the wood-pile



<P>was gone, and the manager, aided by all the pilgrims,



<P>was shouting at me from the river-side.&nbsp; I slipped the



<P>book into my pocket.&nbsp; I assure you to leave off reading



<P>was like tearing myself away from the shelter of an old



<P>and solid friendship.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I started the lame engine ahead.&nbsp; 'It must be this



<P>miserable trader--this intruder,' exclaimed the manager,



<P>looking back malevolently at the place we had left.&nbsp; 'He



<P>must be English,' I said.&nbsp; 'It will not save him from



<P>getting into trouble if he is not careful,' muttered the



<P>manager darkly.&nbsp; I observed with assumed innocence that



<P>no man was safe from trouble in this world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The current was more rapid now, the steamer seemed



<P>at her last gasp, the stern-wheel flopped languidly, and



<P>I caught myself listening on tiptoe for the next beat of



<P>the float, for in sober truth I expected the wretched thing



<P>to give up every moment.&nbsp; It was like watching the last



<P>flickers of a life.&nbsp; But still we crawled.&nbsp; Sometimes I



<P>would pick out a tree a little way ahead to measure our



<P>progress towards Kurtz by, but I lost it invariably be-



<P>fore we got abreast.&nbsp; To keep the eyes so long on one



<P>thing was too much for human patience.&nbsp; The manager



<P>displayed a beautiful resignation.&nbsp; I fretted and fumed



<P>and took to arguing with myself whether or no I would



<P>talk openly with Kurtz; but before I could come to any



<P>conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence,



<P>indeed any action of mine, would be a mere futility.



<P>What did it matter what anyone knew or ignored?&nbsp; What



<P>did it matter who was manager?&nbsp; One gets sometimes



<P>such a flash of insight.&nbsp; The essentials of this affair lay



<P>deep under the surface, beyond my reach, and beyond



<P>my power of meddling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Towards the evening of the second day we judged



<P>ourselves about eight miles from Kurtz's station.&nbsp; I



<P>wanted to push on; but the manager looked grave, and



<P>told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it



<P>would be advisable, the sun being very low already, to



<P>wait where we were till next morning.&nbsp; Moreover, he



<P>pointed out that if the warning to approach cautiously



<P>were to be followed, we must approach in daylight--



<P>not at dusk, or in the dark.&nbsp; This was sensible enough.



<P>Eight miles meant nearly three hours' steaming for us,



<P>and I could also see suspicious ripples at the upper end



<P>of the reach.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I was annoyed beyond ex-



<P>pression at the delay, and most unreasonably too, since



<P>one night more could not matter much after so many



<P>months.&nbsp; As we had plenty of wood, and caution was



<P>the word, I brought up in the middle of the stream.



<P>The reach was narrow, straight, with high sides like a



<P>railway cutting.&nbsp; The dusk came gliding into it long



<P>before the sun had set.&nbsp; The current ran smooth and



<P>swift, but a dumb immobility sat on the banks.&nbsp; The



<P>living trees, lashed together by the creepers and every



<P>living bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed



<P>into stone, even to the slenderest twig, to the lightest



<P>leaf.&nbsp; It was not sleep--it seemed unnatural, like a



<P>state of trance.&nbsp; Not the faintest sound of any kind



<P>could be heard.&nbsp; You looked on amazed, and began to



<P>suspect yourself of being deaf--then the night came



<P>suddenly, and struck you blind as well.&nbsp; About three



<P>in the morning some large fish leaped, and the loud



<P>splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired.



<P>When the sun rose there was a white fog, very warm



<P>and clammy, and more blinding than the night.&nbsp; It did



<P>not shift or drive; it was just there, standing all round



<P>you like something solid.&nbsp; At eight or nine, perhaps, it



<P>lifted as a shutter lifts.&nbsp; We had a glimpse of the tower-



<P>ing multitude of trees, of the immense matted jungle,



<P>with the blazing little ball of the sun hanging over it--



<P>all perfectly still--and then the white shutter came down



<P>again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves.&nbsp; I



<P>ordered the chain, which we had begun to heave in, to



<P>be paid out again.&nbsp; Before it stopped running with a



<P>muffled rattle, a cry, a very loud cry, as of infinite



<P>desolation, soared slowly in the opaque air.&nbsp; It ceased.



<P>A complaining clamor, modulated in savage discords,



<P>filled our ears.&nbsp; The sheer unexpectedness of it made



<P>my hair stir under my cap.&nbsp; I don't know how it struck



<P>the others: to me it seemed as though the mist itself



<P>had screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from all



<P>sides at once, did this tumultuous and mournful uproar



<P>arise.&nbsp; It culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost



<P>intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short, leav-



<P>ing us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes, and ob-



<P>stinately listening to the nearly as appalling and ex-



<P>cessive silence.&nbsp; 'Good God!&nbsp; What is the meaning--?'



<P>stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims,--a little



<P>fat man, with sandy hair and red whiskers, who wore



<P>side-spring boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his



<P>socks.&nbsp; Two others remained open-mouthed a whole min-



<P>ute, then dashed into the little cabin, to rush out in-



<P>continently and stand darting scared glances, with Win-



<P>chesters at 'ready' in their hands.&nbsp; What we could see



<P>was just the steamer we were on, her outlines blurred as



<P>though she had been on the point of dissolving, and a



<P>misty strip of water, perhaps two feet broad, around



<P>her--and that was all.&nbsp; The rest of the world was no-



<P>where, as far as our eyes and ears were concerned.&nbsp; Just



<P>nowhere.&nbsp; Gone, disappeared; swept off without leaving



<P>a whisper or a shadow behind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I went forward, and ordered the chain to be hauled



<P>in short, so as to be ready to trip the anchor and move



<P>the steamboat at once if necessary.&nbsp; 'Will they attack?'



<P>whispered an awed voice.&nbsp; 'We will all be butchered in



<P>this fog,' murmured another.&nbsp; The faces twitched with



<P>the strain, the hands trembled slightly, the eyes forgot



<P>to wink.&nbsp; It was very curious to see the contrast of ex-



<P>pressions of the white men and of the black fellows of



<P>our crew, who were as much strangers to that part of the



<P>river as we, though their homes were only eight hundred



<P>miles away.&nbsp; The whites, of course greatly discomposed,



<P>had besides a curious look of being painfully shocked



<P>by such an outrageous row.&nbsp; The others had an alert,



<P>naturally interested expression; but their faces were es-



<P>sentially quiet, even those of the one or two who grinned



<P>as they hauled at the chain.&nbsp; Several exchanged short,



<P>grunting phrases, which seemed to settle the matter to



<P>their satisfaction.&nbsp; Their headman, a young, broad-



<P>chested black, severely draped in dark-blue fringed



<P>cloths, with fierce nostrils and his hair all done up art-



<P>fully in oily ringlets, stood near me.&nbsp; 'Aha!' I said, just



<P>for good fellowship's sake.&nbsp; 'Catch 'im,' he snapped,



<P>with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of



<P>sharp teeth--'catch 'im.&nbsp; Give 'im to us.'&nbsp; 'To you,



<P>eh?' I asked; 'what would you do with them?'&nbsp; 'Eat



<P>'im!' he said curtly, and, leaning his elbow on the rail,



<P>looked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly



<P>pensive attitude.&nbsp; I would no doubt have been properly



<P>horrified, had it not occurred to me that he and his



<P>chaps must be very hungry: that they must have been



<P>growing increasingly hungry for at least this month



<P>past.&nbsp; They had been engaged for six months (I don't



<P>think a single one of them had any clear idea of time,



<P>as we at the end of countless ages have.&nbsp; They still be-



<P>longed to the beginnings of time--had no inherited ex-



<P>perience to teach them as it were), and of course, as



<P>long as there was a piece of paper written over in ac-



<P>cordance with some farcical law or other made down the



<P>river, it didn't enter anybody's head to trouble how



<P>they would live.&nbsp; Certainly they had brought with them



<P>some rotten hippo-meat, which couldn't have lasted very



<P>long, anyway, even if the pilgrims hadn't, in the midst



<P>of a shocking hullabaloo, thrown a considerable quantity



<P>of it overboard.&nbsp; It looked like a high-handed proceed-



<P>ing; but it was really a case of legitimate self-defense.



<P>You can't breathe dead hippo waking, sleeping, and



<P>eating, and at the same time keep your precarious grip



<P>on existence.&nbsp; Besides that, they had given them every



<P>week three pieces of brass wire, each about nine inches



<P>long; and the theory was they were to buy their pro-



<P>visions with that currency in river-side villages.&nbsp; You



<P>can see how THAT worked.&nbsp; There were either no villages,



<P>or the people were hostile, or the director, who like the



<P>rest of us fed out of tins, with an occasional old he-goat



<P>thrown in, didn't want to stop the steamer for some more



<P>or less recondite reason.&nbsp; So, unless they swallowed the



<P>wire itself, or made loops of it to snare the fishes with,



<P>I don't see what good their extravagant salary could be



<P>to them.&nbsp; I must say it was paid with a regularity worthy



<P>of a large and honorable trading company.&nbsp; For the



<P>rest, the only thing to eat--though it didn't look eat-



<P>able in the least--I saw in their possession was a few



<P>lumps of some stuff like half-cooked dough, of a dirty



<P>lavender color, they kept wrapped in leaves, and now and



<P>then swallowed a piece of, but so small that it seemed



<P>done more for the looks of the thing than for any seri-



<P>ous purpose of sustenance.&nbsp; Why in the name of all the



<P>gnawing devils of hunger they didn't go for us--they



<P>were thirty to five--and have a good tuck in for once,



<P>amazes me now when I think of it.&nbsp; They were big



<P>powerful men, with not much capacity to weigh the con-



<P>sequences, with courage, with strength, even yet, though



<P>their skins were no longer glossy and their muscles no



<P>longer hard.&nbsp; And I saw that something restraining, one



<P>of those human secrets that baffle probability, had come



<P>into play there.&nbsp; I looked at them with a swift quicken-



<P>ing of interest--not because it occurred to me I might



<P>be eaten by them before very long, though I own to you



<P>that just then I perceived--in a new light, as it were--



<P>how unwholesome the pilgrims looked, and I hoped, yes,



<P>I positively hoped, that my aspect was not so--what shall



<P>I say?--so--unappetizing: a touch of fantastic vanity



<P>which fitted well with the dream-sensation that pervaded



<P>all my days at that time.&nbsp; Perhaps I had a little fever



<P>too.&nbsp; One can't live with one's finger everlastingly on



<P>one's pulse.&nbsp; I had often 'a little fever,' or a little touch



<P>of other things--the playful paw-strokes of the wilder-



<P>ness, the preliminary trifling before the more serious



<P>onslaught which came in due course.&nbsp; Yes; I looked at



<P>them as you would on any human being, with a curiosity



<P>of their impulses, motives, capacities, weaknesses, when



<P>brought to the test of an inexorable physical necessity.



<P>Restraint!&nbsp; What possible restraint?&nbsp; Was it supersti-



<P>tion, disgust, patience, fear--or some kind of primitive



<P>honor?&nbsp; No fear can stand up to hunger, no patience



<P>can wear it out, disgust simply does not exist where



<P>hunger is; and as to superstition, beliefs, and what you



<P>may call principles, they are less than chaff in a breeze.



<P>Don't you know the devilry of lingering starvation, its



<P>exasperating torment, its black thoughts, its somber and



<P>brooding ferocity?&nbsp; Well, I do.&nbsp; It takes a man all his



<P>inborn strength to fight hunger properly.&nbsp; It's really



<P>easier to face bereavement, dishonor, and the perdition



<P>of one's soul--than this kind of prolonged hunger.&nbsp; Sad,



<P>but true.&nbsp; And these chaps too had no earthly reason



<P>for any kind of scruple.&nbsp; Restraint!&nbsp; I would just as



<P>soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling



<P>amongst the corpses of a battlefield.&nbsp; But there was the



<P>fact facing me--the fact dazzling, to be seen, like the



<P>foam on the depths of the sea, like a ripple on an un-



<P>fathomable enigma, a mystery greater--when I thought



<P>of it--than the curious, inexplicable note of desperate



<P>grief in this savage clamor that had swept by us on the



<P>river-bank, behind the blind whiteness of the fog.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Two pilgrims were quarreling in hurried whispers



<P>as to which bank.&nbsp; 'Left.'&nbsp; 'No, no; how can you?



<P>Right, right, of course.'&nbsp; 'It is very serious,' said the



<P>manager's voice behind me; 'I would be desolated if



<P>anything should happen to Mr. Kurtz before we came



<P>up.'&nbsp; I looked at him, and had not the slightest doubt



<P>he was sincere.&nbsp; He was just the kind of man who would



<P>wish to preserve appearances.&nbsp; That was his restraint.



<P>But when he muttered something about going on at once,



<P>I did not even take the trouble to answer him.&nbsp; I knew,



<P>and he knew, that it was impossible.&nbsp; Were we to let go



<P>our hold of the bottom, we would be absolutely in the



<P>air--in space.&nbsp; We wouldn't be able to tell where we



<P>were going to--whether up or down stream, or across



<P>--till we fetched against one bank or the other,--and



<P>then we wouldn't know at first which it was.&nbsp; Of course



<P>I made no move.&nbsp; I had no mind for a smash-up.&nbsp; You



<P>couldn't imagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck.



<P>Whether drowned at once or not, we were sure to perish



<P>speedily in one way or another.&nbsp; 'I authorize you to



<P>take all the risks,' he said, after a short silence.&nbsp; 'I refuse



<P>to take any,' I said shortly; which was just the answer



<P>he expected, though its tone might have surprised him.



<P>'Well, I must defer to your judgment.&nbsp; You are cap-



<P>tain,' he said, with marked civility.&nbsp; I turned my shoul-



<P>der to him in sign of my appreciation, and looked into



<P>the fog.&nbsp; How long would it last?&nbsp; It was the most hope-



<P>less look-out.&nbsp; The approach to this Kurtz grubbing



<P>for ivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many



<P>dangers as though he had been an enchanted princess



<P>sleeping in a fabulous castle.&nbsp; 'Will they attack, do you



<P>think?' asked the manager, in a confidential tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I did not think they would attack, for several obvious



<P>reasons.&nbsp; The thick fog was one.&nbsp; If they left the bank



<P>in their canoes they would get lost in it, as we would



<P>be if we attempted to move.&nbsp; Still, I had also judged the



<P>jungle of both banks quite impenetrable--and yet eyes



<P>were in it, eyes that had seen us.&nbsp; The river-side bushes



<P>were certainly very thick; but the undergrowth behind



<P>was evidently penetrable.&nbsp; However, during the short



<P>lift I had seen no canoes anywhere in the reach--cer-



<P>tainly not abreast of the steamer.&nbsp; But what made the



<P>idea of attack inconceivable to me was the nature of the



<P>noise--of the cries we had heard.&nbsp; They had not the



<P>fierce character boding of immediate hostile intention.



<P>Unexpected, wild, and violent as they had been, they had



<P>given me an irresistible impression of sorrow.&nbsp; The



<P>glimpse of the steamboat had for some reason filled those



<P>savages with unrestrained grief.&nbsp; The danger, if any,



<P>I expounded, was from our proximity to a great hu-



<P>man passion let loose.&nbsp; Even extreme grief may ulti-



<P>mately vent itself in violence--but more generally takes



<P>the form of apathy. . . .

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You should have seen the pilgrims stare!&nbsp; They had



<P>no heart to grin, or even to revile me; but I believe they



<P>thought me gone mad--with fright, maybe.&nbsp; I delivered



<P>a regular lecture.&nbsp; My dear boys, it was no good bother-



<P>ing.&nbsp; Keep a look-out?&nbsp; Well, you may guess I watched



<P>the fog for the signs of lifting as a cat watches a mouse;



<P>but for anything else our eyes were of no more use to



<P>us than if we had been buried miles deep in a heap of



<P>cotton-wool.&nbsp; It felt like it too--choking, warm, stifling.



<P>Besides, all I said, though it sounded extravagant, was



<P>absolutely true to fact.&nbsp; What we afterwards alluded to



<P>as an attack was really an attempt at repulse.&nbsp; The



<P>action was very far from being aggressive--it was not



<P>even defensive, in the usual sense: it was undertaken



<P>under the stress of desperation, and in its essence was



<P>purely protective.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It developed itself, I should say, two hours after the



<P>fog lifted, and its commencement was at a spot, roughly



<P>speaking, about a mile and a half below Kurtz's station.



<P>We had just floundered and flopped round a bend, when



<P>I saw an islet, a mere grassy hummock of bright green,



<P>in the middle of the stream.&nbsp; It was the only thing of



<P>the kind; but as we opened the reach more, I perceived



<P>it was the head of a long sandbank, or rather of a chain



<P>of shallow patches stretching down the middle of the



<P>river.&nbsp; They were discolored, just awash, and the whole



<P>lot was seen just under the water, exactly as a man's



<P>backbone is seen running down the middle of his back



<P>under the skin.&nbsp; Now, as far as I did see, I could go



<P>to the right or to the left of this.&nbsp; I didn't know either



<P>channel, of course.&nbsp; The banks looked pretty well alike,



<P>the depth appeared the same; but as I had been informed



<P>the station was on the west side, I naturally headed for



<P>the western passage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No sooner had we fairly entered it than I became



<P>aware it was much narrower than I had supposed.&nbsp; To



<P>the left of us there was the long uninterrupted shoal,



<P>and to the right a high, steep bank heavily overgrown



<P>with bushes.&nbsp; Above the bush the trees stood in serried



<P>ranks.&nbsp; The twigs overhung the current thickly, and



<P>from distance to distance a large limb of some tree pro-



<P>jected rigidly over the stream.&nbsp; It was then well on in



<P>the afternoon, the face of the forest was gloomy, and



<P>a broad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water.



<P>In this shadow we steamed up--very slowly, as you may



<P>imagine.&nbsp; I sheered her well inshore--the water being



<P>deepest near the bank, as the sounding-pole informed me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"One of my hungry and forbearing friends was sound-



<P>ing in the bows just below me.&nbsp; This steamboat was



<P>exactly like a decked scow.&nbsp; On the deck there were two



<P>little teak-wood houses, with doors and windows.&nbsp; The



<P>boiler was in the fore-end, and the machinery right



<P>astern.&nbsp; Over the whole there was a light roof, supported



<P>on stanchions.&nbsp; The funnel projected through that roof,



<P>and in front of the funnel a small cabin built of light



<P>planks served for a pilot-house.&nbsp; It contained a couch,



<P>two camp-stools, a loaded Martini-Henry leaning in one



<P>corner, a tiny table, and the steering-wheel.&nbsp; It had a



<P>wide door in front and a broad shutter at each side.&nbsp; All



<P>these were always thrown open, of course.&nbsp; I spent my



<P>days perched up there on the extreme fore-end of that



<P>roof, before the door.&nbsp; At night I slept, or tried to, on



<P>the couch.&nbsp; An athletic black belonging to some coast



<P>tribe, and educated by my poor predecessor, was the



<P>helmsman.&nbsp; He sported a pair of brass earrings, wore a



<P>blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and



<P>thought all the world of himself.&nbsp; He was the most



<P>unstable kind of fool I had ever seen.&nbsp; He steered with



<P>no end of a swagger while you were by; but if he lost



<P>sight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject



<P>funk, and would let that cripple of a steamboat get the



<P>upper hand of him in a minute.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was looking down at the sounding-pole, and feel-



<P>ing much annoyed to see at each try a little more of it



<P>stick out of that river, when I saw my poleman give up



<P>the business suddenly, and stretch himself flat on



<P>the deck, without even taking the trouble to haul his



<P>pole in.&nbsp; He kept hold on it though, and it trailed in



<P>the water.&nbsp; At the same time the fireman, whom I could



<P>also see below me, sat down abruptly before his furnace



<P>and ducked his head.&nbsp; I was amazed.&nbsp; Then I had to look



<P>at the river mighty quick, because there was a snag in



<P>the fairway.&nbsp; Sticks, little sticks, were flying about--



<P>thick: they were whizzing before my nose, dropping be-



<P>low me, striking behind me against my pilot-house.&nbsp; All



<P>this time the river, the shore, the woods, were very quiet--



<P>perfectly quiet.&nbsp; I could only hear the heavy splashing



<P>thump of the stern-wheel and the patter of these things.



<P>We cleared the snag clumsily.&nbsp; Arrows, by Jove!&nbsp; We



<P>were being shot at!&nbsp; I stepped in quickly to close the



<P>shutter on the land side.&nbsp; That fool-helmsman, his hands



<P>on the spokes, was lifting his knees high, stamping his



<P>feet, champing his mouth, like a reined-in horse.&nbsp; Con-



<P>found him!&nbsp; And we were staggering within ten feet of



<P>the bank.&nbsp; I had to lean right out to swing the heavy



<P>shutter, and I saw a face amongst the leaves on the



<P>level with my own, looking at me very fierce and steady;



<P>and then suddenly, as though a veil had been removed



<P>from my eyes, I made out, deep in the tangled gloom,



<P>naked breasts, arms, legs, glaring eyes,--the bush was



<P>swarming with human limbs in movement, glistening, of



<P>bronze color.&nbsp; The twigs shook, swayed, and rustled, the



<P>arrows flew out of them, and then the shutter came to.



<P>'Steer her straight,' I said to the helmsman.&nbsp; He held



<P>his head rigid, face forward; but his eyes rolled, he



<P>kept on lifting and setting down his feet gently, his



<P>mouth foamed a little.&nbsp; 'Keep quiet!' I said in a fury.



<P>I might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway



<P>in the wind.&nbsp; I darted out.&nbsp; Below me there was a great



<P>scuffle of feet on the iron deck; confused exclamations;



<P>a voice screamed, 'Can you turn back?'&nbsp; I caught shape



<P>of a V-shaped ripple on the water ahead.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; An-



<P>other snag!&nbsp; A fusillade burst out under my feet.&nbsp; The



<P>pilgrims had opened with their Winchesters, and were



<P>simply squirting lead into that bush.&nbsp; A deuce of a



<P>lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward.&nbsp; I



<P>swore at it.&nbsp; Now I couldn't see the ripple or the snag



<P>either.&nbsp; I stood in the doorway, peering, and the arrows



<P>came in swarms.&nbsp; They might have been poisoned, but



<P>they looked as though they wouldn't kill a cat.&nbsp; The



<P>bush began to howl.&nbsp; Our wood-cutters raised a warlike



<P>whoop; the report of a rifle just at my back deafened



<P>me.&nbsp; I glanced over my shoulder, and the pilot-house



<P>was yet full of noise and smoke when I made a dash



<P>at the wheel.&nbsp; The fool-nigger had dropped everything,



<P>to throw the shutter open and let off that Martini-Henry.



<P>He stood before the wide opening, glaring, and I yelled



<P>at him to come back, while I straightened the sudden



<P>twist out of that steamboat.&nbsp; There was no room to



<P>turn even if I had wanted to, the snag was somewhere



<P>very near ahead in that confounded smoke, there



<P>was no time to lose, so I just crowded her into the



<P>bank--right into the bank, where I knew the water



<P>was deep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a



<P>whirl of broken twigs and flying leaves.&nbsp; The fusillade



<P>below stopped short, as I had foreseen it would when



<P>the squirts got empty.&nbsp; I threw my head back to a glint-



<P>ing whizz that traversed the pilot-house, in at one shutter-



<P>hole and out at the other.&nbsp; Looking past that mad helms-



<P>man, who was shaking the empty rifle and yelling at



<P>the shore, I saw vague forms of men running bent double,



<P>leaping, gliding, distinct, incomplete, evanescent.&nbsp; Some-



<P>thing big appeared in the air before the shutter, the



<P>rifle went overboard, and the man stepped back swiftly,



<P>looked at me over his shoulder in an extraordinary, pro-



<P>found, familiar manner, and fell upon my feet.&nbsp; The



<P>side of his head hit the wheel twice, and the end of what



<P>appeared a long cane clattered round and knocked over



<P>a little camp-stool.&nbsp; It looked as though after wrench-



<P>ing that thing from somebody ashore he had lost his



<P>balance in the effort.&nbsp; The thin smoke had blown away,



<P>we were clear of the snag, and looking ahead I could see



<P>that in another hundred yards or so I would be free to



<P>sheer off, away from the bank; but my feet felt so very



<P>warm and wet that I had to look down.&nbsp; The man had



<P>rolled on his back and stared straight up at me; both



<P>his hands clutched that cane.&nbsp; It was the shaft of a



<P>spear that, either thrown or lunged through the open-



<P>ing, had caught him in the side just below the ribs; the



<P>blade had gone in out of sight, after making a frightful



<P>gash; my shoes were full; a pool of blood lay very still,



<P>gleaming dark-red under the wheel; his eyes shone with



<P>an amazing luster.&nbsp; The fusillade burst out again.&nbsp; He



<P>looked at me anxiously, gripping the spear like some-



<P>thing precious, with an air of being afraid I would try



<P>to take it away from him.&nbsp; I had to make an effort to



<P>free my eyes from his gaze and attend to the steering.



<P>With one hand I felt above my head for the line of the



<P>steam-whistled, and jerked out screech after screech hur-



<P>riedly.&nbsp; The tumult of angry and warlike yells was



<P>checked instantly, and then from the depths of the woods



<P>went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail of mourn-



<P>ful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow



<P>the flight of the last hope from the earth.&nbsp; There was



<P>a great commotion in the bush; the shower of arrows



<P>stopped, a few dropping shots rang out sharply--then



<P>silence, in which the languid beat of the stern-wheel



<P>came plainly to my ears.&nbsp; I put the helm hard a-star-



<P>board at the moment when the pilgrim in pink pyjamas,



<P>very hot and agitated, appeared in the doorway.&nbsp; 'The



<P>manager sends me--' he began in an official tone, and



<P>stopped short.&nbsp; 'Good God!' he said, glaring at the



<P>wounded man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We two whites stood over him, and his lustrous and



<P>inquiring glance enveloped us both.&nbsp; I declare it looked



<P>as though he would presently put to us some question in



<P>an understandable language; but he died without utter-



<P>ing a sound, without moving a limb, without twitching



<P>a muscle.&nbsp; Only in the very last moment, as though in



<P>response to some sign we could not see, to some whisper



<P>we could not hear, he frowned heavily, and that frown



<P>gave to his black death-mask an inconceivably somber,



<P>brooding, and menacing expression.&nbsp; The luster of in-



<P>quiring glance faded swiftly into vacant glassiness.&nbsp; 'Can



<P>you steer?' I asked the agent eagerly.&nbsp; He looked very



<P>dubious; but I made a grab at his arm, and he under-



<P>stood at once I meant him to steer whether or no.&nbsp; To



<P>tell you the truth, I was morbidly anxious to change



<P>my shoes and socks.&nbsp; 'He is dead,' murmured the fel-



<P>low, immensely impressed.&nbsp; 'No doubt about it,' said I,



<P>tugging like mad at the shoe-laces.&nbsp; 'And, by the way,



<P>I suppose Mr. Kurtz is dead as well by this time.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"For the moment that was the dominant thought.



<P>There was a sense of extreme disappointment, as though



<P>I had found out I had been striving after something al-



<P>together without a substance.&nbsp; I couldn't have been more



<P>disgusted if I had traveled all this way for the sole



<P>purpose of talking with Mr. Kurtz.&nbsp; Talking with.



<P>. . .&nbsp; I flung one shoe overboard, and became aware



<P>that that was exactly what I had been looking forward



<P>to--a talk with Kurtz.&nbsp; I made the strange discovery



<P>that I had never imagined him as doing, you know, but



<P>as discoursing.&nbsp; I didn't say to myself, 'Now I will



<P>never see him,' or 'Now I will never shake him by the



<P>hand,' but, 'Now I will never hear him.'&nbsp; The man pre-



<P>sented himself as a voice.&nbsp; Not of course that I did not



<P>connect him with some sort of action.&nbsp; Hadn't I been



<P>told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration that he



<P>had collected, bartered, swindled, or stolen more ivory



<P>than all the other agents together.&nbsp; That was not the



<P>point.&nbsp; The point was in his being a gifted creature, and



<P>that of all his gifts the one that stood out pre-



<P>eminently, that carried with it a sense of real presence,



<P>was his ability to talk, his words--the gift of expression,



<P>the bewildering, the illuminating, the most exalted and



<P>the most contemptible, the pulsating stream of light, or



<P>the deceitful flow from the heart of an impenetrable



<P>darkness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The other shoe went flying unto the devil-god of that



<P>river.&nbsp; I thought, By Jove! it's all over.&nbsp; We are too



<P>late; he has vanished--the gift has vanished, by means



<P>of some spear, arrow, or club.&nbsp; I will never hear that



<P>chap speak after all,--and my sorrow had a startling



<P>extravagance of emotion, even such as I had noticed in



<P>the howling sorrow of these savages in the bush.&nbsp; I



<P>couldn't have felt more of lonely desolation somehow,



<P>had I been robbed of a belief or had missed my destiny



<P>in life. . . .&nbsp; Why do you sigh in this beastly way,



<P>somebody?&nbsp; Absurd?&nbsp; Well, absurd.&nbsp; Good Lord!



<P>mustn't a man ever--&nbsp; Here, give me some to-



<P>bacco." . . .

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a pause of profound stillness, then a match



<P>flared, and Marlow's lean face appeared, worn, hollow,



<P>with downward folds and dropped eyelids, with an aspect



<P>of concentrated attention; and as he took vigorous draws



<P>at his pipe, it seemed to retreat and advance out of the



<P>night in the regular flicker of the tiny flame.&nbsp; The match



<P>went out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Absurd!" he cried.&nbsp; "This is the worst of trying



<P>to tell. . . .&nbsp; Here you all are, each moored with two



<P>good addresses, like a hulk with two anchors, a butcher



<P>round one corner, a policeman round another, excellent



<P>appetites, and temperature normal--you hear--normal



<P>from year's end to year's end.&nbsp; And you say, Absurd!



<P>Absurd be--exploded!&nbsp; Absurd!&nbsp; My dear boys, what



<P>can you expect from a man who out of sheer nervous-



<P>ness had just flung overboard a pair of new shoes.



<P>Now I think of it, it is amazing I did not shed tears.



<P>I am, upon the whole, proud of my fortitude.&nbsp; I was



<P>cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the inestimable



<P>privilege of listening to the gifted Kurtz.&nbsp; Of course



<P>I was wrong.&nbsp; The privilege was waiting for me.&nbsp; Oh



<P>yes, I heard more than enough.&nbsp; And I was right, too.



<P>A voice.&nbsp; He was very little more than a voice.&nbsp; And



<P>I heard--him--it--this voice--other voices--all of them



<P>were so little more than voices--and the memory of that



<P>time itself lingers around me, impalpable, like a dying



<P>vibration of one immense jabber, silly, atrocious, sordid,



<P>savage, or simply mean, without any kind of sense.



<P>Voices, voices--even the girl herself--now--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was silent for a long time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie," he



<P>began suddenly.&nbsp; "Girl!&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Did I mention a



<P>girl?&nbsp; Oh, she is out of it--completely.&nbsp; They--the



<P>women I mean--are out of it--should be out of it.&nbsp; We



<P>must help them to stay in that beautiful world of their



<P>own, lest ours gets worse.&nbsp; Oh, she had to be out of it.



<P>You should have heard the disinterred body of Mr.



<P>Kurtz saying, 'My Intended.'&nbsp; You would have per-



<P>ceived directly then how completely she was out of it.



<P>And the lofty frontal bone of Mr. Kurtz!&nbsp; They say



<P>the hair goes on growing sometimes, but this--ah--



<P>specimen, was impressively bald.&nbsp; The wilderness had



<P>patted him on the head, and, behold, it was like a ball



<P>--an ivory ball; it had caressed him, and--lo!--he had



<P>withered; it had taken him, loved him, embraced him,



<P>got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed his



<P>soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some



<P>devilish initiation.&nbsp; He was its spoiled and pampered



<P>favorite.&nbsp; Ivory?&nbsp; I should think so.&nbsp; Heaps of it,



<P>stacks of it.&nbsp; The old mud shanty was bursting with it.



<P>You would think there was not a single tusk left either



<P>above or below the ground in the whole country.&nbsp; 'Mostly



<P>fossil,' the manager had remarked disparagingly.&nbsp; It



<P>was no more fossil than I am; but they call it fossil



<P>when it is dug up.&nbsp; It appears these niggers do bury



<P>the tusks sometimes--but evidently they couldn't bury



<P>this parcel deep enough to save the gifted Mr. Kurtz



<P>from his fate.&nbsp; We filled the steamboat with it, and had



<P>to pile a lot on the deck.&nbsp; Thus he could see and enjoy



<P>as long as he could see, because the appreciation of



<P>this favor had remained with him to the last.&nbsp; You should



<P>have heard him say, 'My ivory.'&nbsp; Oh yes, I heard him.



<P>'My Intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my--'



<P>everything belonged to him.&nbsp; It made me hold my breath



<P>in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a



<P>prodigious peal of laughter that would shake the fixed



<P>stars in their places.&nbsp; Everything belonged to him--but



<P>that was a trifle.&nbsp; The thing was to know what he be-



<P>longed to, how many powers of darkness claimed him



<P>for their own.&nbsp; That was the reflection that made you



<P>creepy all over.&nbsp; It was impossible--it was not good for



<P>one either--trying to imagine.&nbsp; He had taken a high



<P>seat amongst the devils of the land--I mean literally.



<P>You can't understand.&nbsp; How could you?--with solid



<P>pavement under your feet, surrounded by kind neigh-



<P>bors ready to cheer you or to fall on you, stepping



<P>delicately between the butcher and the policeman, in the



<P>holy terror of scandal and gallows and lunatic asylums



<P>--how can you imagine what particular region of the



<P>first ages a man's untrammeled feet may take him into



<P>by the way of solitude--utter solitude without a police-



<P>man--by the way of silence, utter silence, where no



<P>warning voice of a kind neighbor can be heard whisper-



<P>ing of public opinion?&nbsp; These little things make all the



<P>great difference.&nbsp; When they are gone you must fall



<P>back upon your own innate strength, upon your own



<P>capacity for faithfulness.&nbsp; Of course you may be too



<P>much of a fool to go wrong--too dull even to know you



<P>are being assaulted by the powers of darkness.&nbsp; I take



<P>it, no fool ever made a bargain for his soul with the



<P>devil: the fool is too much of a fool, or the devil too



<P>much of a devil--I don't know which.&nbsp; Or you may be



<P>such a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether



<P>deaf and blind to anything but heavenly sights and



<P>sounds.&nbsp; Then the earth for you is only a standing place



<P>--and whether to be like this is your loss or your gain I



<P>won't pretend to say.&nbsp; But most of us are neither one



<P>nor the other.&nbsp; The earth for us is a place to live in,



<P>where we must put up with sights, with sounds, with



<P>smells too, by Jove!--breathe dead hippo, so to speak,



<P>and not be contaminated.&nbsp; And there, don't you see?



<P>your strength comes in, the faith in your ability for the



<P>digging of unostentatious holes to bury the stuff in--



<P>your power of devotion, not to yourself, but to an



<P>obscure, back-breaking business.&nbsp; And that's difficult



<P>enough.&nbsp; Mind, I am not trying to excuse or even ex-



<P>plain--I am trying to account to myself for--for--Mr.



<P>Kurtz--for the shade of Mr. Kurtz.&nbsp; This initiated



<P>wraith from the back of Nowhere honored me with its



<P>amazing confidence before it vanished altogether.&nbsp; This



<P>was because it could speak English to me.&nbsp; The original



<P>Kurtz had been educated partly in England, and--as



<P>he was good enough to say himself--his sympathies were



<P>in the right place.&nbsp; His mother was half-English, his



<P>father was half-French.&nbsp; All Europe contributed to the



<P>making of Kurtz; and by-and-by I learned that, most



<P>appropriately, the International Society for the Sup-



<P>pression of Savage Customs had intrusted him with the



<P>making of a report, for its future guidance.&nbsp; And he



<P>had written it too.&nbsp; I've seen it.&nbsp; I've read it.&nbsp; It

was



<P>eloquent, vibrating with eloquence, but too high-strung,



<P>I think.&nbsp; Seventeen pages of close writing he had found



<P>time for!&nbsp; But this must have been before his--let us



<P>say--nerves, went wrong, and caused him to preside at



<P>certain midnight dances ending with unspeakable rites,



<P>which--as far as I reluctantly gathered from what I



<P>heard at various times--were offered up to him--do you



<P>understand?--to Mr. Kurtz himself.&nbsp; But it was a beau-



<P>tiful piece of writing.&nbsp; The opening paragraph, how-



<P>ever, in the light of later information, strikes me now



<P>as ominous.&nbsp; He began with the argument that we whites,



<P>from the point of development we had arrived at, 'must



<P>necessarily appear to them [savages] in the nature of



<P>supernatural beings--we approach them with the might



<P>as of a deity,' and so on, and so on.&nbsp; 'By the simple



<P>exercise of our will we can exert a power for good



<P>practically unbounded,' &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; From that point he



<P>soared and took me with him.&nbsp; The peroration was mag-



<P>nificent, though difficult to remember, you know.&nbsp; It



<P>gave me the notion of an exotic Immensity ruled by



<P>an august Benevolence.&nbsp; It made me tingle with en-



<P>thusiasm.&nbsp; This was the unbounded power of eloquence



<P>--of words--of burning noble words.&nbsp; There were no



<P>practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases,



<P>unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page,



<P>scrawled evidently much later, in an unsteady hand,



<P>may be regarded as the exposition of a method.&nbsp; It



<P>was very simple, and at the end of that moving appeal



<P>to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you, luminous



<P>and terrifying, like a flash of lightning in a serene sky:



<P>'Exterminate all the brutes!'&nbsp; The curious part was



<P>that he had apparently forgotten all about that valu-



<P>able postscriptum, because, later on, when he in a sense



<P>came to himself, he repeatedly entreated me to take



<P>good care of 'my pamphlet' (he called it), as it was



<P>sure to have in the future a good influence upon his



<P>career.&nbsp; I had full information about all these things,



<P>and, besides, as it turned out, I was to have the care of



<P>his memory.&nbsp; I've done enough for it to give me the



<P>indisputable right to lay it, if I choose, for an everlast-



<P>ing rest in the dust-bin of progress, amongst all the



<P>sweepings and, figuratively speaking, all the dead cats



<P>of civilization.&nbsp; But then, you see, I can't choose.&nbsp; He



<P>won't be forgotten.&nbsp; Whatever he was, he was not com-



<P>mon.&nbsp; He had the power to charm or frighten rudi-



<P>mentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in his



<P>honor; he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims



<P>with bitter misgivings: he had one devoted friend at



<P>least, and he had conquered one soul in the world that



<P>was neither rudimentary nor tainted with self-seeking.



<P>No; I can't forget him, though I am not prepared to



<P>affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in



<P>getting to him.&nbsp; I missed my late helmsman awfully,--



<P>I missed him even while his body was still lying in the



<P>pilot-house.&nbsp; Perhaps you will think it passing strange



<P>this regret for a savage who was no more account than



<P>a grain of sand in a black Sahara.&nbsp; Well, don't you see,



<P>he had done something, he had steered; for months I



<P>had him at my back--a help--an instrument.&nbsp; It was



<P>a kind of partnership.&nbsp; He steered for me--I had to



<P>look after him, I worried about his deficiencies, and thus



<P>a subtle bond had been created, of which I only became



<P>aware when it was suddenly broken.&nbsp; And the intimate



<P>profundity of that look he gave me when he received



<P>his hurt remains to this day in my memory--like a claim



<P>of distant kinship affirmed in a supreme moment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor fool!&nbsp; If he had only left that shutter alone.



<P>He had no restraint, no restraint--just like Kurtz--a



<P>tree swayed by the wind.&nbsp; As soon as I had put on a dry



<P>pair of slippers, I dragged him out, after first jerking



<P>the spear out of his side, which operation I confess I



<P>performed with my eyes shut tight.&nbsp; His heels leaped



<P>together over the little door-step; his shoulders were



<P>pressed to my breast; I hugged him from behind des-



<P>perately.&nbsp; Oh! he was heavy, heavy; heavier than any



<P>man on earth, I should imagine.&nbsp; Then without more



<P>ado I tipped him overboard.&nbsp; The current snatched him



<P>as though he had been a wisp of grass, and I saw the



<P>body roll over twice before I lost sight of it for ever.



<P>All the pilgrims and the manager were then congregated



<P>on the awning-deck about the pilot-house, chattering at



<P>each other like a flock of excited magpies, and there was



<P>a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude.



<P>What they wanted to keep that body hanging about for



<P>I can't guess.&nbsp; Embalm it, maybe.&nbsp; But I had also heard



<P>another, and a very ominous, murmur on the deck below.



<P>My friends the wood-cutters were likewise scandalized,



<P>and with a better show of reason--though I admit that



<P>the reason itself was quite inadmissible.&nbsp; Oh, quite!&nbsp; I



<P>had made up my mind that if my late helmsman was to



<P>be eaten, the fishes alone should have him.&nbsp; He had



<P>been a very second-rate helmsman while alive, but now



<P>he was dead he might have become a first-class tempta-



<P>tion, and possibly cause some startling trouble.&nbsp; Besides,



<P>I was anxious to take the wheel, the man in pink pyjamas



<P>showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This I did directly the simple funeral was over.&nbsp; We



<P>were going half-speed, keeping right in the middle of



<P>the stream, and I listened to the talk about me.&nbsp; They



<P>had given up Kurtz, they had given up the station;



<P>Kurtz was dead, and the station had been burnt--and



<P>so on--and so on.&nbsp; The red-haired pilgrim was beside



<P>himself with the thought that at least this poor Kurtz



<P>had been properly revenged.&nbsp; 'Say!&nbsp; We must have



<P>made a glorious slaughter of them in the bush.&nbsp; Eh?



<P>What do you think?&nbsp; Say?'&nbsp; He positively danced, the



<P>bloodthirsty little gingery beggar.&nbsp; And he had nearly



<P>fainted when he saw the wounded man!&nbsp; I could not



<P>help saying, 'You made a glorious lot of smoke, any-



<P>how.'&nbsp; I had seen, from the way the tops of the bushes



<P>rustled and flew, that almost all the shots had gone too



<P>high.&nbsp; You can't hit anything unless you take aim and



<P>fire from the shoulder; but these chaps fired from the



<P>hip with their eyes shut.&nbsp; The retreat, I maintained--



<P>and I was right--was caused by the screeching of the



<P>steam-whistle.&nbsp; Upon this they forgot Kurtz, and began



<P>to howl at me with indignant protests.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The manager stood by the wheel murmuring confi-



<P>dentially about the necessity of getting well away down



<P>the river before dark at all events, when I saw in the



<P>distance a clearing on the river-side and the outlines of



<P>some sort of building.&nbsp; 'What's this?' I asked.&nbsp; He



<P>clapped his hands in wonder.&nbsp; 'The station!' he cried.



<P>I edged in at once, still going half-speed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Through my glasses I saw the slope of a hill inter-



<P>spersed with rare trees and perfectly free from under-



<P>growth.&nbsp; A long decaying building on the summit was



<P>half buried in the high grass; the large holes in the



<P>peaked roof gaped black from afar; the jungle and



<P>the woods made a background.&nbsp; There was no inclosure



<P>or fence of any kind; but there had been one apparently,



<P>for near the house half-a-dozen slim posts remained in



<P>a row, roughly trimmed, and with their upper ends orna-



<P>mented with round carved balls.&nbsp; The rails, or what-



<P>ever there had been between, had disappeared.&nbsp; Of



<P>course the forest surrounded all that.&nbsp; The river-bank



<P>was clear, and on the water-side I saw a white man under



<P>a hat like a cart-wheel beckoning persistently with his



<P>whole arm.&nbsp; Examining the edge of the forest above and



<P>below, I was almost certain I could see movements--



<P>human forms gliding here and there.&nbsp; I steamed past



<P>prudently, then stopped the engines and let her drift



<P>down.&nbsp; The man on the shore began to shout, urging us



<P>to land.&nbsp; 'We have been attacked,' screamed the man-



<P>ager.&nbsp; 'I know--I know.&nbsp; It's all right,' yelled back the



<P>other, as cheerful as you please.&nbsp; 'Come along.&nbsp; It's all



<P>right.&nbsp; I am glad.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"His aspect reminded me of something I had seen--



<P>something funny I had seen somewhere.&nbsp; As I maneuvered



<P>to get alongside, I was asking myself, 'What does this



<P>fellow look like?'&nbsp; Suddenly I got it.&nbsp; He looked like a



<P>harlequin.&nbsp; His clothes had been made of some stuff



<P>that was brown holland probably, but it was covered with



<P>patches all over, with bright patches, blue, red, and yel-



<P>low,--patches on the back, patches on front, patches on



<P>elbows, on knees; colored binding round his jacket, scar-



<P>let edging at the bottom of his trousers; and the sun-



<P>shine made him look extremely gay and wonderfully neat



<P>withal, because you could see how beautifully all this



<P>patching had been done.&nbsp; A beardless, boyish face, very



<P>fair, no features to speak of, nose peeling, little blue



<P>eyes, smiles and frowns chasing each other over that



<P>open countenance like sunshine and shadow on a wind-



<P>swept plain.&nbsp; 'Look out, captain!' he cried; 'there's a



<P>snag lodged in here last night.'&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Another



<P>snag?&nbsp; I confess I swore shamefully.&nbsp; I had nearly holed



<P>my cripple, to finish off that charming trip.&nbsp; The harle-



<P>quin on the bank turned his little pug nose up to me.



<P>'You English?' he asked, all smiles.&nbsp; 'Are you?' I



<P>shouted from the wheel.&nbsp; The smiles vanished, and he



<P>shook his head as if sorry for my disappointment.&nbsp; Then



<P>he brightened up.&nbsp; 'Never mind!' he cried encourag-



<P>ingly.&nbsp; 'Are we in time?' I asked.&nbsp; 'He is up there,'



<P>he replied, with a toss of the head up the hill, and



<P>becoming gloomy all of a sudden.&nbsp; His face was like



<P>the autumn sky, overcast one moment and bright the



<P>next.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When the manager, escorted by the pilgrims, all of



<P>them armed to the teeth, had gone to the house, this



<P>chap came on board.&nbsp; 'I say, I don't like this.&nbsp; These



<P>natives are in the bush,' I said.&nbsp; He assured me earnestly



<P>it was all right.&nbsp; 'They are simple people,' he added;



<P>'well, I am glad you came.&nbsp; It took me all my time to



<P>keep them off.'&nbsp; 'But you said it was all right,' I cried.



<P>'Oh, they meant no harm,' he said; and as I stared he



<P>corrected himself, 'Not exactly.'&nbsp; Then vivaciously,



<P>'My faith, your pilot-house wants a clean up!'&nbsp; In the



<P>next breath he advised me to keep enough steam on the



<P>boiler to blow the whistle in case of any trouble.&nbsp; 'One



<P>good screech will do more for you than all your rifles.



<P>They are simple people,' he repeated.&nbsp; He rattled away



<P>at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me.&nbsp; He seemed to



<P>be trying to make up for lots of silence, and actually



<P>hinted, laughing, that such was the case.&nbsp; 'Don't you



<P>talk with Mr. Kurtz?' I said.&nbsp; 'You don't talk with



<P>that man--you listen to him,' he exclaimed with severe



<P>exaltation.&nbsp; 'But now--'&nbsp; He waved his arm, and in



<P>the twinkling of an eye was in the uttermost depths of



<P>despondency.&nbsp; In a moment he came up again with a



<P>jump, possessed himself of both my hands, shook them



<P>continuously, while he gabbled: 'Brother sailor . . .



<P>honor . . . pleasure . . . delight . . . introduce



<P>myself . . . Russian . . . son of an arch-priest



<P>. . . Government of Tambov . . .&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Tobacco!



<P>English tobacco; the excellent English tobacco!&nbsp; Now,



<P>that's brotherly.&nbsp; Smoke?&nbsp; Where's a sailor that does



<P>not smoke?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The pipe soothed him, and gradually I made out he



<P>had run away from school, had gone to sea in a Russian



<P>ship; ran away again; served some time in English



<P>ships; was now reconciled with the arch-priest.&nbsp; He made



<P>a point of that.&nbsp; 'But when one is young one must see



<P>things, gather experience, ideas; enlarge the mind.'



<P>'Here!' I interrupted.&nbsp; 'You can never tell!&nbsp; Here I



<P>have met Mr. Kurtz,' he said, youthfully solemn and



<P>reproachful.&nbsp; I held my tongue after that.&nbsp; It appears



<P>he had persuaded a Dutch trading-house on the coast



<P>to fit him out with stores and goods, and had started for



<P>the interior with a light heart, and no more idea of what



<P>would happen to him than a baby.&nbsp; He had been wan-



<P>dering about that river for nearly two years alone, cut



<P>off from everybody and everything.&nbsp; 'I am not so young



<P>as I look.&nbsp; I am twenty-five,' he said.&nbsp; 'At first old Van



<P>Shuyten would tell me to go to the devil,' he narrated



<P>with keen enjoyment; 'but I stuck to him, and talked



<P>and talked, till at last he got afraid I would talk the



<P>hind-leg off his favorite dog, so he gave me some cheap



<P>things and a few guns, and told me he hoped he would



<P>never see my face again.&nbsp; Good old Dutchman, Van



<P>Shuyten.&nbsp; I've sent him one small lot of ivory a year



<P>ago, so that he can't call me a little thief when I get



<P>back.&nbsp; I hope he got it.&nbsp; And for the rest I don't care.



<P>I had some wood stacked for you.&nbsp; That was my old



<P>house.&nbsp; Did you see?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I gave him Towson's book.&nbsp; He made as though he



<P>would kiss me, but restrained himself.&nbsp; 'The only book



<P>I had left, and I thought I had lost it,' he said, looking



<P>at it ecstatically.&nbsp; 'So many accidents happen to a man



<P>going about alone, you know.&nbsp; Canoes get upset some-



<P>times--and sometimes you've got to clear out so quick



<P>when the people get angry.'&nbsp; He thumbed the pages.



<P>'You made notes in Russian?' I asked.&nbsp; He nodded.



<P>'I thought they were written in cipher,' I said.&nbsp; He



<P>laughed, then became serious.&nbsp; 'I had lots of trouble



<P>to keep these people off,' he said.&nbsp; 'Did they want to



<P>kill you?' I asked.&nbsp; 'Oh no!' he cried, and checked him-



<P>self.&nbsp; 'Why did they attack us?' I pursued.&nbsp; He hesi-



<P>tated, then said shamefacedly, 'They don't want him to



<P>go.'&nbsp; 'Don't they?' I said, curiously.&nbsp; He nodded a



<P>nod full of mystery and wisdom.&nbsp; 'I tell you,' he cried,



<P>'this man has enlarged my mind.'&nbsp; He opened his arms



<P>wide, staring at me with his little blue eyes that were



<P>perfectly round."
