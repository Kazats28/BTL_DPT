<P>S'doaks was son of Yelth the wise--

<BR>Chief of the Raven clan.

<BR>Itswoot the Bear had him in care

<BR>To make him a medicine-man.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was quick and quicker to learn--

<BR>Bold and bolder to dare:

<BR>He danced the dread Klo-Kwallie Dance

<BR>To tickle Itswoot the Bear!



<P><I>Oregon Legend</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

Kim flung himself whole-heartedly upon the next turn of the wheel. He would

be a Sahib again for a while. In that idea, so soon as he had reached the

broad road under Simla Town Hall, he cast about for one to impress. A Hindu

child, some ten years old, squatted under a lamp-post.



<P>`Where is Mr Lurgan's house?' demanded Kim.



<P>`I do not understand English,' was the answer, and Kim shifted his speech

accordingly.



<P>`I will show.'



<P>Together they set off through the mysterious dusk, full of the noises

of a city below the hillside, and the breath of a cool wind in deodar-crowned

Jakko, shouldering the stars. The house-lights, scattered on every level,

made, as it were, a double firmament. Some were fixed, others belonged

to the 'rickshaws of the careless, open-spoken English folk, going out

to dinner.



<P>`It is here,' said Kim's guide, and halted in a veranda flush with the

main road. No door stayed them, but a curtain of beaded reeds that split

up the lamplight beyond.



<P>`He is come,' said the boy, in a voice little louder than a sigh, and

vanished. Kim felt sure that the boy had been posted to guide him from

the first, but, putting a bold face on it, parted the curtain. A black-bearded

man, with a green shade over his eyes, sat at a table, and, one by one,

with short, white hands, picked up globules of light from a tray before

him, threaded them on a glancing silken string, and hummed to himself the

while. Kim was conscious that beyond the circle of light the room was full

of things that smelt like all the temples of all the East. A whiff of musk,

a puff of sandal-wood, and a breath of sickly jessamine-oil caught his

opened nostrils.



<P>`I am here,' said Kim at last, speaking in the vernacular: the smells

made him forget that he was to be a Sahib.



<P>`Seventy-nine, eighty, eighty-one,' the man counted to himself; stringing

pearl after pearl so quickly that Kim could scarcely follow his fingers.

He slid off the green shade and looked fixedly at Kim for a full half-minute.

The pupils of the eye dilated and closed to pin-pricks, as if at will.

There was a <I>fakir</I> by the Taksali Gate who had just this gift and

made money by it, especially when cursing silly women. Kim stared with

interest. His disreputable friend could further twitch his ears, almost

like a goat, and Kim was disappointed that this new man could not imitate

him.



<P>`Do not be afraid,' said Lurgan Sahib suddenly.



<P>`Why should I fear?'



<P>`Thou wilt sleep here tonight, and stay with me till it is time to go

again to Nucklao. It is an order.'



<P>`It is an order,' Kim repeated. `But where shall I sleep?'



<P>`Here, in this room.' Lurgan Sahib waved his hand towards the darkness

behind him.



<P>`So be it,' said Kim composedly. `Now?'



<P>He nodded and held the lamp above his head. As the light swept them,

there leaped out from the walls a collection of Tibetan devil-dance masks,

hanging above the fiend-embroidered draperies of those ghastly functions

- horned masks, scowling masks, and masks of idiotic terror. In a corner,

a Japanese warrior, mailed and plumed, menaced him with a halberd, and

a score of lances and <I>khandas</I> and <I>kuttars</I> gave back the unsteady

gleam. But what interested Kim more than all these things - he had seen

devil-dance masks at the Lahore Museum - was a glimpse of the soft-eyed

Hindu child who had left him in the doorway, sitting cross-legged under

the table of pearls with a little smile on his scarlet lips.



<P>`I think that Lurgan Sahib wishes to make me afraid. And I am sure that

that devil's brat below the table wishes to see me afraid. This place,'

he said aloud, `is like a Wonder House. Where is my bed?'



<P>Lurgan Sahib pointed to a native quilt in a corner by the loathsome

masks, picked up the lamp, and left the room black.



<P>`Was that Lurgan Sahib?' Kim asked as he cuddled down. No answer. He

could hear the Hindu boy breathing, however, and, guided by the sound,

crawled across the floor, and cuffed into the darkness, crying: `Give answer,

devil! Is this the way to lie to a Sahib?'



<P>From the darkness he fancied he could hear the echo of a chuckle. It

could not be his soft-fleshed companion, because he was weeping. So Kim

lifted up his voice and called aloud: `Lurgan Sahib! O Lurgan Sahib! Is

it an order that thy servant does not speak to me?'



<P>`It is an order.' The voice came from behind him and he started.



<P>`Very good. But remember,' he muttered, as he resought the quilt, `I

will beat thee in the morning. I do not love Hindus.'



<P>That was no cheerful night; the room being overfull of voices and music.

Kim was waked twice by someone calling his name. The second time he set

out in search, and ended by bruising his nose against a box that certainly

spoke with a human tongue, but in no sort of human accent. It seemed to

end in a tin trumpet and to be joined by wires to a smaller box on the

floor - so far, at least, as he could judge by touch. And the voice, very

hard and whirring, came out of the trumpet. Kim rubbed his nose and grew

furious, thinking, as usual, in Hindi.



<P>`This with a beggar from the bazar might be good, but - I am a Sahib

and the son of a Sahib and, which is twice as much more beside, a student

of Nucklao. Yess' (here he turned to English), `a boy of St Xavier's. Damn

Mr Lurgan's eyes! - It is some sort of machinery like a sewing-machine.

Oh, it is a <I>great</I> cheek of him - we are not frightened that way

at Lucknow - No!' Then in Hindi: `But what does <I>he</I> gain? He is only

a trader - I am in his shop. But Creighton Sahib is a Colonel - and I think

Creighton Sahib gave orders that it should be done. <I>How</I> I will beat

that Hindu in the morning! What is this?'



<P>The trumpet-box was pouring out a string of the most elaborate abuse

that even Kim had ever heard, in a high uninterested voice, that for a

moment lifted the short hairs of his neck. When the vile thing drew breath,

Kim was reassured by the soft, sewing-machine-like whirr.



<P>`<I>Ch&ucirc;p</I>! [Be still]' he cried, and again he heard a chuckle

that decided him. `<I>Ch&ucirc;p</I> - or I break your head.'



<P>The box took no heed. Kim wrenched at the tin trumpet and something

lifted with a click. He had evidently raised a lid. If there were a devil

inside, now was its time, for - he sniffed - thus did the sewing-machines

of the bazar smell. He would clean that <I>shaitan.</I> He slipped off

his jacket, and plunged it into the box's mouth. Something long and round

bent under the pressure, there was a whirr and the voice stopped - as voices

must if you ram a thrice-doubled coat on to the wax cylinder and into the

works of an expensive phonograph. Kim finished his slumbers with a serene

mind.



<P>In the morning he was aware of Lurgan Sahib looking down on him.



<P>`Oah!' said Kim, firmly resolved to cling to his Sahib-dom. `There was

a box in the night that gave me bad talk. So I stopped it. Was it your

box?'



<P>The man held out his hand.



<P>`Shake hands, O'Hara,' he said. `Yes, it was my box. I keep such things

because my friends the Rajahs like them. That one is broken, but it was

cheap at the price. Yes, my friends, the Kings, are very fond of toys -

and so am I sometimes.'



<P>Kim looked him over out of the corners of his eyes. He was a Sahib in

that he wore Sahib's clothes; the accent of his Urdu, the intonation of

his English, showed that he was anything but a Sahib. He seemed to understand

what moved in Kim's mind ere the boy opened his mouth, and he took no pains

to explain himself as did Father Victor or the Lucknow masters. Sweetest

of all - he treated Kim as an equal on the Asiatic side.



<P>`I am sorry you cannot beat my boy this morning. He says he will kill

you with a knife or poison. He is jealous, so I have put him in the corner

and I shall not speak to him today. He has just tried to kill me. You must

help me with the breakfast. He is almost too jealous to trust, just now.'



<P>Now a genuine imported Sahib from England would have made a great to-do

over this tale. Lurgan Sahib stated it as simply as Mahbub Ali was used

to record his little affairs in the North.



<P>The back veranda of the shop was built out over the sheer hillside,

and they looked down into their neighbours' chimney-pots, as is the custom

of Simla. But even more than the purely Persian meal cooked by Lurgan Sahib

with his own hands, the shop fascinated Kim. The Lahore Museum was larger,

but here were more wonders - ghost-daggers and prayer-wheels from Tibet;

turquoise and raw amber necklaces; green jade bangles; curiously packed

incense-sticks in jars crusted over with raw garnets; the devil-masks of

overnight and a wall full of peacock-blue draperies; gilt figures of Buddha,

and little portable lacquer altars; Russian samovars with turquoises on

the lid; egg-shell china sets in quaint octagonal cane boxes; yellow ivory

crucifixes - from Japan of all places in the world, so Lurgan Sahib said;

carpets in dusty bales, smelling atrociously, pushed back behind torn and

rotten screens of geometrical work; Persian water-jugs for the hands after

meals; dull copper incense-burners neither Chinese nor Persian, with friezes

of fantastic devils running round them; tarnished silver belts that knotted

like raw hide; hairpins of jade, ivory, and plasma; arms of all sorts and

kinds, and a thousand other oddments were cased, or piled, or merely thrown

into the room, leaving a clear space only round the rickety deal table,

where Lurgan Sahib worked.



<P>`Those things are nothing,' said his host, following Kim's glance. `I

buy them because they are pretty, and sometimes I sell - if I like the

buyer's look. My work is on the table - some of it.'



<P>It blazed in the morning light - all red and blue and green flashes,

picked out with the vicious blue-white spurt of a diamond here and there.

Kim opened his eyes.



<P>`Oh, they are quite well, those stones. It will not hurt them to take

the sun. Besides, they are cheap. But with sick stones it is very different.'

He piled Kim's plate anew. `There is no one but me can doctor a sick pearl

and re-blue turquoises. I grant you opals - any fool can cure an opal -

but for a sick pearl there is only me. Suppose I were to die! Then there

would be no one... Oh no! <I>You</I> cannot do anything with jewels. It

will be quite enough if you understand a little about the Turquoise - some

day.'



<P>He moved to the end of the veranda to refill the heavy, porous clay

water-jug from the filter.



<P>`Do you want drink?'



<P>Kim nodded. Lurgan Sahib, fifteen feet off; laid one hand on the jar.

Next instant, it stood at Kim's elbow, full to within half an inch of the

brim - the white cloth only showing, by a small wrinkle, where it had slid

into place.



<P>`Wah!' said Kim in most utter amazement. `That is magic.' Lurgan Sahib's

smile showed that the compliment had gone home.



<P>`Throw it back.'



<P>`It will break.'



<P>`I say, throw it back.'



<P>Kim pitched it at random. It fell short and crashed into fifty pieces,

while the water dripped through the rough veranda boarding.



<P>`I said it would break.'



<P>`All one. Look at it. Look at the largest piece.'



<P>That lay with a sparkle of water in its curve, as it were a star on

the floor. Kim looked intently. Lurgan Sahib laid one hand gently on the

nape of his neck, stroked it twice or thrice, and whispered: `Look! It

shall come to life again, piece by piece. First the big piece shall join

itself to two others on the right and the left - on the right and the left.

Look!'



<P>To save his life, Kim could not have turned his head. The light touch

held him as in a vice, and his blood tingled pleasantly through him. There

was one large piece of the jar where there had been three, and above them

the shadowy outline of the entire vessel. He could see the veranda through

it, but it was thickening and darkening with each beat of his pulse. Yet

the jar - how slowly the thoughts came! - the jar had been smashed before

his eyes. Another wave of prickling fire raced down his neck, as Lurgan

Sahib moved his hand.



<P>`Look! It is coming into shape,' said Lurgan Sahib.



<P>So far Kim had been thinking in Hindi, but a tremor came on him, and

with an effort like that of a swimmer before sharks, who hurls himself

half out of the water, his mind leaped up from a darkness that was swallowing

it and took refuge in - the multiplication-table in English!



<P>`Look! It is coming into shape,' whispered Lurgan Sahib.



<P>The jar had been smashed - yess, smashed - not the native word, he would

not think of that - but smashed - into fifty pieces, and twice three was

six, and thrice three was nine, and four times three was twelve. He clung

desperately to the repetition. The shadow-outline of the jar cleared like

a mist after rubbing eyes. There were the broken shards; there was the

spilt water drying in the sun, and through the cracks of the veranda showed,

all ribbed, the white house-wall below - and thrice twelve was thirty-six!



<P>`Look! Is it coming into shape?' asked Lurgan Sahib.



<P>`But it <I>is</I> smashed - smashed,' he gasped - Lurgan Sahib had been

muttering softly for the last half-minute. Kim wrenched his head aside.

`Look! <I>Dekho</I>! It is there as it was there.'



<P>`It is there as it was there,' said Lurgan, watching Kim closely while

the boy rubbed his neck. `But you are the first of many who has ever seen

it so.' He wiped his broad forehead.



<P>`Was that more magic?' Kim asked suspiciously. The tingle had gone from

his veins; he felt unusually wide awake.



<P>`No, that was not magic. It was only to see if there was - a flaw in

a jewel. Sometimes very fine jewels will fly all to pieces if a man holds

them in his hand, and knows the proper way. That is why one must be careful

before one sets them. Tell me, did you see the shape of the pot?'



<P>`For a little time. It began to grow like a flower from the ground.'



<P>`And then what did you do? I mean, how did you think?'



<P>`Oah! I knew it was broken, and so, I think, that was what I thought

- and it <I>was</I> broken.'



<P>`Hm! Has anyone ever done that same sort of magic to you before?'



<P>`If it was,' said Kim `do you think I should let it again? I should

run away.'



<P>`And now you are not afraid - eh?'



<P>`Not now.'



<P>Lurgan Sahib looked at him more closely than ever. `I shall ask Mahbub

Ali - not now, but some day later,' he muttered. `I am pleased with you

- yes; and I am pleased with you - no. You are the first that ever saved

himself. I wish I knew what it was that... But you are right. You should

not tell that - not even to me.'



<P>He turned into the dusky gloom of the shop, and sat down at the table,

rubbing his hands softly. A small, husky sob came from behind a pile of

carpets. It was the Hindu child obediently facing towards the wall. His

thin shoulders worked with grief.



<P>`Ah! He is jealous, so jealous. I wonder if he will try to poison me

again in my breakfast, and make me cook it twice.'



<P>`<I>Kubbee - kubbee nahin</I> [Never - never. No!]', came the broken

answer.



<P>`And whether he will kill this other boy?'



<P>`<I>Kubbee - kubbee nahin</I>.'



<P>`What do <I>you</I> think he will do?' He turned suddenly on Kim.



<P>`Oah! I do not know. Let him go, perhaps. Why did he want to poison

you?'



<P>`Because he is so fond of me. Suppose you were fond of someone, and

you saw someone come, and the man you were fond of was more pleased with

him than he was with you, what would you do?'



<P>Kim thought. Lurgan repeated the sentence slowly in the vernacular.



<P>`I should not poison that man,' said Kim reflectively, `but I should

beat that boy - <I>if</I> that boy was fond of my man. But first, I would

ask that boy if it were true.'



<P>`Ah! He thinks everyone must be fond of me.'



<P>`Then I think he is a fool.'



<P>`Hearest thou?' said Lurgan Sahib to the shaking shoulders. `The Sahib's

son thinks thou art a little fool. Come out, and next time thy heart is

troubled, do not try white arsenic quite so openly. Surely the Devil Dasim

was lord of our table-cloth that day! It might have made me ill, child,

and then a stranger would have guarded the jewels. Come!'



<P>The child, heavy-eyed with much weeping, crept out from behind the bale

and flung himself passionately at Lurgan Sahib's feet, with an extravagance

of remorse that impressed even Kim.



<P>`I will look into the ink-pools - I will faithfully guard the jewels!

Oh, my Father and my Mother, send <I>him</I> away!' He indicated Kim with

a backward jerk of his bare heel.



<P>`Not yet - not yet. In a little while he will go away again. But now

he is at school - at a new <I>madrissah</I> and thou shalt be his teacher.

Play the Play of the Jewels against him. I will keep tally.'



<P>The child dried his tears at once, and dashed to the back of the shop,

whence he returned with a copper tray.



<P>`Give me!' he said to Lurgan Sahib. `Let them come from thy hand, for

he may say that I knew them before.'



<P>`Gently - gently,' the man replied, and from a drawer under the table

dealt a half-handful of clattering trifles into the tray.



<P>`Now,' said the child, waving an old newspaper. `Look on them as long

as thou wilt, stranger. Count and, if need be, handle. One look is enough

for me.' He turned his back proudly.



<P>`But what is the game?'



<P>`When thou hast counted and handled and art sure that thou canst remember

them all, I cover them with this paper, and thou must tell over the tally

to Lurgan Sahib. <I>I</I> will write mine.'



<P>`Oah!' The instinct of competition waked in his breast. He bent over

the tray. There were but fifteen stones on it. `That is easy,' he said

after a minute. The child slipped the paper over the winking jewels and

scribbled in a native account-book.



<P>`There are under that paper five blue stones - one big, one smaller,

and three small,' said Kim, all in haste. `There are four green stones,

and one with a hole in it; there is one yellow stone that I can see through,

and one like a pipe-stem. There are two red stones, and - and - I made

the count fifteen, but two I have forgotten. No! Give me time. One was

of ivory, little and brownish; and - and - give me time... '



<P>`One - two' - Lurgan Sahib counted him out up to ten. Kim shook his

head.



<P>`Hear my count!' the child burst in, trilling with laughter. `First,

are two flawed sapphires - one of two ruttees and one of four as I should

judge. The four-ruttee sapphire is chipped at the edge. There is one Turkestan

turquoise, plain with black veins, and there are two inscribed - one with

a Name of God in gilt, and the other being cracked across, for it came

out of an old ring, I cannot read. We have now all five blue stones. Four

flawed emeralds there are, but one is drilled in two places, and one is

a little carven - '



<P>`Their weights?' said Lurgan Sahib impassively.



<P>`Three - five - five - and four ruttees as I judge it. There is one

piece of old greenish pipe amber, and a cut topaz from Europe. There is

one ruby of Burma, of two ruttees, without a flaw, and there is a balas-ruby,

flawed, of two ruttees. There is a carved ivory from China representing

a rat sucking an egg; and there is last-ah ha!-a ball of crystal as big

as a bean set on a gold leaf.'



<P>He clapped his hands at the close.



<P>`He is thy master,' said Lurgan Sahib, smiling.



<P>`Huh! He knew the names of the stones,' said Kim, flushing. `Try again!

With common things such as he and I both know.'



<P>They heaped the tray again with odds and ends gathered from the shop,

and even the kitchen, and every time the child won, till Kim marvelled.



<P>`Bind my eyes - let me feel once with my fingers, and even <I>then</I>

I will leave thee opened-eyed behind,' he challenged.



<P>Kim stamped with vexation when the lad made his boast good.



<P>`If it were men - or horses,' he said, `I could do better. This playing

with tweezers and knives and scissors is too little.'



<P>`Learn first - teach later,' said Lurgan Sahib. `Is he thy master?'



<P>`Truly. But how is it done?'



<P>`By doing it many times over till it is done perfectly - for it is worth

doing.'



<P>The Hindu boy, in highest feather, actually patted Kim on the back.



<P>`Do not despair,' he said. `I myself will teach thee.'



<P>`And I will see that thou art well taught,' said Lurgan Sahib, still

speaking in the vernacular, `for except my boy here - it was foolish of

him to buy so much white arsenic when, if he had asked, I could have given

it - except my boy here I have not in a long time met with one better worth

teaching. And there are ten days more ere thou canst return to Lucknao

where they teach nothing - at the long price. We shall, I think, be friends.'



<P>They were a most mad ten days, but Kim enjoyed himself too much to reflect

on their craziness. In the morning they played the Jewel Game - sometimes

with veritable stones, sometimes with piles of swords and daggers, sometimes

with photo graphs of natives. Through the afternoons he and the Hindu boy

would mount guard in the shop, sitting dumb behind a carpet-bale or a screen

and watching Mr Lurgan's many and very curious visitors. There were small

Rajahs, escorts coughing in the veranda, who came to buy curiosities -

such as phone graphs and mechanical toys. There were ladies in search of

necklaces, and men, it seemed to Kim - but his mind may have been vitiated

by early training - in search of the ladies; natives from independent and

feudatory Courts whose ostensible business was the repair of broken necklaces

- rivers of light poured out upon the table - but whose true end seemed

to be to raise money for angry Maharanees or young Rajahs. There were Babus

to whom Lurgan Sahib talked with austerity and authority, but at the end

of each interview he gave them money in coined silver and currency notes.

There were occasional gatherings' of long-coated theatrical natives who

discussed metaphysics in English and Bengali, to Mr Lurgan's great edification.

He was always interested in religions. At the end of the day, Kim and the

Hindu boy - whose name varied at Lurgan's pleasure - were expected to give

a detailed account of all that they had seen and heard - their view of

each man's character, as shown in his face, talk, and manner, and their

notions of his real errand. After dinner, Lurgan Sahib's fancy turned more

to what might be called dressing-up, in which game he took a most informing

interest. He could paint faces to a marvel; with a brush-dab here and a

line there changing them past recognition. The shop was full of all manner

of dresses and turbans, and Kim was apparelled variously as a young Mohammedan

of good family, an oilman, and once - which was a joyous evening - as the

son of an Oudh landholder in the fullest of full dress. Lurgan Sahib had

a hawk's eye to detect the least flaw in the make-up; and lying on a worn

teak-wood couch, would explain by the half-hour together how such and such

a caste talked, or walked, or coughed, or spat, or sneezed, and, since

<I>hows</I> matter little in this world, the <I>why</I> of everything.

The Hindu child played this game clumsily. That little mind, keen as an

icicle where tally of jewels was concerned, could not temper itself to

enter another's soul; but a demon in Kim woke up and sang with joy as he

put on the changing dresses, and changed speech and gesture therewith.



<P>Carried away by enthusiasm, he volunteered to show Lurgan Sahib one

evening how the disciples of a certain caste of <I>fakir</I>, old Lahore

acquaintances, begged doles by the roadside; and what sort of language

he would use to an Englishman, to a Punjabi farmer going to a fair, and

to a woman without a veil. Lurgan Sahib laughed immensely, and begged Kim

to stay as he was, immobile for half an hour - cross-legged, ash-smeared,

and wild-eyed, in the back room. At the end of that time entered a hulking,

obese Babu whose stockinged legs shook with fat, and Kim opened on him

with a shower of wayside chaff. Lurgan Sahib - this annoyed Kim - watched

the Babu and not the play.



<P>`I think,' said the Babu heavily, lighting a cigarette, `I am of opeenion

that it is most extraordinary and effeecient performance. Except that you

had told me I should have opined that - that - that you were pulling my

legs. How soon can he become approximately effeecient chain-man? Because

<I>then</I> I shall indent for him.'



<P>`That is what he must learn at Lucknow.'



<P>`Then order him to be jolly-dam'quick. Good-night, Lurgan.' The Babu

swung out with the gait of a bogged cow.



<P>When they were telling over the day's list of visitors, Lurgan Sahib

asked Kim who he thought the man might be.



<P>`God knows!' said Kim cheerily. The tone might almost have deceived

Mahbub Ali, but it failed entirely with the healer of sick pearls.



<P>`That is true. God, He knows; but I wish to know what you think.'



<P>Kim glanced sideways at his companion, whose eye had a way of compelling

truth.



<P>`I - I think he will want me when I come from the school, but' - confidentially,

as Lurgan Sahib nodded approval `I do not understand how <I>he</I> can

wear many dresses and talk many tongues.'



<P>`Thou wilt understand many things later. He is a writer of tales for

a certain Colonel. His honour is great only in Simla, and it is noticeable

that he has no name, but only a number and a letter - that is a custom

among us.'



<P>`And is there a price upon his head too - as upon Mah - all the others?'



<P>`Not yet; but if a boy rose up who is now sitting here and went - look,

the door is open! - as far as a certain house with a red-painted veranda,

behind that which was the old theatre in the Lower Bazar, and whispered

through the shutters: `Hurree Chunder Mookerjee bore the bad news of last

month', that boy might take away a belt full of rupees.'



<P>`How many?' said Kim promptly.



<P>`Five hundred - a thousand - as many as he might ask for.'



<P>`Good. And for how long might such a boy live after the news was told?'

He smiled merrily at Lurgan's Sahib's very beard.



<P>`Ah! That is to be well thought of. Perhaps if he were very clever,

he might live out the day - but not the night. By no means the night.'



<P>`Then what is the Babu's pay if so much is put upon his head?'



<P>`Eighty - perhaps a hundred - perhaps a hundred and fifty rupees; but

the pay is the least part of the work. From time to time, God causes men

to be born - and thou art one of them - who have a lust to go abroad at

the risk of their lives and discover news - today it may be of far-off

things, tomorrow of some hidden mountain, and the next day of some near-by

men who have done a foolishness against the State. These souls are very

few; and of these few, not more than ten are of the best. Among these ten

I count the Babu, and that is curious. How great, therefore, and desirable

must be a business that brazens the heart of a Bengali!'



<P>`True. But the days go slowly for me. I am yet a boy, and it is only

within two months I learned to write Angrezi. Even now I cannot read it

well. And there are yet years and years and long years before I can be

even a chain-man.'



<P>`Have patience, Friend of all the World' - Kim started at the title.

`Would I had a few of the years that so irk thee. I have proved thee in

several small ways. This will not be forgotten when I make my report to

the Colonel Sahib.' Then, changing suddenly into English with a deep laugh:



<P>`By Jove! O'Hara, I think there is a great deal in you; but you must

not become proud and you must not talk. You must go back to Lucknow and

be a good little boy and mind your book, as the English say, and perhaps,

next holidays if you care, you can come back to me!' Kim's face fell. `Oh,

I mean <I>if</I> you like. I know where you want to go.'



<P>Four days later a seat was booked for Kim and his small trunk at the

rear of a Kalka tonga. His companion was the whale-like Babu, who, with

a fringed shawl wrapped round his head, and his fat openwork-stockinged

left leg tucked under him, shivered and grunted in the morning chill.



<P>`How comes it that this man is one of <I>us</I>?' thought Kim considering

the jelly back as they jolted down the road; and the reflection shrew him

into most pleasant day-dreams. Lurgan Sahib had given him five rupees -

a splendid sum - as well as the assurance of his protection if he worked.

Unlike Mahbub, Lurgan Sahib had spoken most explicitly of the reward that

would follow obedience, and Kim was content. If only, like the Babu, he

could enjoy the dignity of a letter and a number - and a price upon his

head! Some day he would be all that and more. Some day he might be almost

as great as Mahbub Ali! The housetops of his search should be half India;

he would follow Kings and Ministers, as in the old days he had followed

<I>vakils</I> and lawyers' touts across Lahore city for Mahbub Ali's sake.

Meantime, there was the present, and not at all unpleasant, fact of St

Xavier's immediately before him. There would be new boys to condescend

to, and there would be tales of holiday adventures to hear. Young Martin,

son of the tea-planter at Manipur, had boasted that he would go to war,

with a rifle, against the head-hunters. That might be, but it was certain

young Martin had not been blown half across the forecourt of a Patiala

palace by an explosion of fireworks; nor had he... Kim fell to telling

himself the story of his own adventures through the last three months.

He could paralyse St Xavier's - even the biggest boys who shaved - with

the recital, were that permitted. But it was, of course, out of the question.

There would be a price upon his head in good time, as Lurgan Sahib had

assured him; and if he talked foolishly now, not only would that price

never be set, but Colonel Creighton would cast him off - and he would be

left to the wrath of Lurgan Sahib and Mahbub Ali - for the short space

of life that would remain to him.



<P>`So I should lose Delhi for the sake of a fish,' was his proverbial

philosophy. It behoved him to forget his holidays (there would always remain

the fun of inventing imaginary adventures) and, as Lurgan Sahib had said,

to work.



<P>Of all the boys hurrying back to St Xavier's, from Sukkur in the sands

to Galle beneath the palms, none was so filled with virtue as Kimball O'Hara,

jiggeting down to Umballa behind Hurree Chunder Mookerjee, whose name on

the books of one section of the Ethnological Survey was R17.



<P>And if additional spur were needed, the Babu supplied it. After a huge

meal at Kalka, he spoke uninterruptedly. Was Kim going to school? Then

he, an MA of Calcutta University, would explain the advantages of education.

There were marks to be gained by due attention to Latin and Wordsworth's

<I>Excursion</I> (all this was Greek to Kim). French, too was vital, and

the best was to be picked up in Chandernagore a few miles from Calcutta.

Also a man might go far, as he himself had done, by strict attention to

plays called <I>Lear</I> and <I>Julius Caesar</I>, both much in demand

by examiners. <I>Lear</I> was not so full of historical allusions as <I>Julius

Caesar</I>; the book cost four annas, but could be bought second-hand in

Bow Bazar for two. Still more important than Wordsworth, or the eminent

authors, Burke and Hare, was the art and science of mensuration. A boy

who had passed his examination in these branches - for which, by the way,

there were no cram-books - could, by merely marching over a country with

a compass and a level and a straight eye, carry away a picture of that

country which might be sold for large sums in coined silver. But as it

was occasionally inexpedient to carry about measuring-chains a boy would

do well to know the precise length of his own foot-pace, so that when he

was deprived of what Hurree Chunder called <I>adventitious aids</I> he

might still tread his distances. To keep count of thousands of paces, Hurree

Chunder's experience had shown him nothing more valuable than a rosary

of eighty-one or a hundred and eight beads, for <I>it was divisible and

sub-divisible into many multiples and sub-multiples</I>. Through the volleying

drifts of English, Kim caught the general trend of the talk, and it interested

him very much. Here was a new craft that a man could tuck away in his head

and by the look of the large wide world unfolding itself before him, it

seemed that the more a man knew the better for him.



<P>Said the Babu when he had talked for an hour and a half `I hope some

day to enjoy your offeecial acquaintance. <I>Ad interim</I>, if I may be

pardoned that expression, I shall give you this betel-box, which is highly

valuable article and cost me two rupees only four years ago.' It was a

cheap, heart-shaped brass thing with three compartments for carrying the

eternal betelnut, lime and pan-leaf; but it was filled with little tabloid-bottles.

`That is reward of merit for your performance in character of that holy

man. You see, you are so young you think you will last for ever and not

take care of your body. It is great nuisance to go sick in the middle of

business. I am fond of drugs myself; and they are handy to cure poor people

too. These are good Departmental drugs - quinine and so on. I give it you

for souvenir. Now good-bye. I have urgent private business here by the

roadside.'



<P>He slipped out noiselessly as a cat, on the Umballa road, hailed a passing

cart and jingled away, while Kim, tongue-tied, twiddled the brass betel-box

in his hands.&nbsp;

<HR>The record of a boy's education interests few save his parents, and,

as you know, Kim was an orphan. It is written in the books of St Xavier's

in Partibus that a report of Kim's progress was forwarded at the end of

each term to Colonel Creighton and to Father Victor, from whose hands duly

came the money for his schooling. It is further recorded in the same books

that he showed a great aptitude for mathematical studies as well as map-making,

and carried away a prize (<I>The Life of Lord Lawrence</I>, tree-calf;

two vols., nine rupees, eight annas) for proficiency therein; and the same

term played in St Xavier's eleven against the Alighur Mohammedan College,

his age being fourteen years and ten months. He was also re-vaccinated

(from which we may assume that there had been another epidemic of smallpox

at Lucknow) about the same time. Pencil notes on the edge of an old muster-roll

record that he was punished several times for <I>conversing with improper

persons</I>, and it seems that he was once sentenced to heavy pains for

<I>absenting himself for a day in the company of a street beggar</I>. That

was when he got over the gate and pleaded with the lama through a whole

day down the banks of the Gumti to accompany him on the Road next holidays

- for one month - for a little week; and the lama set his face as a flint

against it, averring that the time had not yet come. Kim's business, said

the old man as they ate cakes together, was to get all the wisdom of the

Sahibs and then he would see. The Hand of Friendship must in some way have

averted the Whip of Calamity: for six weeks later Kim seems to have passed

an examination in elementary surveying <I>with great credit</I>, his age

being fifteen years and eight months. From this date the record is silent.

His name does not appear in the year's batch of those who entered for the

subordinate Survey of India, but against it stand the words <I>removed

on appointment</I>.



<P>Several times in those three years, cast up at the Temple of the Tirthankars

in Benares the lama, a little thinner and a shade yellower, if that were

possible, but gentle and untainted as ever. Sometimes it was from the South

that he came - from south of Tuticorin, whence the wonderful fire-boats

go to Ceylon where are priests who know Pali; sometimes it was from the

wet green West and the thousand cotton-factory chimneys that ring Bombay;

and once from the North, where he had doubled back eight hundred miles

to talk for a day with the Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House. He

would stride to his cell in the cool, cut marble - the priests of the Temple

were good to the old man, - wash off the dust of travel, make prayer, and

depart for Lucknow, well accustomed now to the way of the rail, in a third-class

carriage. Returning, it was noticeable, as his friend the Seeker pointed

out to the head-priest, that he ceased for a while to mourn the loss of

his River, or to draw wondrous pictures of the Wheel of Life, but preferred

to talk of the beauty and wisdom of a certain mysterious <I>chela</I> whom

no man of the Temple had ever seen. Yes, he had followed the traces of

the Blessed Feet throughout all India. (The Curator has still in his possession

a most marvellous account of his wanderings and meditations.) There remained

nothing more in life but to find the River of the Arrow. Yet it was shown

to him in dreams that it was a matter not to be undertaken with any hope

of success unless that seeker had with him the one <I>chela</I> appointed

to bring the event to a happy issue, and versed in great wisdom - such

wisdom as white-haired Keepers of Images possess. For example (here came

out the snuff-gourd, and the kindly Jain priests made haste to be silent):



<P>`Long and long ago, when Devadatta was King of Benares let all listen

to the <I>J&icirc;taka</I>! - an elephant was captured for a time by the

king's hunters and, ere he broke free, beringed with a grievous leg-iron.

This he strove to remove with hate and frenzy in his heart, and hurrying

up and down the forests, besought his brother-elephants to wrench it asunder.

One by one, with their strong trunks, they tried and failed. At the last

they gave it as their opinion that the ring was not to be broken by any

bestial power. And in a thicket, new-born, wet with moisture of birth,

lay a day-old calf of the herd whose mother had died. The fettered elephant,

forgetting his own agony, said: `If I do not help this suckling it will

perish under our feet.' So he stood above the young thing, making his legs

buttresses against the uneasily moving herd; and he begged milk of a virtuous

cow, and the calf throve, and the ringed elephant was the calf's guide

and defence. Now the days of an:elephant - let all listen to the <I>J&icirc;taka</I>!

- are thirty-five years to his full strength, and through thirty-five Rains

the ringed elephant befriended the younger, and all the while the fetter

ate into the flesh.



<P>`Then one day the young elephant saw the half-buried iron, and turning

to the elder said: `What is this?' `It is even my sorrow,' said he who

had befriended him. Then that other put out his trunk and in the twinkling

of an eyelash abolished the ring, saying: `The appointed time has come.'

So the virtuous elephant who had waited temperately and done kind acts

was relieved, at the appointed time, by the very calf whom he had turned

aside to cherish - let all listen to the <I>J&icirc;taka</I>! - for the

Elephant was Ananda, and the Calf that broke the ring was none other than

The Lord Himself... '



<P>Then he would shake his head benignly, and over the ever-clicking rosary

point out how free that elephant-calf was from the sin of pride. He was

as humble as a <I>chela</I> who, seeing his master sitting in the dust

outside the Gates of Learning, overleapt the gates (though they were locked)

and took his master to his heart in the presence of the proud-stomached

city. Rich would be the reward of such a master and such a <I>chela</I>

when the time came for them to seek freedom together!



<P>So did the lama speak, coming and going across India as softly as a

bat. A sharp-tongued old woman in a house among the fruit-trees behind

Saharunpore honoured him as the woman honoured the prophet, but his chamber

was by no means upon the wall. In an apartment of the forecourt overlooked

by cooing doves he would sit, while she laid aside her useless veil and

chattered of spirits and fiends of Kulu, of grandchildren unborn, and of

the free-tongued brat who had talked to her in the resting-place. Once,

too, he strayed alone from the Grand Trunk Road below Umballa to the very

village whose priest had tried to drug him; but the kind Heaven that guards

lamas sent him at twilight through the crops, absorbed and unsuspicious,

to the Rissaldar's door. Here was like to have been a grave misunderstanding,

for the old soldier asked him why the Friend of the Stars had gone that

way only six days before.



<P>`That may not be,' said the lama. `He has gone back to his own people.'



<P>`He sat in that corner telling a hundred merry tales five nights ago,'

his host insisted. `True, he vanished somewhat suddenly in the dawn after

foolish talk with my granddaughter. He grows apace, but he is the same

Friend of the Stars as brought me true word of the war. Have ye parted?'



<P>`Yes - and no,' the lama replied. `We - we have not altogether parted,

but the time is not ripe that we should take the Road together. He acquires

wisdom in another place. We must wait.'



<P>`All one - but if it were not the boy how did he come to speak so continually

of thee?'



<P>`And what said he?' asked the lama eagerly.



<P>`Sweet words - an hundred thousand - that thou art his father and mother

and such all. Pity that he does not take the Queen's service. He is fearless.'



<P>This news amazed the lama, who did not then know how religiously Kim

kept to the contract made with Mahbub Ali, and perforce ratified by Colonel

Creighton...



<P>`There is no holding the young pony from the game,' said the horse-dealer

when the Colonel pointed out that vagabonding over India in holiday time

was absurd. `If permission be refused to go and come as he chooses, he

will make light of the refusal. Then who is to catch him? Colonel Sahib,

only once in a thousand years is a horse born so well fitted for the game

as this our colt. And we need men.'

<P><I>The Prodigal Son.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

Once more the lazy, string-tied, shuffling procession got under way, and

she slept till they reached the next halting-stage. It was a very short

march, and time lacked an hour to sundown, so Kim cast about for means

of amusement.



<P>`But why not sit and rest?' said one of the escort. `Only the devils

and the English walk to and fro without reason.'



<P>`Never make friends with the Devil, a Monkey, or a Boy. No man knows

what they will do next,' said his fellow.



<P>Kim turned a scornful back - he did not want to hear the old story how

the Devil played with the boys and repented of it - and walked idly across

country.



<P>The lama strode after him. All that day, whenever they passed a stream,

he had turned aside to look at it, but in no case had he received any warning

that he had found his River. Insensibly, too, the comfort of speaking to

someone in a reasonable tongue, and of being properly considered and respected

as her spiritual adviser by a well-born woman, had weaned his thoughts

a little from the Search. And further, he was prepared to spend serene

years in his quest; having nothing of the white man's impatience, but a

great faith.



<P>`Where goest thou?' he called after Kim.



<P>`Nowhither - it was a small march, and all this' - Kim waved his hands

abroad - `is new to me.'



<P>`She is beyond question a wise and a discerning woman. But it is hard

to meditate when - '



<P>`All women are thus.' Kim spoke as might have Solomon.



<P>`Before the lamassery was a broad platform,' the lama muttered, looping

up the well-worn rosary, `of stone. On that I have left the marks of my

feet - pacing to and fro with these.'



<P>He clicked the beads, and began the `<I>Om mane pudme hum's</I> of his

devotion; grateful for the cool, the quiet, and the absence of dust.



<P>One thing after another drew Kim's idle eye across the plain. There

was no purpose in his wanderings, except that the build of the huts near

by seemed new, and he wished to investigate.



<P>They came out on a broad tract of grazing-ground, brown and purple in

the afternoon light, with a heavy clump of mangoes in the centre. It struck

Kim as curious that no shrine stood in so eligible a spot: the boy was

observing as any priest for these things. Far across the plain walked side

by side four men, made small by the distance. He looked intently under

his curved palms and caught the sheen of brass.



<P>`Soldiers. White soldiers!' said he. `Let us see.'



<P>`It is always soldiers when thou and I go out alone together. But I

have never seen the white soldiers.'



<P>`They do no harm except when they are drunk. Keep behind this tree.'



<P>They stepped behind the thick trunks in the cool dark of the mango-tope.

Two little figures halted; the other two came forward uncertainly. They

were the advance-party of a regiment on the march, sent out, as usual,

to mark the camp. They bore five-foot sticks with fluttering flags, and

called to each other as they spread over the flat earth.



<P>At last they entered the mango-grove, walking heavily.



<P>`It's here or hereabouts - officers' tents under the trees, I take it,

an' the rest of us can stay outside. Have they marked out for the baggage-wagons

behind?'



<P>They cried again to their comrades in the distance, and the rough answer

came back faint and mellowed.



<P>`Shove the flag in here, then,' said one.



<P>`What do they prepare?' said the lama, wonderstruck. `This is a great

and terrible world. What is the device on the flag?'



<P>A soldier thrust a stave within a few feet of them, grunted discontentedly,

pulled it up again, conferred with his companion, who looked up and down

the shaded cave of greenery, and returned it.



<P>Kim stared with all his eyes, his breath coming short and sharp between

his teeth. The soldiers stamped off into the sunshine.



<P>`O Holy One!' he gasped. `My horoscope! The drawing in the dust by the

priest at Umballa! Remember what he said. First come two - <I>ferashes</I>

- to make all things ready - in a dark place, as it is always at the beginning

of a vision.'



<P>`But this is not vision,' said the lama. `It is the world's Illusion,

and no more.'



<P>`And after them comes the Bull - the Red Bull on the green field. Look!

It is he!'



<P>He pointed to the flag that was snap-snapping in the evening breeze

not ten feet away. It was no more than an ordinary camp marking-flag; but

the regiment, always punctilious in matters of millinery, had charged it

with the regimental device, the Red Bull, which is the crest of the Mavericks

- the great Red Bull on a background of Irish green.



<P>`I see, and now I remember,' said the lama. `Certainly it is thy Bull.

Certainly, also, the two men came to make all ready.'



<P>`They are soldiers - white soldiers. What said the priest? `The sign

over against the Bull is the sign of War and armed men.' Holy One, this

thing touches my Search.'



<P>`True. It is true.' The lama stared fixedly at the device that flamed

like a ruby in the dusk. `The priest at Umballa said that thine was the

sign of War.'



<P>`What is to do now?'



<P>`Wait. Let us wait.'



<P>`Even now the darkness clears,' said Kim. It was only natural that the

descending sun should at last strike through the tree-trunks, across the

grove, filling it with mealy gold light for a few minutes; but to Kim it

was the crown of the Umballa Brahmin's prophecy.



<P>`Hark!' said the lama. `One beats a drum - far off!'



<P>At first the sound, carrying diluted through the still air, resembled

the beating of an artery in the head. Soon a sharpness was added.



<P>`Ah! The music,' Kim explained. He knew the sound of a regimental band,

but it amazed the lama.



<P>At the far end of the plain a heavy, dusty column crawled in sight.

Then the wind brought the tune:

<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>We crave your condescension

<BR>To tell you what we know

<BR>Of marching in the Mulligan Guards

<BR>To Sligo Port below!



<P>Here broke in the shrill-tongued fifes:



<P>We shouldered arms,

<BR>We marched - we marched away.

<BR>From Phoenix Park

<BR>We marched to Dublin Bay.

<BR>The drums and the fifes,

<BR>Oh, sweetly they did play,

<BR>As we marched - marched - marched - with the

<BR>Mulligan Guards!</BLOCKQUOTE>

It was the band of the Mavericks playing the regiment to camp; for the

men were route-marching with their baggage. The rippling column swung into

the level - carts behind it - divided left and right, ran about like an

ant-hill, and...



<P>`But this is sorcery!' said the lama.



<P>The plain dotted itself with tents that seemed to rise, all spread,

from the carts. Another rush of men invaded the grove, pitched a huge tent

in silence, ran up yet eight or nine more by the side of it, unearthed

cooking-pots, pans, and bundles, which were taken possession of by a crowd

of native servants; and behold the mango-tope turned into an orderly town

as they watched!



<P>`Let us go,' said the lama, sinking back afraid, as the fires twinkled

and white officers with jingling swords stalked into the Mess-tent.



<P>`Stand back in the shadow. No one can see beyond the light of a fire,'

said Kim, his eyes still on the flag. He had never before watched the routine

of a seasoned regiment pitching camp in thirty minutes.



<P>`Look! look! look!' clucked the lama. `Yonder comes a priest.' It was

Bennett, the Church of England Chaplain of the regiment, limping in dusty

black. One of his flock had made some rude remarks about the Chaplain's

mettle; and to abash him Bennett had marched step by step with the men

that day. The black dress, gold cross on the watch-chain, the hairless

face, and the soft, black wide-awake hat would have marked him as a holy

man anywhere in all India. He dropped into a camp-chair by the door of

the Mess-tent and slid off his boots. Three or four officers gathered round

him, laughing and joking over his exploit.



<P>`The talk of white men is wholly lacking in dignity,' said the lama,

who judged only by tone. `But I considered the countenance of that priest

and I think he is learned. Is it likely that he will understand our talk?

I would talk to him of my Search.'



<P>`Never speak to a white man till he is fed,' said Kim, quoting a well-known

proverb. `They will eat now, and - and I do not think they are good to

beg from. Let us go back to the resting-place. After we have eaten we will

come again. It certainly was a Red Bull - <I>my</I> Red Bull.'



<P>They were both noticeably absent-minded when the old lady's retinue

set their meal before them; so none broke their reserve, for it is not

lucky to annoy guests.



<P>`Now,' said Kim, picking his teeth, `we will return to that place; but

thou, O Holy One, must wait a little way off, because thy feet are heavier

than mine and I am anxious to see more of that Red Bull.'



<P>`But how canst thou understand the talk? Walk slowly. The road is dark,'

the lama replied uneasily.



<P>Kim put the question aside. `I marked a place near to the trees,' said

he, `where thou canst sit till I call. Nay,' as the lama made some sort

of protest, `remember this is <I>my</I> Search - the Search for my Red

Bull. The sign in the Stars was not for thee. I know a little of the customs

of white soldiers, and I always desire to see some new things.'



<P>`What dost thou not know of this world?' The lama squatted obediently

in a little hollow of the ground not a hundred yards from the hump of the

mango-trees dark against the star-powdered sky.



<P>`Stay till I call.' Kim flitted into the dusk. He knew that in all probability

there would be sentries round the camp, and smiled to himself as he heard

the thick boots of one. A boy who can dodge over the roofs of Lahore city

on a moonlight night, using every little patch and corner of darkness to

discomfit his pursuer, is not likely to be checked by a line of well-trained

soldiers. He paid them the compliment of crawling between a couple, and,

running and halting, crouching and dropping flat, worked his way toward

the lighted Mess-tent where, close pressed behind the mango-tree, he waited

till some chance word should give him a returnable lead.



<P>The one thing now in his mind was further information as to the Red

Bull. For aught he knew, and Kim's limitations were as curious and sudden

as his expansions, the men, the nine hundred thorough devils of his father's

prophecy, might pray to the beast after dark, as Hindus pray to the Holy

Cow. That at least would be entirely right and logical, and the padre with

the gold cross would be therefore the man to consult in the matter. On

the other hand, remembering sober-faced padres whom he had avoided in Lahore

city, the priest might be an inquisitive nuisance who would bid him learn.

But had it not been proven at Umballa that his sign in the high heavens

portended War and armed men? Was he not the Friend of the Stars as well

as of all the World, crammed to the teeth with dreadful secrets? Lastly

- and firstly as the undercurrent of all his quick thoughts - this adventure,

though he did not know the English word, was a stupendous lark - a delightful

continuation of his old flights across the housetops, as well as the fulfilment

of sublime prophecy. He lay belly-flat and wriggled towards the Mess-tent

door, a hand on the amulet round his neck.



<P>It was as he suspected. The Sahibs prayed to their God; for in the centre

of the Mess-table - its sole ornament when they were on the line of march

- stood a golden bull fashioned from old-time loot of the Summer Palace

at Pekin - a red-gold bull with lowered head, ramping upon a field of Irish

green. To him the Sahibs held out their glasses and cried aloud confusedly.



<P>Now the Reverend Arthur Bennett always left Mess after that toast, and

being rather tired by his march his movements were more abrupt than usual.

Kim, with slightly raised head, was still staring at his totem on the table,

when the Chaplain stepped on his right shoulder-blade. Kim flinched under

the leather, and, rolling sideways, brought down the Chaplain, who, ever

a man of action, caught him by the throat and nearly choked the life out

of him. Kim then kicked him desperately in the stomach. Mr Bennett gasped

and doubled up, but without relaxing his grip, rolled over again, and silently

hauled Kim to his own tent. The Mavericks were incurable practical jokers;

and it occurred to the Englishman that silence was best till he had made

complete inquiry.



<P>`Why, it's a boy!' he said, as he drew his prize under the light of

the tent-pole lantern, then shaking him severely cried: `What were you

doing? You're a thief. <I>Choor</I>? <I>Mallum</I>?' His Hindustani was

very limited, and the ruffled and disgusted Kim intended to keep to the

character laid down for him. As he recovered his breath he was inventing

a beautifully plausible tale of his relations to some scullion, and at

the same time keeping a keen eye on and a little under the Chaplain's left

arm-pit. The chance came; he ducked for the doorway, but a long arm shot

out and clutched at his neck, snapping the amulet-string and closing on

the amulet.



<P>`Give it me. O, give it me. Is it lost? Give me the papers.'



<P>The words were in English - the tinny, saw-cut English of the native-bred,

and the Chaplain jumped.



<P>`A scapular,' said he, opening his hand. `No, some sort of heathen charm.

Why - why, do you speak English? Little boys who steal are beaten. You

know that?'



<P>`I do not - I did not steal.' Kim danced in agony like a terrier at

a lifted stick. `Oh, give it me. It is my charm. Do not thieve it from

me.'



<P>The Chaplain took no heed, but, going to the tent door, called aloud.

A fattish, clean-shaven man appeared.



<P>`I want your advice, Father Victor,' said Bennett. `I found this boy

in the dark outside the Mess-tent. Ordinarily, I should have chastised

him and let him go, because I believe him to be a thief. But it seems he

talks English, and he attaches some sort of value to a charm round his

neck. I thought perhaps you might help me.'



<P>Between himself and the Roman Catholic Chaplain of the Irish contingent

lay, as Bennett believed, an unbridgeable gulf, but it was noticeable that

whenever the Church of England dealt with a human problem she was very

likely to call in the Church of Rome. Bennett's official abhorrence of

the Scarlet Woman and all her ways was only equalled by his private respect

for Father Victor.



<P>`A thief talking English, is it? Let's look at his charm. No, it's not

a scapular, Bennett.' He held out his hand.



<P>`But have we any right to open it? A sound whipping - '



<P>`I did <I>not</I> thieve,' protested Kim. `You have hit me kicks all

over my body. Now give me my charm and I will go away.'



<P>`Not quite so fast. We'll look first,' said Father Victor, leisurely

rolling out poor Kimball O'Hara's <I>ne varietur</I> parchment, his clearance-certificate,

and Kim's baptismal certificate. On this last O'Hara - with some confused

idea that he was doing wonders for his son - had scrawled scores of times:

`

<BLOCKQUOTE>Look after the boy. Please look after the boy</BLOCKQUOTE>

' - signing his name and regimental number in full.



<P>`Powers of Darkness below!' said Father Victor, passing all over to

Mr Bennett. `Do you know what these things are?'



<P>`Yes,' said Kim. `They are mine, and I want to go away.'



<P>`I do not quite understand,' said Mr Bennett. `He probably brought them

on purpose. It may be a begging trick of some kind.'



<P>`I never saw a beggar less anxious to stay with his company, then. There's

the makings of a gay mystery here. Ye believe in Providence, Bennett?'



<P>`I hope so.'



<P>`Well, I believe in miracles, so it comes to the same thing. Powers

of Darkness! Kimball O'Hara! And his son! But then he's a native, and I

saw Kimball married myself to Annie Shott. How long have you had these

things, boy?'



<P>`Ever since I was a little baby.'



<P>Father Victor stepped forward quickly and opened the front of Kim's

upper garment. `You see, Bennett, he's not very black. What's your name?'



<P>`Kim.'



<P>`Or Kimball?'



<P>`Perhaps. Will you let me go away?'



<P>`What else?'



<P>`They call me Kim Rishti ke. That is Kim of the Rishti.'



<P>`What is that - `Rishti'?'



<P>`<I>Eye</I>-rishti - that was the Regiment - my father's.'



<P>`Irish - oh, I see.'



<P>`Yess. That was how my father told me. My father, he has lived.'



<P>`Has lived where?'



<P>`Has lived. Of <I>course</I> he is dead - gone-out.'



<P>`Oh! That's your abrupt way of putting it, is it?'



<P>Bennett interrupted. `It is possible I have done the boy an injustice.

He is certainly white, though evidently neglected. I am sure I must have

bruised him. I do not think spirits - '



<P>`Get him a glass of sherry, then, and let him squat on the cot. Now,

Kim,' continued Father Victor, `no one is going to hurt you. Drink that

down and tell us about yourself. The truth, if you've no objection.'



<P>Kim coughed a little as he put down the empty glass, and considered.

This seemed a time for caution and fancy. Small boys who prowl about camps

are generally turned out after a whipping. But he had received no stripes;

the amulet was evidently working in his favour, and it looked as though

the Umballa horoscope and the few words that he could remember of his father's

maunderings fitted in most miraculously. Else why did the fat padre seem

so impressed, and why the glass of hot yellow drink from the lean one?



<P>`My father, he is dead in Lahore city since I was very little. The woman,

she kept <I>kabarri</I> shop near where the hire carriages are.' Kim began

with a plunge, not quite sure how far the truth would serve him.



<P>`Your mother?'



<P>`<I>No</I>!' - with a gesture of disgust. `She went out when I was born.

My father, he got these papers from the Jadoo-Gher - what do you call that?'

(Bennett nodded) `because he was in - good-standing. What do you call that?'

(again Bennett nodded). `My father told me that. He said, too, and also

the Brahmin who made the drawing in the dust at Umballa two days ago, <I>he</I>

said, that I shall find a Red Bull on a green field and that the Bull shall

help me.'



<P>`A phenomenal little liar,' muttered Bennett.



<P>`Powers of Darkness below, what a country!' murmured Father Victor.

`Go on, Kim.'



<P>`I did <I>not</I> thieve. Besides, I am just now disciple of a very

holy man. He is sitting outside. We saw two men come with flags, making

the place ready. That is <I>always</I> so in a dream, or on account of

a - a - prophecy. So I knew it was come true. I saw the Red Bull on the

green field, and my father he said: `Nine hundred <I>pukka</I> devils and

the Colonel riding on a horse will look after you when you find the Red

Bull!' I did not know what to do when I saw the Bull, but I went away and

I came again when it was dark. I wanted to see the Bull again, and I saw

the Bull again with the - the Sahibs praying to it. I think the Bull shall

help me. The holy man said so too. He is sitting outside. Will you hurt

him, if I call him a shout now? He is very holy. He can witness to all

the things I say, and he knows I am not a thief.'



<P>``Sahibs praying to a bull!' What in the world do you make of that?'

said Bennett. ``Disciple of a holy man!' Is the boy mad?'



<P>`It's O'Hara's boy, sure enough. O'Hara's boy leagued with all the Powers

of Darkness. It's very much what his father would have done - if he was

drunk. We'd better invite the holy man. He may know something.'



<P>`He does not know anything,' said Kim. `I will show you him if you come.

He is my master. Then afterwards we can go.'



<P>`Powers of Darkness!' was all that Father Victor could say, as Bennett

marched off, with a firm hand on Kim's shoulder.



<P>They found the lama where he had dropped.



<P>`The Search is at an end for me,' shouted Kim in the vernacular. `I

have found the Bull, but God knows what comes next. They will not hurt

you. Come to the fat priest's tent with this thin man and see the end.

It is all new, and they cannot talk Hindi. They are only uncurried donkeys.'



<P>`Then it is not well to make a jest of their ignorance,' the lama returned.

`I am glad if thou art rejoiced, <I>chela</I>.'



<P>Dignified and unsuspicious, he strode into the little tent, saluted

the Churches as a Churchman, and sat down by the open charcoal brazier.

The yellow lining of the tent reflected in the lamplight made his face

red-gold.



<P>Bennett looked at him with the triple-ringed uninterest of the creed

that lumps nine-tenths of the world under the title of <I>heathen</I>.



<P>`And what was the end of the Search? What gift has the Red Bull brought?'

The lama addressed himself to Kim.



<P>`He says, `What are you going to do?'' Bennett was staring uneasily

at Father Victor, and Kim, for his own ends, took upon himself the office

of interpreter.



<P>`I do not see what concern this <I>fakir</I> has with the boy, who is

probably his dupe or his confederate,' Bennett began. `We cannot allow

an English boy - Assuming that he is the son of a Mason, the sooner he

goes to the Masonic Orphanage the better.'



<P>`Ah! That's your opinion as Secretary to the Regimental Lodge,' said

Father Victor; `but we might as well tell the old man what we are going

to do. He doesn't look like a villain.'



<P>`My experience is that one can never fathom the Oriental mind. Now,

Kimball, I wish you to tell this man what I say - word for word.'



<P>Kim gathered the import of the next few sentences and began thus:



<P>`Holy One, the thin fool who looks like a camel says that I am the son

of a Sahib.'



<P>`But how?'



<P>`Oh, it is true. I knew it since my birth, but <I>he</I> could only

find it out by rending the amulet from my neck and reading all the papers.

He thinks that once a Sahib is always a Sahib, and between the two of them

they purpose to keep me in this Regiment or to send me to a <I>madrissah</I>

[a school]. It has happened before. I have always avoided it. The fat fool

is of one mind and the camel-like one of another. But that is no odds.

I may spend one night here and perhaps the next. It has happened before.

Then I will run away and return to thee.'



<P>`But tell them that thou art my <I>chela</I>. Tell them how thou didst

come to me when I was faint and bewildered. Tell them of our Search, and

they will surely let thee go now.'



<P>`I have already told them. They laugh, and they talk of the police.'



<P>`What are you saying?' asked Mr Bennett.



<P>`Oah. He only says that if you do not let me go it will stop him in

his business - his ur-gent private af-fairs.' This last was a reminiscence

of some talk with a Eurasian clerk in the Canal Department, but it only

drew a smile, which nettled him. `And if you <I>did</I> know what his business

was you would not be in such a beastly hurry to interfere.'



<P>`What is it then?' said Father Victor, not without feeling, as he watched

the lama's face.



<P>`There is a River in this country which he wishes to find so verree

much. It was put out by an Arrow which - ' Kim tapped his foot impatiently

as he translated in his own mind from the vernacular to his clumsy English.

`Oah, it was made by our Lord God Buddha, you know, and if you wash there

you are washed away from all your sins and made as white as cotton-wool.'

(Kim had heard mission-talk in his time.) `I am his disciple, and we <I>must</I>

find that River. It is so verree valuable to us.'



<P>`Say that again,' said Bennett. Kim obeyed, with amplifications.



<P>`But this is gross blasphemy!' cried the Church of England.



<P>`Tck! Tck!' said Father Victor sympathetically. `I'd give a good deal

to be able to talk the vernacular. A river that washes away sin! And how

long have you two been looking for it?'



<P>`Oh, many days. Now we wish to go away and look for it again. It is

not here, you see.'



<P>`I see,' said Father Victor gravely. `But he can't go on in that old

man's company. It would be different, Kim, if you were not a soldier's

son. Tell him that the Regiment will take care of you and make you as good

a man as your - as good a man as can be. Tell him that if he believes in

miracles he must believe that - '



<P>`There is no need to play on his credulity,' Bennett interrupted.



<P>`I'm doing no such thing. He must believe that the boy's coming here

- to his own Regiment - in search of his Red Bull is in the nature of a

miracle. Consider the chances against it, Bennett. This one boy in all

India, and our Regiment of all others on the line o' march for him to meet

with! It's predestined on the face of it. Yes, tell him it's <I>Kismet</I>.

<I>Kismet</I>, <I>mallum</I>? [Do you understand?]'



<P>He turned towards the lama, to whom he might as well have talked of

Mesopotamia.



<P>`They say,' - the old man's eye lighted at Kim's speech - `they say

that the meaning of my horoscope is now accomplished, and that being led

back - though as thou knowest I went out of curiosity - to these people

and their Red Bull I must needs go to a <I>madrissah</I> and be turned

into a Sahib. Now I make pretence of agreement, for at the worst it will

be but a few meals eaten away from thee. Then I will slip away and follow

down the road to Saharunpore. Therefore, Holy One, keep with that Kulu

woman - on no account stray far from her cart till I come again. Past question,

my sign is of War and of armed men. See how they have given me wine to

drink and set me upon a bed of honour! My father must have been some great

person. So if they raise me to honour among them, good. If not, good again.

However it goes, I will run back to thee when I am tired. But stay with

the Rajputni, or I shall miss thy feet... Oah yess,' said the boy, `I have

told him everything you tell me to say.'



<P>`And I cannot see any need why he should wait,' said Bennett, feeling

in his trouser-pocket. `We can investigate the details later - and I will

give him a ru - '



<P>`Give him time. Maybe he's fond of the lad,' said Father Victor, half

arresting the clergyman's motion.



<P>The lama dragged forth his rosary and pulled his huge hat-brim over

his eyes.



<P>`What can he want now?'



<P>`He says' - Kim put up one hand. `He says: Be quiett. He wants to speak

to me by himself. You see, you do not know one little word of what he says,

and I think if you talk he will perhaps give you very bad curses. When

he takes those beads like that, you see, he always wants to be quiett.'



<P>The two Englishmen sat overwhelmed, but there was a look in Bennett's

eye that promised ill for Kim when he should be relaxed to the religious

arm.



<P>`A Sahib and the son of a Sahib - ' The lama's voice was harsh with

pain. `But no white man knows the land and the customs of the land as thou

knowest. How comes it this is true?'



<P>`What matter, Holy One? - but remember it is only for a night or two.

Remember, I can change swiftly. It will all be as it was when I first spoke

to thee under Zam-Zammah the great gun - '



<P>`As a boy in the dress of white men - when I first went to the Wonder

House. And a second time thou wast a Hindu. What shall the third incarnation

be?' He chuckled drearily. `Ah, <I>chela</I>, thou has done a wrong to

an old man because my heart went out to thee.'



<P>`And mine to thee. But how could I know that the Red Bull would bring

me to this business?'



<P>The lama covered his face afresh, and nervously rattled the rosary.

Kim squatted beside him and laid hold upon a fold of his clothing.



<P>`Now it is understood that the boy is a Sahib?' he went on in a muffled

tone. `Such a Sahib as was he who kept the images in the Wonder House.'

The lama's experience of white men was limited. He seemed to be repeating

a lesson. `So then it is not seemly that he should do other than as the

Sahibs do. He must go back to his own people.'



<P>`For a day and a night and a day,' Kim pleaded.



<P>`No, ye don't!' Father Victor saw Kim edging towards the door, and interposed

a strong leg.



<P>`I do not understand the customs of white men. The Priest of the Images

in the Wonder House in Lahore was more courteous than the thin one here.

This boy will be taken from me. They will make a Sahib of my disciple?

Woe to me! How shall I find my River? Have <I>they</I> no disciples? Ask.'



<P>`He says he is very sorree that he cannot find the River now any more.

He says, Why have you no disciples, and stop bothering him? He wants to

be washed of his sins.'



<P>Neither Bennett nor Father Victor found any answer ready.



<P>Said Kim in English, distressed for the lama's agony: `I think if you

will let me go now we will walk away quietly and not steal. We will look

for that River like before I was caught. I wish I did not come here to

find the Red Bull and all that sort of thing. I do not want it.'



<P>`It's the very best day's work you ever did for yourself, young man,'

said Bennett.



<P>`Good heavens, I don't know how to console him,' said Father Victor,

watching the lama intently. `He can't take the boy away with him, and yet

he's a good man - I'm sure he's a good man. Bennett, if you give him that

rupee he'll curse you root and branch!'



<P>They listened to each other's breathing - three - five full minutes.

Then the lama raised his head, and looked forth across them into space

and emptiness.



<P>`And I am a Follower of the Way,' he said bitterly. `The sin is mine

and the punishment is mine. I made believe to myself - for now I see it

was but make-belief - that thou wast sent to me to aid in the Search. So

my heart went out to thee for thy charity and thy courtesy and the wisdom

of thy little years. But those who follow the Way must permit not the fire

of any desire or attachment, for that is all Illusion. As says... ` He

quoted an old, old Chinese text, backed it with another, and reinforced

these with a third. `I stepped aside from the Way, my <I>chela</I>. It

was no fault of thine. I delighted in the sight of life, the new people

upon the roads, and in thy joy at seeing these things. I was pleased with

thee who should have considered my Search and my Search alone. Now I am

sorrowful because thou art taken away and my River is far from me. It is

the Law which I have broken!'



<P>`Powers of Darkness below!' said Father Victor, who, wise in the confessional,

heard the pain in every sentence.



<P>`I see now that the sign of the Red Bull was a sign for me as well as

for thee. All Desire is red - and evil. I will do penance and find my River

alone.'



<P>`At least go back to the Kulu woman,' said Kim, `otherwise thou wilt

be lost upon the roads. She will feed thee till I run back to thee.'



<P>The lama waved a hand to show that the matter was finally settled in

his mind.



<P>`Now,' - his tone altered as he turned to Kim, - `what will they do

with thee? At least I may, acquiring merit, wipe out past ill.'



<P>`Make me a Sahib - so they think. The day after tomorrow I return. Do

not grieve.'



<P>`Of what sort? Such an one as this or that man?' He pointed to Father

Victor. `Such an one as those I saw this evening - men wearing swords and

stamping heavily?'



<P>`Maybe.'



<P>`That is not well. These men follow desire and come to emptiness. Thou

must not be of their sort.'



<P>`The Umballa priest said that my Star was War,' Kim interjected. `I

will ask these fools - but there is truly no need. I will run away this

night, for all I wanted to see the new things.'



<P>Kim put two or three questions in English to Father Victor, translating

the replies to the lama.



<P>Then: `He says, `You take him from me and you cannot say what you will

make him.' He says, `Tell me before I go, for it is not a small thing to

make a child.''



<P>`You will be sent to a school. Later on, we shall see. Kimball, I suppose

you'd like to be a soldier?'



<P>`<I>Gorah-log</I> [white-folk]. No-ah! No-ah!' Kim shook his head violently.

There was nothing in his composition to which drill and routine appealed.

`I will <I>not</I> be a soldier.'



<P>`You will be what you're told to be,' said Bennett; `and you should

be grateful that we're going to help you.'



<P>Kim smiled compassionately. If these men lay under the delusion that

he would do anything that he did not fancy, so much the better.



<P>Another long silence followed. Bennett fidgeted with impatience, and

suggested calling a sentry to evict the <I>fakir</I>.



<P>`Do they give or sell learning among the Sahibs? Ask them,' said the

lama, and Kim interpreted.



<P>`They say that money is paid to the teacher - but that money the Regiment

will give... What need? It is only for a night.'



<P>`And - the more money is paid the better learning is given?' The lama

disregarded Kim's plans for an early flight. `It is no wrong to pay for

learning. To help the ignorant to wisdom is always a merit.' The rosary

clicked furiously as an abacus. Then he faced his oppressors.



<P>`Ask them for how much money do they give a wise and suitable teaching?

And in what city is that teaching given?'



<P>`Well,' said Father Victor in English, when Kim had translated, `that

depends. The Regiment would pay for you all the time you are at the Military

Orphanage; or you might go on the Punjab Masonic Orphanage's list (not

that he or you 'ud understand what that means); but the best schooling

a boy can get in India is, of course, at St Xavier's in Partibus at Lucknow.'

This took some time to interpret, for Bennett wished to cut it short.



<P>`He wants to know how much?' said Kim placidly.



<P>`Two or three hundred rupees a year.' Father Victor was long past any

sense of amazement. Bennett, impatient, did not understand.



<P>`He says: `Write that name and the money upon a paper and give it him.'

And he says you must write your name below, because he is going to write

a letter in some days to you. He says you are a good man. He says the other

man is a fool. He is going away.'



<P>The lama rose suddenly. `I follow my Search,' he cried, and was gone.



<P>`He'll run slap into the sentries,' cried Father Victor, jumping up

as the lama stalked out; `but I can't leave the boy.' Kim made swift motion

to follow, but checked himself. There was no sound of challenge outside.

The lama had disappeared.



<P>Kim settled himself composedly on the Chaplain's cot. At least the lama

had promised that he would stay with the Rajput woman from Kulu, and the

rest was of the smallest importance. It pleased him that the two padres

were so evidently excited. They talked long in undertones, Father Victor

urging some scheme on Mr Bennett, who seemed incredulous. All this was

very new and fascinating, but Kim felt sleepy. They called men into the

tent - one of them certainly was the Colonel, as his father had prophesied

- and they asked him an infinity of questions, chiefly about the woman

who looked after him, all of which Kim answered truthfully. They did not

seem to think the woman a good guardian.



<P>After all, this was the newest of his experiences. Sooner or later,

if he chose, he could escape into great, grey, formless India, beyond tents

and padres and colonels. Meantime, if the Sahibs were to be impressed,

he would do his best to impress them. He too was a white man.



<P>After much talk that he could not comprehend, they handed him over to

a sergeant, who had strict instructions not to let him escape. The Regiment

would go on to Umballa, and Kim would be sent up, partly at the expense

of the Lodge and in part by subscription, to a place called Sanawar.



<P>`It's miraculous past all whooping, Colonel,' said Father Victor, when

he had talked without a break for ten minutes. `His Buddhist friend has

levanted after taking my name and address. I can't quite make out whether

he'll pay for the boy's education or whether he is preparing some sort

of witchcraft on his own account.' Then to Kim: `You'll live to be grateful

to your friend the Red Bull yet. We'll make a man of you at Sanawar - even

at the price o' making you a Protestant.'



<P>`Certainly - most certainly,' said Bennett.



<P>`But you will not go to Sanawar,' said Kim.



<P>`But we <I>will</I> go to Sanawar, little man. That's the order of the

Commander-in-Chief, who's a trifle more important than O'Hara's son.'



<P>`You will not go to Sanawar. You will go to thee War.'



<P>There was a shout of laughter from the full tent.



<P>`When you know your own Regiment a trifle better you won't confuse the

line of march with line of battle, Kim. We hope to go to `thee War' sometime.'



<P>`Oah, I know all thatt.' Kim drew his bow again at a venture. If they

were not going to the war, at least they did not know what he knew of the

talk in the veranda at Umballa.



<P>`I know you are not at thee war now; but I tell <I>you</I> that as soon

as you get to Umballa you will be sent to the war - the new war. It is

a war of eight thousand men, besides the guns.'



<P>`That's explicit. D'you add prophecy to your other gifts? Take him along,

sergeant. Take up a suit for him from the Drums, an' take care he doesn't

slip through your fingers. Who says the age of miracles is gone by? I think

I'll go to bed. My poor mind's weakening.'



<P>At the far end of the camp, silent as a wild animal, an hour later sat

Kim, newly washed all over, in a horrible stuff suit that rasped his arms

and legs.



<P>`A most amazin' young bird,' said the sergeant. `He turns up in charge

of a yellow-headed buck-Brahmin priest, with his father's Lodge certificates

round his neck, talkin' God knows what all of a red bull. The buck-Brahmin

evaporates without explanations, an' the bhoy sets cross-legged on the

Chaplain's bed prophesyin' bloody war to the men at large. Injia's a wild

land for a God-fearin' man. I'll just tie his leg to the tent-pole in case

he'll go through the roof. What did ye say about the war?'



<P>`Eight thousand men, besides guns,' said Kim. `Very soon you will see.'



<P>`You're a consolin' little imp. Lie down between the Drums an' go to

bye-bye. Those two boys will watch your slumbers.'

Then, lowering their voices, they spoke together. Kim came to rest under

a tree, but the lama tugged impatiently at his elbow.



<P>`Let us go on. The River is not here.'



<P>`<I>Hai mai!</I> Have we not walked enough for a little? Our River will

not run away. Patience, and he will give us a dole.'



<P>`This,' said the old soldier suddenly, `is the Friend of the Stars.

He brought me the news yesterday. Having seen the very man Himself, in

a vision, giving orders for the war.'



<P>`Hm!' said his son, all deep in his broad chest. `He came by a bazar-rumour

and made profit of it.'



<P>His father laughed. `At least he did not ride to me begging for a new

charger, and the Gods know how many rupees. Are thy brothers' regiments

also under orders?'



<P>`I do not know. I took leave and came swiftly to thee in case--'



<P>`In case they ran before thee to beg. O gamblers and spendthrifts all!

But thou hast never yet ridden in a charge. A good horse is needed there,

truly. A good follower and a good pony also for the marching. Let us see

- let us see.' He thrummed on the pommel.



<P>`This is no place to cast accounts in, my father. Let us go to thy house.'



<P>`At least pay the boy, then: I have no pice with me, and he brought

auspicious news. Ho! Friend of all the World, a war is toward as thou hast

said.'



<P>`Nay, as I know, <I>the</I> war,' returned Kim composedly.



<P>`Eh?' said the lama, fingering his beads, all eager for the road.



<P>`My master does not trouble the Stars for hire. We brought the news

- bear witness, we brought the news, and now we go.' Kim half-crooked his

hand at his side.



<P>The son tossed a silver coin through the sunlight, grumbling something

about beggars and jugglers. It was a four-anna piece, and would feed them

well for days. The lama, seeing the flash of the metal, droned a blessing.



<P>`Go thy way, Friend of all the World,' piped the old soldier, wheeling

his scrawny mount. `For once in all my days I have met a true prophet -

who was not in the Army.'



<P>Father and son swung round together: the old man sitting as erect as

the younger.



<P>A Punjabi constable in yellow linen trousers slouched across the road.

He had seen the money pass.



<P>`Halt!' he cried in impressive English. `Know ye not that there is a

<I>takkus</I> of two annas a head, which is four annas, on those who enter

the Road from this side-road? It is the order of the Sirkar, and the money

is spent for the planting of trees and the beautification of the ways.'



<P>`And the bellies of the police,' said Kim, slipping out of arm's reach.

`Consider for a while, man with a mud head. Think you we came from the

nearest pond like the frog, thy father-in-law? Hast thou ever heard the

name of thy brother?'



<P>`And who was he? Leave the boy alone,' cried a senior constable, immensely

delighted, as he squatted down to smoke his pipe in the veranda.



<P>`He took a label from a bottle of <I>belaitee-pani</I> [soda-water],

and, affixing it to a bridge, collected taxes for a month from those who

passed, saying that it was the Sirkar's order. Then came an Englishman

and broke his head. Ah, brother, I am a town-crow, not a village-crow!'



<P>The policeman drew back abashed, and Kim hooted at him all down the

road.



<P>`Was there ever such a disciple as I?' he cried merrily to the lama.

`All earth would have picked thy bones within ten mile of Lahore city if

I had not guarded thee.'



<P>`I consider in my own mind whether thou art a spirit, sometimes, or

sometimes an evil imp,' said the lama, smiling slowly.



<P>`I am thy <I>chela</I>.' Kim dropped into step at his side - that indescribable

gait of the long-distance tramp all the world over.



<P>`Now let us walk,' muttered the lama, and to the click of his rosary

they walked in silence mile upon mile. The lama as usual, was deep in meditation,

but Kim's bright eyes were open wide. This broad, smiling river of life,

he considered, was a vast improvement on the cramped and crowded Lahore

streets. There were new people and new sights at every stride - castes

he knew and castes that were altogether out of his experience.



<P>They met a troop of long-haired, strong-scented Sansis with baskets

of lizards and other unclean food on their backs, their lean dogs sniffing

at their heels. These people kept their own side of the road, moving at

a quick, furtive jog-trot, and all other castes gave them ample room; for

the Sansi is deep pollution. Behind them, walking wide and stiffly across

the strong shadows, the memory of his leg-irons still on him, strode one

newly released from the jail; his full stomach and shiny skin to prove

that the Government fed its prisoners better than most honest men could

feed themselves. Kim knew that walk well, and made broad jest of it as

they passed. Then an Akali, a wild-eyed, wild-haired Sikh devotee in the

blue-checked clothes of his faith, with polished-steel quoits glistening

on the cone of his tall blue turban, stalked past, returning from a visit

to one of the independent Sikh States, where he had been singing the ancient

glories of the Khalsa to College-trained princelings in top-boots and white-cord

breeches. Kim was careful not to irritate that man; for the Akali's temper

is short and his arm quick. Here and there they met or were overtaken by

the gaily dressed crowds of whole villages turning out to some local fair;

the women, with their babes on their hips, walking behind the men, the

older boys prancing on sticks of sugar-cane, dragging rude brass models

of locomotives such as they sell for a half penny, or flashing the sun

into the eyes of their betters from cheap toy mirrors. One could see at

a glance what each had bought; and if there were any doubt it needed only

to watch the the wives comparing, brown arm against brown arm, the newly

purchased dull glass bracelets that come from the North-West. These merry-makers

stepped slowly, calling one to the other and stopping to haggle with sweetmeat-sellers,

or to make a prayer before one of the wayside shrines - sometimes Hindu,

sometimes Mussalman - which the low-caste of both creeds share with beautiful

impartiality. A solid line of blue, rising and falling like the back of

a caterpillar in haste, would swing up through the quivering dust and trot

past to a chorus of quick cackling. That was a gang of <I>changars</I>

- the women who have taken all the embankments of all the Northern railways

under their charge - a flat-footed, big-bosomed, strong-limbed, blue-petticoated

clan of earth-carriers, hurrying north on news of a job, and wasting no

time by the road. They belong to the caste whose men do not count, and

they walked with squared elbows, swinging hips, and heads on high, as suits

women who carry heavy weights. A little later a marriage procession would

strike into the Grand Trunk with music and shoutings, and a smell of marigold

and jasmine stronger even than the reek of the dust. One could see the

bride's litter, a blur of red and tinsel, staggering through the haze,

while the bridegroom's bewreathed pony turned aside to snatch a mouthful

from a passing fodder-cart. Then Kim would join the Kentish-fire of good

wishes and bad jokes, wishing the couple a hundred sons and no daughters,

as the saying is. Still more interesting and more to be shouted over it

was when a strolling juggler with some half-trained monkeys, or a panting,

feeble bear, or a woman who tied goats' horns to her feet, and with these

danced on a slack-rope, set the horses to shying and the women to shrill,

long-drawn quavers of amazement.



<P>The lama never raised his eyes. He did not note the money lender on

his goose-rumped pony, hastening along to collect the cruel interest; or

the long-shouting, deep-voiced little mob - still in military formation

- of native soldiers on leave, rejoicing to be rid of their breeches and

<I>puttees</I>, and saying the most outrageous things to the most respectable

women in sight. Even the seller of Ganges-water he did not see, and Kim

expected that he would at least buy a bottle of that precious stuff. He

looked steadily at the ground, and strode as steadily hoar after hour,

his soul busied elsewhere. But Kim was in the seventh heaven of joy. The

Grand Trunk at this point was built on an embankment to guard against winter

floods from the foothills, so that one walked, as it were, a little above

the country, along a stately corridor, seeing all India spread out to left

and right. It was beautiful to behold the many-yoked grain and cotton wagons

crawling over the country roads: one could hear their axles, complaining

a mile away, coming nearer, till with shouts and yells and bad words they

climbed up the steep incline and plunged on to the hard main road, carter

reviling carter. It was equally beautiful to watch the people, little clumps

of red and blue and pink and white and saffron, turning aside to go to

their own villages, dispersing and growing small by twos and threes across

the level plain. Kim felt these things, though he could not give tongue

to his feelings, and so contented himself with buying peeled sugar-cane

and spitting the pith generously about his path. From time to time the

lama took snuff, and at last Kim could endure the silence no longer.



<P>`This is a good land - the land of the South!' said he. `The air is

good; the water is good. Eh?'



<P>`And they are all bound upon the Wheel,' said the lama. `Bound from

life after life. To none of these has the Way been shown.' He shook himself

back to this world.



<P>`And now we have walked a weary way,' said Kim. `Surely we shall soon

come to a <I>parao</I> [a resting-place]. Shall we stay there? Look, the

sun is sloping.'



<P>`Who will receive us this evening?'



<P>`That is all one. This country is full of good folk. Besides' he sunk

his voice beneath a whisper - `we have money.'



<P>The crowd thickened as they neared the resting-place which marked the

end of their day's journey. A line of stalls selling very simple food and

tobacco, a stack of firewood, a police-station, a well, a horse-trough,

a few trees, and, under them, some trampled ground dotted with the black

ashes of old fires, are all that mark a <I>parao</I> on the Grand Trunk;

if you except the beggars and the crows - both hungry.



<P>By this time the sun was driving broad golden spokes through the lower

branches of the mango-trees; the parakeets and doves were coming home in

their hundreds; the chattering, grey-backed Seven Sisters, talking over

the day's adventures, walked back and forth in twos and threes almost under

the feet of the travellers; and shufflings and scufflings in the branches

showed that the bats were ready to go out on the night-picket. Swiftly

the light gathered itself together, painted for an instant the faces and

the cart-wheels and the bullocks' horns as red as blood. Then the night

fell, changing the touch of the air, drawing a low, even haze, like a gossamer

veil of blue, across the face of the country, and bringing out, keen and

distinct, the smell of wood-smoke and cattle and the good scent of wheaten

cakes cooked on ashes. The evening patrol hurried out of the police-station

with important coughings and reiterated orders; and a live charcoal ball

in the cup of a wayside carter's hookah glowed red while Kim's eye mechanically

watched the last flicker of the sun on the brass tweezers.



<P>The life of the <I>parao</I> was very like that of the Kashmir Serai

on a small scale. Kim dived into the happy Asiatic disorder which, if you

only allow time, will bring you everything that a simple man needs.



<P>His wants were few, because, since the lama had no caste scruples, cooked

food from the nearest stall would serve; but, for luxury's sake, Kim bought

a handful of dung-cakes to build a fire. All about, coming and going round

the little flames, men cried for oil, or grain, or sweetmeats, or tobacco,

jostling one another while they waited their turn at the well; and under

the men's voices you heard from halted, shuttered carts the high squeals

and giggles of women whose faces should not be seen in public.



<P>Nowadays, well-educated natives are of opinion that when their womenfolk

travel - and they visit a good deal - it is better to take them quickly

by rail in a properly screened compartment; and that custom is spreading.

But there are always those of the old rock who hold by the use of their

forefathers; and, above all, there are always the old women - more conservative

than the men - who toward the end of their days go on a pilgrimage. They,

being withered and undesirable, do not, under certain circumstances, object

to unveiling. After their long seclusion, during which they have always

been in business touch with a thousand outside interests, they love the

bustle and stir of the open road, the gatherings at the shrines, and the

infinite possibilities of gossip with like-minded dowagers. Very often

it suits a long-suffering family that a strong-tongued, iron-willed old

lady should disport herself about India in this fashion; for certainly

pilgrimage is grateful to the Gods. So all about India, in the most remote

places, as in the most public, you find some knot of grizzled servitors

in nominal charge of an old lady who is more or less curtained and hid

away in a bullock-cart. Such men are staid and discreet, and when a European

or a high-caste native is near will net their charge with most elaborate

precautions; but in the ordinary haphazard chances of pilgrimage the precautions

are not taken. The old lady is, after all, intensely human, and lives to

look upon life.



<P>Kim marked down a gaily ornamented <I>ruth</I> or family bullock-cart,

with a broidered canopy of two domes, like a double-humped camel, which

had just been drawn into the <I>parao</I>. Eight men made its retinue,

and two of the eight were armed with rusty sabres - sure signs that they

followed a person of distinction, for the common folk do not bear arms.

An increasing cackle of complaints, orders, and jests, and what to a European

would have been bad language, came from behind the curtains. Here was evidently

a woman used to command.



<P>Kim looked over the retinue critically. Half of them were thin-legged,

grey-bearded Ooryas from down country. The other half were duffle-clad,

felt-hatted hillmen of the North; and that mixture told its own tale, even

if he had not overheard the incessant sparring between the two divisions.

The old lady was going south on a visit - probably to a rich relative,

most probably to a son-in-law, who had sent up an escort as a mark of respect.

The hillmen would be of her own people - Kulu or Kangra folk. It was quite

clear that she was not taking her daughter down to be wedded, or the curtains

would have been laced home and the guard would have allowed no one near

the car. A merry and a high-spirited dame, thought Kim, balancing the dung-cake

in one hand, the cooked food in the other, and piloting the lama with a

nudging shoulder. Something might be made out of the meeting. The lama

would give him no help, but, as a conscientious <I>chela</I>, Kim was delighted

to beg for two.



<P>He built his fire as close to the cart as he dared, waiting for one

of the escort to order him away. The lama dropped wearily to the ground,

much as a heavy fruit-eating bat cowers, and returned to his rosary.



<P>`Stand farther off, beggar!' The order was shouted in broken Hindustani

by one of the hillmen.



<P>`Huh! It is only a <I>pahari</I> [a hillman]', said Kim over his shoulder.

`Since when have the hill-asses owned all Hindustan?'



<P>The retort was a swift and brilliant sketch of Kim's pedigree for three

generations.



<P>`Ah!' Kim's voice was sweeter than ever, as he broke the dung-cake into

fit pieces. `In <I>my</I> country we call that the beginning of love-talk.'



<P>A harsh, thin cackle behind the curtains put the hillman on his mettle

for a second shot.



<P>`Not so bad - not so bad,' said Kim with calm. `But have a care, my

brother, lest we - <I>we</I>, I say - be minded to give a curse or so in

return. And our curses have the knack of biting home.'



<P>The Ooryas laughed; the hillman sprang forward threateningly. The lama

suddenly raised his head, bringing his huge tam-o'-shanter hat into the

full light of Kim's new-started fire.



<P>`What is it?' said he.



<P>The man halted as though struck to stone. `I - I - am saved from a great

sin,' he stammered.



<P>`The foreigner has found him a priest at last,' whispered one of the

Ooryas.



<P>`<I>Hai</I>! Why is that beggar-brat not well beaten?' the old woman

cried.



<P>The hillman drew back to the cart and whispered something to the curtain.

There was dead silence, then a muttering.



<P>`This goes well,' thought Kim, pretending neither to see nor hear.



<P>`When - when - he has eaten' - the hillman fawned on Kim - `it - it

is requested that the Holy One will do the honour to talk to one who would

speak to him.'



<P>`After he has eaten he will sleep,' Kim returned loftily. He could not

quite see what new turn the game had taken, but stood resolute to profit

by it. `Now I will get him his food.' The last sentence, spoken loudly,

ended with a sigh as of faintness.



<P>`I - I myself and the others of my people will look to that - if - it

is permitted.'



<P>`It is permitted,' said Kim, more loftily than ever. `Holy One, these

people will bring us food.'



<P>`The land is good. All the country of the South is good - a great and

a terrible world,' mumbled the lama drowsily.



<P>`Let him sleep,' said Kim, `but look to it that we are well fed when

he wakes. He is a very holy man.'



<P>Again one of the Ooryas said something contemptuously.



<P>`He is not a <I>fakir</I>. He is not a down-country beggar,' Kim went

on severely, addressing the stars. `He is the most holy of holy men. He

is above all castes. I am his <I>chela</I>.'



<P>`Come here!' said the flat thin voice behind the curtain; and Kim came,

conscious that eyes he could not see were staring at him. One skinny brown

finger heavy with rings lay on the edge of the cart, and the talk went

this way:



<P>`Who is that one?'



<P>`An exceedingly holy one. He comes from far off. He comes from Tibet.'



<P>`Where in Tibet?'



<P>`From behind the snows - from a very far place. He knows the stars;

he makes horoscopes; he reads nativities. But he does not do this for money.

He does it for kindness and great charity. I am his disciple. I am called

also the Friend of the Stars.'



<P>`Thou art no hillman.'



<P>`Ask him. He will tell thee I was sent to him from the Stars to show

him an end to his pilgrimage.'



<P>`Humph! Consider, brat, that I am an old woman and not altogether a

fool. Lamas I know, and to these I give reverence, but thou art no more

a lawful <I>chela</I> than this my finger is the pole of this wagon. Thou

art a casteless Hindu - a bold and unblushing beggar, attached, belike,

to the Holy One for the sake of gain.'



<P>`Do we not all work for gain?' Kim changed his tone promptly to match

that altered voice. `I have heard' - this was a bow drawn at a venture

- `I have heard--'



<P>`What hast thou heard?' she snapped, rapping with the finger.



<P>`Nothing that I well remember, but some talk in the bazars, which is

doubtless a lie, that even Rajahs - small Hill Rajahs--'



<P>`But none the less of good Rajput blood.'



<P>`Assuredly of good blood. That these even sell the more comely of their

womenfolk for gain. Down south they sell them - to <I>zemindars</I> and

such-all of Oudh.'



<P>If there be one thing in the world that the small Hill Rajahs deny it

is just this charge; but it happens to be one thing that the bazars believe,

when they discuss the mysterious slave traffics of India. The old lady

explained to Kim, in a tense, indignant whisper, precisely what manner

and fashion of malignant liar he was. Had Kim hinted this when she was

a girl, he would have been pommelled to death that same evening by an elephant.

This was perfectly true.



<P>`<I>Ahai</I>! I am only a beggar's brat, as the Eye of Beauty has said,'

he wailed in extravagant terror.



<P>`Eye of Beauty, forsooth! Who am I that thou shouldst fling beggar-endearments

at me?' And yet she laughed at the long-forgotten word. `Forty years ago

that might have been said, and not without truth. Ay, thirty years ago.

But it is the fault of this gadding up and down Hind that a king's widow

must jostle all the scum of the land, and be made a mock by beggars.'



<P>`Great Queen,' said Kim promptly, for he heard her shaking with indignation,

`I am even what the Great Queen says I am; but none the less is my master

holy. He has not yet heard the Great Queen's order that--'



<P>`Order? I order a Holy One - a Teacher of the Law - to come and speak

to a woman? Never!'



<P>`Pity my stupidity. I thought it was given as an order--'



<P>`It was not. It was a petition. Does this make all clear?'



<P>A silver coin clicked on the edge of the cart. Kim took it and salaamed

profoundly. The old lady recognized that, as the eyes and the ears of the

lama, he was to be propitiated.



<P>`I am but the Holy One's disciple. When he has eaten perhaps he will

come.'



<P>`Oh, villain and shameless rogue!' The jewelled forefinger shook itself

at him reprovingly; but he could hear the old lady's chuckle.



<P>`Nay, what is it?' he said, dropping into his most caressing and confidential

tone - the one, he well knew, that few could resist. `Is - is there any

need of a son in thy family? Speak freely, for we priests--' That last

was a direct plagiarism from a <I>fakir</I> by the Taksali Gate.



<P>`We priests! Thou art not yet old enough to--' She checked the joke

with another laugh. `Believe me, now and again, we women, O priest, think

of other matters than sons. Moreover, my daughter has borne her man-child.'



<P>`Two arrows in the quiver are better than one; and three are better

still.' Kim quoted the proverb with a meditative cough, looking discreetly

earthward.



<P>`True - oh, true. But perhaps that will come. Certainly those down-country

Brahmins are utterly useless. I sent gifts and monies and gifts again to

them, and they prophesied.'



<P>`Ah,' drawled Kim, with infinite contempt, `they prophesied!' A professional

could have done no better.



<P>`And it was not till I remembered my own Gods that my prayers were heard.

I chose an auspicious hour, and - perhaps thy Holy One has heard of the

Abbot of the Lung-Cho lamassery. It was to him I put the matter, and behold

in the due time all came about as I desired. The Brahmin in the house of

the father of my daughter's son has since said that it was through <I>his</I>

prayers - which is a little error that I will explain to him when we reach

our journey's end. And so afterwards I go to Buddh Gaya, to make <I>shraddha</I>

for the father of my children.'



<P>`Thither go we.'



<P>`Doubly auspicious,' chirruped the old lady. `A second son at least!'



<P>`O Friend of all the World!' The lama had waked, and, simply as a child

bewildered in a strange bed, called for Kim.



<P>`I come! I come, Holy One!' He dashed to the fire, where he found the

lama already surrounded by dishes of food, the hillmen visibly adoring

him and the Southerners looking sourly.



<P>`Go back! Withdraw!' Kim cried. `Do we eat publicly like dogs?' They

finished the meal in silence, each turned a little from the other, and

Kim topped it with a native-made cigarette.



<P>`Have I not said an hundred times that the South is a good land? Here

is a virtuous and high-born widow of a Hill Rajah on pilgrimage, she says,

to Buddh Gaya. She it is sends us those dishes; and when thou art well

rated she would speak to thee.'



<P>`Is this also thy work?' The lama dipped deep into his snuff gourd.



<P>`Who else watched over thee since our wonderful journey began?' Kim's

eyes danced in his head as he blew the rank smoke through his nostrils

and stretched him on the dusty ground. `Have I failed to oversee thy comforts,

Holy One?'



<P>`A blessing on thee.' The lama inclined his solemn head. `I have known

many men in my so long life, and disciples not a few. But to none among

men, if so be thou art woman-born, has my heart gone out as it has to thee

- thoughtful, wise, and courteous; but something of a small imp.'



<P>`And I have never seen such a priest as thou.' Kim considered the benevolent

yellow face wrinkle by wrinkle. `It is less than three days since we took

the road together, and it is as though it were a hundred years.'



<P>`Perhaps in a former life it was permitted that I should have rendered_thee

some service. Maybe' - he smiled - `I freed thee from a trap; or, having

caught thee on a hook in the days when I was not enlightened, cast thee

back into the river.'



<P>`Maybe,' said Kim quietly. He had heard this sort of speculation again

and again, from the mouths of many whom the English would not consider

imaginative. `Now, as regards that woman in the bullock-cart, <I>I</I>

think she needs a second son for her daughter.'



<P>`That is no part of the Way,' sighed the lama. `But at least she is

from the Hills. Ah, the Hills, and the snow of the Hills!'



<P>He rose and stalked to the cart. Kim would have given his ears to come

too, but the lama did not invite him; and the few words he caught were

in an unknown tongue, for they spoke some common speech of the mountains.

The woman seemed to ask questions which the lama turned over in his mind

before answering. Now and again he heard the sing-song cadence of a Chinese

quotation. It was a strange picture that Kim watched between drooped eyelids.

The lama, very straight and erect, the deep folds of his yellow clothing

slashed with black in the light of the <I>parao</I> fires precisely as

a knotted tree-trunk is slashed with the shadows of the low sun, addressed

a tinsel and lacquered <I>ruth</I> which burned like a many-coloured jewel

in the same uncertain light. The patterns on the gold-worked curtains ran

up and down, melting and re-forming as the folds shook and quivered to

the night wind; and when the talk grew more earnest the jewelled forefinger

snapped out little sparks of light between the embroideries. Behind the

cart was a wall of uncertain darkness speckled with little flames and alive

with half-caught forms and faces and shadows. The voices of early evening

had settled down to one soothing hum whose deepest note was the steady

chumping of the bullocks above their chopped straw, and whose highest was

the tinkle of a Bengali dancing-girl's <I>sitar</I>. Most men had eaten

and pulled deep at their gurgling, grunting hookahs, which in full blast

sound like bull-frogs.



<P>At last the lama returned. A hillman walked behind him with a wadded

cotton-quilt and spread it carefully by the fire.



<P>`She deserves ten thousand grandchildren,' thought Kim. `Nonetheless,

but for me, those gifts would not have come.'



<P>`A virtuous woman - and a wise one.' The lama slackened off, joint by

joint, like a slow camel. `The world is full of charity to those who follow

the Way.' He flung a fair half of the quilt over Kim.



<P>`And what said she?' Kim rolled up in his share of it.



<P>`She asked me many questions and propounded many problems - the most

of which were idle tales which she had heard from devil-serving priests

who pretend to follow the Way. Some I answered, and some I said were foolish.

Many wear the Robe, but few keep the Way.'



<P>`True. That is true.' Kim used the thoughtful, conciliatory tone of

those who wish to draw confidences.



<P>`But by her lights she is most right-minded. She desires greatly that

we should go with her to Buddh Gaya; her road being ours, as I understand,

for many days' journey to the southward.'



<P>`And?'



<P>`Patience a little. To this I said that my Search came before all things.

She had heard many foolish legends, but this great truth of my River she

had never heard. Such are the priests of the lower hills! She knew the

Abbot of Lung-Cho, but she did not know of my River - nor the tale of the

Arrow.'



<P>`And?'



<P>`I spoke therefore of the Search, and of the Way, and of matters that

were profitable; she desiring only that I should accompany her and make

prayer for a second son.'



<P>`Aha! `We women' do <I>not</I> think of anything save children,' said

Kim sleepily.



<P>`Now, since our roads run together for a while, I do not see that we

in any way depart from our Search if so be we accompany her - at least

as far as - I have forgotten the name of the city.'



<P>`<I>Oh&eacute;</I>!' said Kim, turning and speaking in a sharp whisper

to one of the Ooryas a few yards away. `Where is your master's house?'



<P>`A little behind Saharunpore, among the fruit gardens.' He named the

village.



<P>`That was the place,' said the lama. `So far, at least, we can go with

her.'



<P>`Flies go to carrion,' said the Oorya, in an abstracted voice.



<P>`For the sick cow a crow; for the sick man a Brahmin.' Kim breathed

the proverb impersonally to the shadow-tops of the trees overhead.



<P>The Oorya grunted and held his peace.



<P>`So then we go with her, Holy One?'



<P>`Is there any reason against? I can still step aside and try all the

rivers that the road overpasses. She desires that I should come. She very

greatly desires it.'



<P>Kim stifled a laugh in the quilt. When once that imperious old lady

had recovered from her natural awe of a lama he thought it probable that

she would be worth listening to.



<P>He was nearly asleep when the lama suddenly quoted a proverb: `The husbands

of the talkative have a great reward hereafter.' Then Kim heard him snuff

thrice, and dozed off, still laughing.



<P>The diamond-bright dawn woke men and crows and bullocks together. Kim

sat up and yawned, shook himself, and thrilled with delight. This was seeing

the world in real truth; this was life as he would have it - bustling and

shouting, the buckling of belts, and beating of bullocks and creaking of

wheels, lighting of fires and cooking of food, and new sights at every

turn of the approving eye. The morning mist swept off in a whorl of silver,

the parrots shot away to some distant river in shrieking green hosts: all

the well-wheels within ear-shot went to work. India was awake, and Kim

was in the middle of it, more awake and more excited than anyone, chewing

on a twig that he would presently use as a toothbrush; for he borrowed

right- and left-handedly from all the customs of the country he knew and

loved. There was no need to worry about food - no need to spend a cowrie

at the crowded stalls. He was the disciple of a holy man annexed by a strong-willed

old lady. All things would be prepared for them, and when they were respectfully

invited so to do they would sit and eat. For the rest - Kim giggled here

as he cleaned his teeth - his hostess would rather heighten the enjoyment

of the road. He inspected her bullocks critically, as they came up grunting

and blowing under the yokes. If they went too fast - it was not likely

- there would be a pleasant seat for himself along the pole; the lama would

sit beside the driver. The escort, of course, would walk. The old lady,

equally of course, would talk a great deal, and by what he had heard that

conversation would not lack salt. She was already ordering, haranguing,

rebuking, and, it must be said, cursing her servants for delays.



<P>`Get her her pipe. In the name of the Gods, get her her pipe and stop

her ill-omened mouth,' cried an Oorya, tying up his shapeless bundles of

bedding. `She and the parrots are alike. They screech in the dawn.'



<P>`The lead-bullocks! <I>Hai</I>! Look to the lead-bullocks!' They were

backing and wheeling as a grain-cart's axle caught them by the horns. `Son

of an owl, where dost thou go?' This to the grinning carter.



<P>`<I>Ai! Yai! Yai</I>! That within there is the Queen of Delhi going

to pray for a son,' the man called back over his high load. `Room for the

Queen of Delhi and her Prime Minister the grey monkey climbing up his own

sword!' Another cart loaded with bark for a down-country tannery followed

close behind, and its driver added a few compliments as the ruth-bullocks

backed and backed again.



<P>From behind the shaking curtains came one volley of invective. It did

not last long, but in kind and quality, in blistering, biting appropriateness,

it was beyond anything that even Kim had heard. He could see the carter's

bare chest collapse with amazement, as the man salaamed reverently to the

voice, leaped from the pole, and helped the escort haul their volcano on

to the main road. Here the voice told him truthfully what sort of wife

he had wedded, and what she was doing in his absence.



<P>`Oh, <I>shabash</I>!' murmured Kim, unable to contain himself, as the

man slunk away.



<P>`Well done, indeed? It is a shame and a scandal that a poor woman may

not go to make prayer to her Gods except she be jostled and insulted by

all the refuse of Hindustan - that she must eat <I>g&icirc;li</I> [abuse]

as men eat <I>ghi</I>. But I have yet a wag left to my tongue - a word

or two well spoken that serves the occasIon. And <I>still</I> am I without

my tobacco! Who is the one-eyed and luckless son of shame that has not

yet prepared my pipe?'



<P>It was hastily thrust in by a hillman, and a trickle of thick smoke

from each corner of the curtains showed that peace was restored.



<P>If Kim had walked proudly the day before, disciple of a holy man, today

he paced with tenfold pride in the train of a semi-royal procession, with

a recognized place under the patronage of an old lady of charming manners

and infinite resource. The escort, their heads tied up native-fashion,

fell in on either side the cart, shuffling enormous clouds of dust.



<P>The lama and Kim walked a little to one side; Kim chewing his stick

of sugar-cane, and making way for no one under the status of a priest.

They could hear the old lady's tongue clack as steadily as a rice-husker.

She bade the escort tell her what was going on on the road; and so soon

as they were clear of the <I>parao</I> she flung back the curtains and

peered out, her veil a third across her face. Her men did not eye her directly

when she addressed them, and thus the proprieties were more or less observed.



<P>A dark, sallowish District Superintendent of Police, faultlessly uniformed,

an Englishman, trotted by on a tired horse, and, seeing from her retinue

what manner of person she was, chaffed her.



<P>`O mother,' he cried, `do they do this in the zenanas? Suppose an Englishman

came by and saw that thou hadst no nose?'



<P>`What?' she shrilled back. `Thine own mother has no nose? Why say so,

then, on the open road?'



<P>It was a fair counter. The Englishman threw up his hand with the gesture

of a man hit at sword-play. She laughed and nodded.



<P>`Is this a face to tempt virtue aside?' She withdrew all her veil and

stared at him.



<P>It was by no means lovely, but as the man gathered up his reins he called

it a Moon of Paradise, a Disturber of Integrity, and a few other fantastic

epithets which doubled her up with mirth.



<P>`That is a <I>nut-cut</I> [rogue],' she said. `All police-constables

are <I>nut-cuts</I>; but the police-wallahs are the worst. <I>Hai</I>,

my son, thou hast never learned all that since thou camest from <I>Belait</I>

[Europe]. Who suckled thee?'



<P>`A <I>pahareen</I> - a hillwoman of Dalhousie, my mother. Keep thy beauty

under a shade - O Dispenser of Delights,' and he was gone.



<P>`These be the sort' - she took a fine judicial tone, and stuffed her

mouth with <I>pan</I> - `These be the sort to oversee justice. They know

the land and the customs of the land. The others, all new from Europe,

suckled by white women and learning our tongues from books, are worse than

the pestilence. They do harm to Kings.' Then she told a long, long tale

to the world at large, of an ignorant young policeman who had disturbed

some small Hill Rajah, a ninth cousin of her own, in the matter of a trivial

land-case, winding up with a quotation from a work by no means devotional.



<P>Then her mood changed, and she bade one of the escort ask whether the

lama would walk alongside and discuss matters of religion. So Kim dropped

back into the dust and returned to his sugar-cane. For an hour or more

the lama's tam-o'-shanter showed like a moon through the haze; and, from

all he heard, Kim gathered that the old woman wept. One of the Ooryas half

apologized for his rudeness overnight, saying that he had never known his

mistress of so bland a temper, and he ascribed it to the presence of the

strange priest. Personally, he believed in Brahmins, though, like all natives,

he was acutely aware of their cunning and their greed. Still, when Brahmins

but irritated with begging demands the mother of his master's wife, and

when she sent them away so angry that they cursed the whole retinue (which

was the real reason of the second off-side bullock going lame, and of the

pole breaking the night before), he was prepared to accept any priest of

any other denomination in or out of India. To this Kim assented with wise

nods, and bade the Oorya observe that the lama took no money, and that

the cost of his and Kim's food would be repaid a hundred times in the good

luck that would attend the caravan henceforward. He also told stories of

Lahore city, and sang a song or two which made the escort laugh. As a town-mouse

well acquainted with the latest songs by the most fashionable composers

- they are women for the most part - Kim had a distinct advantage over

men from a little fruit-village behind Saharunpore, but he let that advantage

be inferred.



<P>At noon they turned aside to eat, and the meal was good, plentiful,

and well-served on plates of clean leaves, in decency, out of drift of

the dust. They gave the scraps to certain beggars, that all requirements

might be fulfilled, and sat down to a long, luxurious smoke. The old lady

had retreated behind her curtains, but mixed most freely in the talk, her

servants arguing with and contradicting her as servants do throughout the

East. She compared the cool and the pines of the Kangra and Kulu hills

with the dust and the mangoes of the South; she told a tale of some old

local Gods at the edge of her husband's territory; she roundly abused the

tobacco which she was then smoking, reviled all Brahmins, and speculated

without reserve on the coming of many grandsons.

<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>Something I owe to the soil that grew--

<BR>More to the life that fed--

<BR>But most to Allah Who gave me two

<BR>Separate sides to my head.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I would go without shirts or shoes,

<BR>Friends, tobacco or bread

<BR>Sooner than for an instant lose

<BR>Either side of my head.



<P><I>The Two-Sided Man.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

`Then in God's name take blue for red,' said Mahbub, alluding to the Hindu

colour of Kim's disreputable turban.



<P>Kim countered with the old proverb, `I will change my faith and my bedding,

but <I>thou</I> must pay for it.'



<P>The dealer laughed till he nearly fell from his horse. At a shop on

the outskirts of the city the change was made, and Kim stood up, externally

at least, a Mohammedan.



<P>Mahbub hired a room over against the railway station, sent for a cooked

meal of the finest with the almond-curd sweet-meats [<I>balushai</I> we

call it] and fine-chopped Lucknow tobacco.



<P>`This is better than some other meat that I ate with the Sikh,' said

Kim, grinning as he squatted, `and assuredly they give no such victuals

at my <I>madrissah</I>.'



<P>`I have a desire to hear of that same <I>madrissah</I>.' Mahbub stuffed

himself with great boluses of spiced mutton fried in fat with cabbage and

golden-brown onIons. `But tell me first, altogether and truthfully, the

manner of thy escape. For, O Friend of all the World,' - he loosed his

cracking belt - `I do not think it is often that a Sahib and the son of

a Sahib runs away from there.'



<P>`How should they? They do not know the land. It was nothing,' said Kim,

and began his tale. When he came to the disguisement and the interview

with the girl in the bazar, Mahbub Ali's gravity went from him. He laughed

aloud and beat his hand on his thigh.



<P>`<I>Shabash! Shabash</I>! Oh, well done, little one! What will the healer

of turquoises say to this? Now, slowly, let us hear what befell afterwards

step by step, omitting nothing.'



<P>Step by step then, Kim told his adventures between coughs as the full-flavoured

tobacco caught his lungs.



<P>`I said,' growled Mahbub Ali to himself, `I <I>said</I> it was the pony

breaking out to play polo. The fruit is ripe already - except that he must

learn his distances and his pacings, and his rods and his compasses. Listen

now. I have turned aside the Colonel's whip from thy skin, and that is

no small service.'



<P>`True.' Kim pulled serenely. `That is true.'



<P>`But it is not to be thought that this running out and in is any way

good.'



<P>`It was my holiday, Hajji. I was a slave for many weeks. Why should

I not run away when the school was shut? Look, too, how I, living upon

my friends or working for my bread, as I did with the Sikh, have saved

the Colonel Sahib a great expense.



<P>Mahbub's lips twitched under his well-pruned Mohammedan moustache.



<P>`What are a few rupees` - the Pathan threw out his open hand carelessly

- `to the Colonel Sahib? He spends them for a purpose, not in any way for

love of thee.'



<P>`That,' said Kim slowly, `I knew a very long time ago.'



<P>`Who told?'



<P>`The Colonel Sahib himself. Not in those many words, but plainly enough

for one who is not altogether a mud-head. Yea, he told me in the <I>te-rain</I>

when we went down to Lucknow.'



<P>`Be it so. Then I will tell thee more, Friend of all the World, though

in the telling I lend thee my head.'



<P>`It was forfeit to me,' said Kim, with deep relish, `in Umballa, when

thou didst pick me up on the horse after the drummer-boy beat me.'



<P>`Speak a little plainer. All the world may tell lies save thou and I.

For equally is thy life forfeit to me if I chose to raise my finger here.'



<P>`And this is known to me also,' said Kim, readjusting the live charcoal-ball

on the weed. `It is a very sure tie between us. Indeed, thy hold is surer

even than mine; for who would miss a boy beaten to death, or, it may be,

thrown into a well by the roadside? Most people here and in Simla and across

the passes behind the Hills would, on the other hand, say: `What has come

to Mahbub Ali?' if he were found dead among his horses. Surely, too, the

Colonel Sahib would make inquiries. But again,' - Kim's face puckered with

cunning, - `he would not make overlong inquiry, lest people should ask:

`What has this Colonel Sahib to do with that horse-dealer?' But I - if

I lived - '



<P>`As thou wouldst surely die - '



<P>`Maybe; but I say, <I>if</I> I lived, I, and I alone, would know that

one had come by night, as a common thief perhaps, to Mahbub Ali's bulkhead

in the serai, and there had slain him, either before or after that thief

had made a full search into his saddlebags and between the soles of his

slippers. Is that news to tell to the Colonel, or would he say to me -

(I have not forgotten when he sent me back for a cigar-case that he had

<I>not</I> left behind him) - `What is Mahbub Ali to me?'?'



<P>Up went a gout of heavy smoke. There was a long pause: then Mahbub Ali

spoke in admiration: `And with these things on thy mind, dost thou lie

down and rise again among all the Sahibs' little sons at the <I>madrissah</I>

and meekly take instruction from thy teachers?'



<P>`It is an order,' said Kim blandly. `Who am I to dispute an order?'



<P>`A most finished Son of Eblis,' said Mahbub Ali. `But what is this tale

of the thief and the search?'



<P>`That which I saw,' said Kim, `the night that my lama and I lay next

thy place in the Kashmir Serai. The door was left unlocked, which I think

is not thy custom, Mahbub. He came in as one assured that thou wouldst

not soon return. My eye was against a knot-hole in the plank. He searched

as it were for something - not a rug, not stirrups, nor a bridle, nor brass

pots - something little and most carefully hid. Else why did he prick with

an iron between the soles of thy slippers?'



<P>`Ha!' Mahbub Ali smiled gently. `And seeing these things, what tale

didst thou fashion to thyself; Well of the Truth?'



<P>`None. I put my hand upon my amulet, which lies always next to my skin,

and, remembering the pedigree of a white stallion that I had bitten out

of a piece of Mussalmani bread, I went away to Umballa perceiving that

a heavy trust was laid upon me. At that hour, had I chosen, thy head was

forfeit. It needed only to say to that man, `I have here a paper concerning

a horse which I cannot read.' And then?' Kim peered at Mahbub under his

eyebrows.



<P>`Then thou wouldst have drunk water twice - perhaps thrice, afterwards.

I do not think more than thrice,' said Mahbub simply.



<P>`It is true. I thought of that a little, but most I thought that I loved

thee, Mahbub. Therefore I went to Umballa, as thou knowest, but (and this

thou dost not know) I lay hid in the garden-grass to see what Colonel Creighton

Sahib might do upon reading the white stallion's pedigree.'



<P>`And what did he?' for Kim had bitten off the conversation.



<P>`Dost <I>thou</I> give news for love, or dost thou sell it?' Kim asked.



<P>`I sell and - I buy.' Mahbub took a four-anna piece out of his belt

and held it up.



<P>`Eight!' said Kim, mechanically following the huckster instinct of the

East.



<P>Mahbub laughed, and put away the coin. `It is too easy to deal in that

market, Friend of all the World. Tell me for love. Our lives lie in each

other's hand.'



<P>`Very good. I saw the <I>Jang-i-Lat Sahib</I> [the Commander-in-Chief]

come to a big dinner. I saw him in Creighton Sahib's office. I saw the

two read the white stallion's pedigree. I heard the very orders given for

the opening of a great war.'



<P>`Hah!' Mahbub nodded with deepest eyes afire. `The game is well played.

That war is done now, and the evil, we hope, nipped before the flower -

thanks to me - and thee. What didst thou later?'



<P>`I made the news as it were a hook to catch me victual and honour among

the villagers in a village whose priest drugged my lama. But I bore away

the old man's purse, and the Brahmin found nothing. So next morning he

was angry. Ho! Ho! And I also used the news when I fell into the hands

of that white Regiment with their Bull!'



<P>`That was foolishness.' Mahbub scowled. `News is not meant to be thrown

about like dung-cakes, but used sparingly - like <I>bhang</I>.'



<P>`So I think now, and moreover, it did me no sort of good. But that was

very long ago,' he made as to brush it all away with a thin brown hand

- `and since then, and especially in the nights under the <I>punkah</I>

at the <I>madrissah</I>, I have thought very greatly.'



<P>`Is it permitted to ask whither the Heaven-born's thought might have

led?' said Mahbub, with an elaborate sarcasm, smoothing his scarlet beard.



<P>`It is permitted,' said Kim, and threw back the very tone. `They say

at Nucklao that no Sahib must tell a black man that he has made a fault.'



<P>Mahbub's hand shot into his bosom, for to call a Pathan a <I>black man</I>

[<I>kala admi</I>] is a blood-insult. Then he remembered and laughed. `Speak,

Sahib. Thy black man hears.'



<P>`But,' said Kim, `I am <I>not</I> a Sahib, and I say I made a fault

to curse thee, Mahbub Ali, on that day at Umballa when I thought I was

betrayed by a Pathan. I was senseless; for I was but newly caught, and

I wished to kill that low-caste drummer-boy. I say now, Hajji, that it

was well done; and I see my road all clear before me to a good service.

I will stay in the <I>madrissah</I> till I am ripe.'



<P>`Well said. Especially are distances and numbers and the manner of using

compasses to be learned in that game. One waits in the Hills above to show

thee.'



<P>`I will learn their teaching upon a condition - that my time is given

to me without question when the <I>madrissah</I> is shut. Ask that for

me of the Colonel.'



<P>`But why not ask the Colonel in the Sahibs' tongue?'



<P>`The Colonel is the servant of the Government. He is sent hither and

yon at a word, and must consider his own advancement. (See how much I have

already learned at Nucklao!) Moreover, the Colonel I know since three months

only. I have known one Mahbub Ali for six years. So! To the <I>madrissah</I>

I will go. At the <I>madrissah</I> I will learn. In the <I>madrissah</I>

I will be a Sahib. But when the <I>madrissah</I> is shut, then must I be

free and go among my people. Otherwise I die!'



<P>`And who are thy people, Friend of all the World?'



<P>`This great and beautiful land,' said Kim, waving his paw round the

little clay-walled room where the oil-lamp in its niche burned heavily

through the tobacco-smoke. `And, further, I would see my lama again. And,

further, I need money.'



<P>`That is the need of everyone,' said Mahbub ruefully. `I will give thee

eight annas, for much money is not picked out of horses' hooves, and it

must suffice for many days. As to all the rest, I am well pleased, and

no further talk is needed. Make haste to learn, and in three years, or

it may be less, thou wilt be an aid - even to me.



<P>`Have I been such a hindrance till now?' said Kim, with a boy's giggle.



<P>`Do not give answers,' Mahbub grunted. `Thou art my new horse-boy. Go

and bed among my men. They are near the north end of the station, with

the horses.'



<P>`They will beat me to the south end of the station if I come without

authority.'



<P>Mahbub felt in his belt, wetted his thumb on a cake of Chinese ink,

and dabbed the impression on a piece of soft native paper. From Balkh to

Bombay men know that rough-ridged print with the old scar running diagonally

across it.



<P>`That is enough to show my headman. I come in the morning.'



<P>`By which road?' said Kim.



<P>`By the road from the city. There is but one, and then we return to

Creighton Sahib. I have saved thee a beating.'



<P>`Allah! What is a beating when the very head is loose on the shoulders?'



<P>Kim slid out quietly into the night, walked half round the house, keeping

close to the walls, and headed away from the station for a mile or so.

Then, fetching a wide compass, he worked back at leisure, for he needed

time to invent a story if any of Mahbub's retainers asked questions.



<P>They were camped on a piece of waste ground beside the railway, and,

being natives, had not, of course, unloaded the two trucks in which Mahbub's

animals stood among a consignment of country-breds bought by the Bombay

tram-company. The headman, a broken-down, consumptive-looking Mohammedan,

promptly challenged Kim, but was pacified at sight of Mahbub's sign-manual.



<P>`The Hajji has of his favour given me service,' said Kim testily. `If

this be doubted, wait till he comes in the morning. Meantime, a place by

the fire.'



<P>Followed the usual aimless babble that every low-caste native must raise

on every occasion. It died down, and Kim lay out behind the little knot

of Mahbub's followers, almost under the wheels of a horse-truck, a borrowed

blanket for covering. Now a bed among brickbats and ballast-refuse on a

damp night, between overcrowded horses and unwashed Baltis, would not appeal

to many white boys; but Kim was utterly happy. Change of scene, service,

and surroundings were the breath of his little nostrils, and thinking of

the neat white cots of St Xavier's all arow under the punkah gave him joy

as keen as the repetition of the multiplication-table in English.



<P>`I am very old,' he thought sleepily. `Every month I become a year more

old. I was very young, and a fool to boot, when I took Mahbub's message

to Umballa. Even when I was with that white Regiment I was very young and

small and had no wisdom. But now I learn every day, and in three years

the Colonel will take me out of the <I>madrissah</I> and let me go upon

the Road with Mahbub hunting for horses' pedigrees, or maybe I shall go

by myself; or maybe I shall find the lama and go with him. Yes; that is

best. To walk again as a <I>chela</I> with my lama when he comes back to

Benares.' The thoughts came more slowly and disconnectedly. He was plunging

into a beautiful dreamland when his ears caught a whisper, thin and sharp,

above the monotonous babble round the fire. It came from behind the iron-skinned

horse-truck.



<P>`He is not here, then?'



<P>`Where should he be but roystering in the city. Who looks for a rat

in a frog-pond? Come away. He is not our man.'



<P>`He must not go back beyond the Passes a second time. It is the order.'



<P>`Hire some woman to drug him. It is a few rupees only, and there is

no evidence.'



<P>`Except the woman. It must be more certain; and remember the price upon

his head.'



<P>`Ay, but the police have a long arm, and we are far from the Border.

If it were in Peshawur, now!'



<P>`Yes - in Peshawur,' the second voice sneered. `Peshawur, full of his

blood-kin - full of bolt-holes and women behind whose clothes he will hide.

Yes, Peshawur or Jehannum would suit us equally well.'



<P>`Then what is the plan?'



<P>`O fool, have I not told it a hundred times? Wait till he comes to lie

down, and then one sure shot. The trucks are between us and pursuit. We

have but to run back over the lines and go our way. They will not see whence

the shot came. Wait here at least till the dawn. What manner of <I>fakir</I>

art thou, to shiver at a little watching?'



<P>`Oho!' thought Kim, behind close-shut eyes. `Once again it is Mahbub.

Indeed a white stallion's pedigree is not a good thing to peddle to Sahibs!

Or maybe Mahbub has been selling other news. Now what is to do, Kim? I

know not where Mahbub houses, and if he comes here before the dawn they

will shoot him. That would be no profit for thee, Kim. And this is not

a matter for the police. That would be no profit for Mahbub; and' - he

giggled almost aloud - `I do not remember any lesson at Nucklao which will

help me. Allah! Here is Kim and yonder are they. First, then, Kim must

wake and go away, so that they shall not suspect. A bad dream wakes a man

- thus - '



<P>He threw the blanket off his face, and raised himself suddenly with

the terrible, bubbling, meaningless yell of the Asiatic roused by nightmare.



<P>`Urr-urr-urr-urr! Ya-la-la-la-la! <I>Narain</I>! The <I>churel</I>!

The <I>churel</I>!'



<P>A <I>churel</I> is the peculiarly malignant ghost of a woman who has

died in child-bed. She haunts lonely roads, her feet are turned backwards

on the ankles, and she leads men to torment.



<P>Louder rose Kim's quavering howl, till at last he leaped to his feet

and staggered off sleepily, while the camp cursed him for waking them.

Some twenty yards farther up the line he lay down again, taking care that

the whisperers should hear his grunts and groans as he recomposed himself.

After a few minutes he rolled towards the road and stole away into the

thick darkness.



<P>He paddled along swiftly till he came to a culvert, and dropped behind

it, his chin on a level with the coping-stone. Here he could command all

the night-traffic, himself unseen.



<P>Two or three carts passed, jingling out to the suburbs; a coughing policeman

and a hurrying foot-passenger or two who sang to keep off evil spirits.

Then rapped the shod feet of a horse.



<P>`Ah! This is more like Mahbub,' thought Kim, as the beast shied at the

little head above the culvert.



<P>`Ohe, Mahbub Ali,' he whispered, `have a care!'



<P>The horse was reined back almost on its haunches, and forced towards

the culvert.



<P>`Never again,' said Mahbub, `will I take a shod horse for night-work.

They pick up all the bones and nails in the city.' He stooped to lift its

forefoot, and that brought his head within a foot of Kim's. `Down - keep

down,' he muttered. `The night is full of eyes.'



<P>`Two men wait thy coming behind the horse-trucks. They will shoot thee

at thy lying down, because there is a price on thy head. I heard, sleeping

near the horses.'



<P>`Didst thou see them?... Hold still, Sire of Devils!' This furiously

to the horse.



<P>`No.'



<P>`Was one dressed belike as a <I>fakir</I>?'



<P>`One said to the other, `What manner of <I>fakir</I> art thou, to shiver

at a little watching?''



<P>`Good. Go back to the camp and lie down. I do not die tonight.'



<P>Mahbub wheeled his horse and vanished. Kim tore back down the ditch

till he reached a point opposite his second resting-place, slipped across

the road like a weasel, and re-coiled himself in the blanket.



<P>`At least Mahbub knows,' he thought contentedly. `And certainly he spoke

as one expecting it. I do not think those two men will profit by tonight's

watch.'



<P>An hour passed, and, with the best will in the world to keep awake all

night, he slept deeply. Now and again a night train roared along the metals

within twenty feet of him; but he had all the Oriental's indifference to

mere noise, and it did not even weave a dream through his slumber.



<P>Mahbub was anything but asleep. It annoyed him vehemently that people

outside his tribe and unaffected by his casual amours should pursue him

for the life. His first and natural impulse was to cross the line lower

down, work up again, and, catching his well-wishers from behind, summarily

slay them. Here, he reflected with sorrow, another branch of the Government,

totally unconnected with Colonel Creighton, might demand explanations which

would be hard to supply; and he knew that south of the Border a perfectly

ridiculous fuss is made about a corpse or so. He had not been troubled

in this way since he sent Kim to Umballa with the message, and hoped that

suspicion had been finally diverted.



<P>Then a most brilliant notion struck him.



<P>`The English do eternally tell the truth,' he said, `therefore we of

this country are eternally made foolish. By Allah, I will tell the truth

to an Englishman! Of what use is the Government police if a poor Kabuli

be robbed of his horses in their very trucks. This is as bad as Peshawur!

I should lay a complaint at the station. Better still, some young Sahib

on the Railway! They are zealous, and if they catch thieves it is remembered

to their honour.'



<P>He tied up his horse outside the station, and strode on to the platform.



<P>`Hullo, Mahbub Ali!' said a young Assistant District Traffic Superintendent

who was waiting to go down the line - a tall, tow-haired, horsey youth

in dingy white linen. `What are you doing here? Selling weeds - eh?'



<P>`No; I am not troubled for my horses. I come to look for Lutuf Ullah.

I have a truck-load up the line. Could anyone take them out without the

Railway's knowledge?'



<P>`Shouldn't think so, Mahbub. You can claim against us if they do.'



<P>`I have seen two men crouching under the wheels of one of the trucks

nearly all night. <I>fakirs</I> do not steal horses, so I gave them no

more thought. I would find Lutuf Ullah, my partner.'



<P>`The deuce you did? And you didn't bother your head about it? 'Pon my

word, it's just almost as well that I met you. What were they like, eh?'



<P>`They were only <I>fakirs</I>. They will no more than take a little

grain, perhaps, from one of the trucks. There are many up the line. The

State will never miss the dole. I came here seeking for my partner, Lutuf

Ullah - '



<P>`Never mind your partner. Where are your horse-trucks?'



<P>`A little to this side of the farthest place where they make lamps for

the trains.'



<P>`The signal-box! Yes.'



<P>`And upon the rail nearest to the road upon the right-hand side - looking

up the line thus. But as regards Lutuf Ullah - a tall man with a broken

nose, and a Persian greyhound - Aie!'



<P>The boy had hurried off to wake up a young and enthusiastic policeman;

for, as he said, the Railway had suffered much from depredations in the

goods-yard. Mahbub Ali chuckled in his dyed beard.



<P>`They will walk in their boots, making a noise, and then they will wonder

why there are no <I>fakirs</I>. They are very clever boys - Barton Sahib

and Young Sahib.'



<P>He waited idly for a few minutes, expecting to see them hurry up the

line girt for action. A light engine slid through the station, and he caught

a glimpse of young Barton in the cab.



<P>`I did that child an injustice. He is not altogether a fool,' said Mahbub

Ali. `To take a fire-carriage for a thief is a new game!'



<P>When Mahbub Ali came to his camp in the dawn, no one thought it worth

while to tell him any news of the night. No one, at least, but one small

horseboy, newly advanced to the great man's service, whom Mahbub called

to his tiny tent to assist in some packing.



<P>`It is all known to me,' whispered Kim, bending above saddlebags. `Two

Sahibs came up on a <I>te-train</I>. I was running to and fro in the dark

on this side of the trucks as the <I>te-train</I> moved up and down slowly.

They fell upon two men sitting under this truck - Hajji, what shall I do

with this lump of tobacco? Wrap it in paper and put it under the salt-bag?

Yes - and struck them down. But one man struck at a Sahib with a <I>fakir's</I>

buck's horn' (Kim meant the conjoined black-buck horns, which are a <I>fakir's</I>

sole temporal weapon) - `the blood came. So the other Sahib, first smiting

his own man senseless, smote the stabber with a short gun which had rolled

from the first man's hand. They all raged as though mad together.'



<P>Mahbub smiled with heavenly resignation. `No! That is not so much <I>dewanee</I>

[madness, or a case for the civil court - the word can be punned upon both

ways] as <I>nizamut</I> [a criminal case]. A gun, sayest thou? Ten good

years in jail.'



<P>`Then they both lay still, but I think they were nearly dead when they

were put on the <I>te-train</I>. Their heads moved thus. And there is much

blood on the line. Come and see?'



<P>`I have seen blood before. Jail is the sure place - and assuredly they

will give false names, and assuredly no man will find them for a long time.

They were unfriends of mine. Thy fate and mine seem on one string. What

a tale for the healer of pearls! Now swiftly with the saddle-bags and the

cooking-platter. We will take out the horses and away to Simla.'



<P>Swiftly - as Orientals understand speed - with long explanations, with

abuse and windy talk, carelessly, amid a hundred checks for little things

forgotten, the untidy camp broke up and led the half-dozen stiff and fretful

horses along the Kalka road in the fresh of the rain-swept dawn. Kim, regarded

as Mahbub Ali's favourite by all who wished to stand well with the Pathan,

was not called upon to work. They strolled on by the easiest of stages,

halting every few hours at a wayside shelter. Very many Sahibs travel along

the Kalka road; and, as Mahbub Ali says, every young Sahib must needs esteem

himself a judge of a horse, and, though he be over head in debt to the

money-lender, must make as if to buy. That was the reason that Sahib after

Sahib, rolling along in a stage-carriage, would stop and open talk. Some

would even descend from their vehicles and feel the horses' legs; asking

inane questions, or, through sheer ignorance of the vernacular, grossly

insulting the imperturbable trader.



<P>`When first I dealt with Sahibs, and that was when Colonel Soady Sahib

was Governor of Fort Abazai and flooded the Commissioner's camping-ground

for spite,' Mahbub confided to Kim as the boy filled his pipe under a tree,

`I did not know how greatly they were fools, and this made me wroth. As

thus - ' and he told Kim a tale of an expression, misused in all innocence,

that doubled Kim up with mirth. `Now I see, however,' - he exhaled smoke

slowly - `that it is with them as with all men - in certain matters they

are wise, and in others most foolish. Very foolish it is to use the wrong

word to a stranger; for though the heart may be clean of offence, how is

the stranger to know that? He is more like to search truth with a dagger.'



<P>`True. True talk,' said Kim solemnly. `Fools speak of a cat when a woman

is brought to bed, for instance. I have heard them.'



<P>`Therefore, in one situate as thou art, it particularly behoves thee

to remember this with both kinds of faces. Among Sahibs, never forgetting

thou art a Sahib; among the folk of Hind, always remembering thou art -

' He paused, with a puzzled smile.



<P>`What am I? Mussalman, Hindu, Jain, or Buddhist? That is a hard knot.'



<P>`Thou art beyond question an unbeliever, and therefore thou wilt be

damned. So says my Law - or I think it does. But thou art also my Little

Friend of all the World, and I love thee. So says my heart. This matter

of creeds is like horseflesh. The wise man knows horses are good - that

there is a profit to be made from all; and for myself - but that I am a

good <I>Sunni</I> and hate the men of Tirah - I could believe the same

of all the Faiths. Now manifestly a Kathiawar mare taken from the sands

of her birthplace and removed to the west of Bengal founders - nor is even

a Balkh stallion (and there are no better horses than those of Balkh, were

they not so heavy in the shoulder) of any account in the great Northern

deserts beside the snow-camels I have seen. Therefore I say in my heart

the Faiths are like the horses. Each has merit in its own country.'



<P>`But my lama said altogether a different thing.'



<P>`Oh, he is an old dreamer of dreams from Bhotiyal. My heart is a little

angry, Friend of all the World, that thou shouldst see such worth in a

man so little known.'



<P>`It is true, Hajji; but that worth do I see, and to him my heart is

drawn.'



<P>`And his to thine, I hear. Hearts are like horses. They come and they

go against bit or spur. Shout Gul Sher Khan yonder to drive in that bay

stallion's pickets more firmly. We do not want a horse-fight at every resting-stage,

and the dun and the black will be locked in a little... Now hear me. Is

it necessary to the comfort of thy heart to see that lama?'



<P>`It is one part of my bond,' said Kim. `If I do not see him, and if

he is taken from me, I will go out of that <I>madrissah</I> in Nucklao

and, and - once gone, who is to find me again?'



<P>`It is true. Never was colt held on a lighter heel-rope than thou.'

Mahbub nodded his head.



<P>`Do not be afraid.' Kim spoke as though he could have evanished on the

moment. `My lama has said that he will come to see me at the <I>madrissah</I>

- '



<P>`A beggar and his bowl in the presence of those young Sa - '



<P>`Not all!' Kim cut in with a snort. `Their eyes are blued and their

nails are blackened with low-caste blood, many of them. Sons of <I>mehteranees</I>

- brothers-in-law to the <I>bhungi</I> [sweeper].'



<P>We need not follow the rest of the pedigree; but Kim made his little

point clearly and without heat, chewing a piece of sugar-cane the while.



<P>`Friend of all the World,' said Mahbub, pushing over the pipe for the

boy to clean, `I have met many men, women, and boys, and not a few Sahibs.

I have never in all my days met such an imp as thou art.'



<P>`And why? When I always tell thee the truth.'



<P>`Perhaps the very reason, for this is a world of danger to honest men.'

Mahbub Ali hauled himself off the ground, girt in his belt, and went over

to the horses.



<P>`Or sell it?'



<P>There was that in the tone that made Mahbub halt and turn. `What new

devilry?'



<P>`Eight annas, and I will tell,' said Kim, grinning. `It touches thy

peace.'



<P>`O <I>Shaitan</I>!' Mahbub gave the money.



<P>`Rememberest thou the little business of the thieves in the dark, down

yonder at Umballa?'



<P>`Seeing they sought my life, I have not altogether forgotten. Why?'



<P>`Rememberest thou the Kashmir Serai?'



<P>`I will twist thy ears in a moment - Sahib.'



<P>`No need - Pathan. Only, the second <I>fakir</I>, whom the Sahibs beat

senseless, was the man who came to search thy bulkhead at Lahore. I saw

his face as they helped him on the engine. The very same man.'



<P>`Why didst thou not tell before?'



<P>`Oh, he will go to jail, and be safe for some years. There is no need

to tell more than is necessary at any one time. Besides, I did not then

need money for sweetmeats.'



<P>`<I>Allah kerim</I>!' said Mahbub Ali. `Wilt thou some day sell my head

for a few sweetmeats if the fit takes thee?'&nbsp;

<HR>Kim will remember till he dies that long, lazy journey from Umballa,

through Kalka and the Pinjore Gardens near by, up to Simla. A sudden spate

in the Gugger River swept down one horse (the most valuable, be sure),

and nearly drowned Kim among the dancing boulders. Farther up the road

the horses were stampeded by a Government elephant, and being in high condition

of grass food, it cost a day and a half to get them together again. Then

they met Sikandar Khan coming down with a few unsaleable screws - remnants

of his string - and Mahbub, who has more of horse-coping in his little

fingernail than Sikandar Khan in all his tents, must needs buy two of the

worst, and that meant eight hours' laborious diplomacy and untold tobacco.

But it was all pure delight - the wandering road, climbing, dipping, and

sweeping about the growing spurs; the flush of the morning laid along the

distant snows; the branched cacti, tier upon tier on the stony hillsides;

the voices of a thousand water-channels; the chatter of the monkeys; the

solemn deodars, climbing one after another with down-drooped branches;

the vista of the Plains rolled out far beneath them; the incessant twanging

of the tonga-horns and the wild rush of the led horses when a tonga swung

round a curve; the halts for prayers (Mahbub was very religious in dry-washings

and bellowings when time did not press); the evening conferences by the

halting-places, when camels and bullocks chewed solemnly together and the

stolid drivers told the news of the Road - all these things lifted Kim's

heart to song within him.



<P>`But, when the singing and dancing is done,' said Mahbub Ali, `comes

the Colonel Sahib's, and that is not so sweet.'



<P>`A fair land - a most beautiful land is this of Hind - and the land

of the Five Rivers is fairer than all,' Kim half chanted. `Into it I will

go again if Mahbub Ali or the Colonel lift hand or foot against me. Once

gone, who shall find me? Look, Hajji, is yonder the city of Simla? Allah,

what a city!'



<P>`My father's brother, and he was an old man when Mackerson Sahib's well

was new at Peshawur, could recall when there were but two houses in it.'



<P>He led the horses below the main road into the lower Simla bazar - the

crowded rabbit-warren that climbs up from the valley to the Town Hall at

an angle of forty-five. A man who knows his way there can defy all the

police of India's summer capital, so cunningly does veranda communicate

with veranda, alley-way with alley-way, and bolt-hole with bolt-hole. Here

live those who minister to the wants of the glad city - <I>jhampanis</I>

who pull the pretty ladies' `rickshaws by night and gamble till the dawn;

grocers, oil-sellers, curio-vendors, firewood-dealers, priests, pickpockets,

and native employees of the Government. Here are discussed by courtesans

the things which are supposed to be profoundest secrets of the India Council;

and here gather all the sub-sub-agents of half the Native States. Here,

too, Mahbub Ali rented a room, much more securely locked than his bulkhead

at Lahore, in the house of a Mohammedan cattle-dealer. It was a place of

miracles, too, for there went in at twilight a Mohammedan horseboy, and

there came out an hour later a Eurasian lad - the Lucknow girl's dye was

of the best - in badly-fitting shop-clothes.



<P>`I have spoken with Creighton Sahib,' quoth Mahbub Ali, `and a second

time has the Hand of Friendship averted the Whip of Calamity. He says that

thou hast altogether wasted sixty days upon the Road, and it is too late,

therefore, to send thee to any Hill-school.'



<P>`I have said that my holidays are my own. I do not go to school twice

over. That is one part of my bond.'



<P>`The Colonel Sahib is not yet aware of that contract. Thou art to lodge

in Lurgan Sahib's house till it is time to go again to Nucklao.'



<P>`I had sooner lodge with thee, Mahbub.'



<P>`Thou dost not know the honour. Lurgan Sahib himself asked for thee.

Thou wilt go up the hill and along the road atop, and there thou must forget

for a while that thou hast ever seen or spoken to me, Mahbub Ali, who sells

horses to Creighton Sahib, whom thou dost not know. Remember this order.'



<P>Kim nodded. `Good,' said he, `and who is Lurgan Sahib? Nay' - he caught

Mahbub's sword-keen glance - `indeed I have never heard his name. Is he

by chance' - he lowered his voice - `one of us?'



<P>`What talk is this of <I>us</I>, Sahib?' Mahbub Ali returned, in the

tone he used towards Europeans. `I am a Pathan; thou art a Sahib and the

son of a Sahib. Lurgan Sahib has a shop among the European shops. All Simla

knows it. Ask there... and, Friend of all the World, he is one to be obeyed

to the last wink of his eyelashes. Men say he does magic, but that should

not touch thee. Go up the hill and ask. Here begins the Great Game.'

<P>Yea, voice of every Soul that clung

<P><I>Buddha at Kamakura.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

Behind them an angry farmer brandished a bamboo pole. He was a market-gardener,

Arain by caste, growing vegetables and flowers for Umballa city, and well

Kim knew the breed.



<P>`Such an one,' said the lama, disregarding the dogs, `is impolite to

strangers, intemperate of speech and uncharitable. Be warned by his demeanour,

my disciple.'



<P>`Ho, shameless beggars!' shouted the farmer. `Begone! Get hence!'



<P>`We go,' the lama returned, with quiet dignity. `We go from these unblessed

fields.'



<P>`Ah,' said Kim, sucking in his breath. `If the next crops fail, thou

canst only blame thine own tongue.'



<P>The man shuffled uneasily in his slippers. `The land is full of beggars,'

he began, half apologetically.



<P>`And by what sign didst thou know that we would beg from thee, O <I>Mali</I>?'

said Kim tartly, using the name that a market-gardener least likes. `All

we sought was to look at that river beyond the field there.'



<P>`River, forsooth!' the man snorted. `What city do ye hail from not to

know a canal-cut? It runs as straight as an arrow, and I pay for the water

as though it were molten silver. There is a branch of a river beyond. But

if ye need water I can give that - and milk.'



<P>`Nay, we will go to the river,' said the lama, striding out.



<P>`Milk and a meal,' the man stammered, as he looked at the strange tall

figure. `I - I would not draw evil upon myself - or my crops. But beggars

are so many in these hard days.'



<P>`Take notice.' The lama turned to Kim. `He was led to speak harshly

by the Red Mist of anger. That clearing from his eyes, he becomes courteous

and of an affable heart. May his fields be blessed! Beware not to judge

men too hastily, O farmer.'



<P>`I have met holy ones who would have cursed thee from hearthstone to

byre,' said Kim to the abashed man. `Is he not wise and holy? I am his

disciple.'



<P>He cocked his nose in the air loftily and stepped across the narrow

field-borders with great dignity.



<P>`There is no pride,' said the lama, after a pause, `there is no pride

among such as follow the Middle Way.'



<P>`But thou hast said he was low-caste and discourteous.'



<P>`Low-caste I did not say, for how can that be which is not? Afterwards

he amended his discourtesy, and I forgot the offence. Moreover, he is as

we are, bound upon the Wheel of Things; but he does not tread the way of

deliverance.' He halted at a little runlet among the fields, and considered

the hoof-pitted bank.



<P>`Now, how wilt thou know thy River?' said Kim, squatting in the shade

of some tall sugar-cane.



<P>`When I find it, an enlightenment will surely be given. This, I feel,

is not the place. O littlest among the waters, if only thou couldst tell

me where runs my River! But be thou blessed to make the fields bear!'



<P>`Look! Look!' Kim sprang to his side and dragged him back. A yellow-and-brown

streak glided from the purple rustling stems to the bank, stretched its

neck to the water, drank, and lay still - a big cobra with fixed, lidless

eyes.



<P>`I have no stick - I have no stick,' said Kim. `I will get me one and

break his back.'



<P>`Why? He is upon the Wheel as we are - a life ascending or descending

- very far from deliverance. Great evil must the soul have done that is

cast into this shape.'



<P>`I hate all snakes,' said Kim. No native training can quench the white

man's horror of the Serpent.



<P>`Let him live out his life.' The coiled thing hissed and half opened

its hood. `May thy release come soon, brother!' the lama continued placidly.

`Hast <I>thou</I> knowledge, by chance, of my River?'



<P>`Never have I seen such a man as thou art,' Kim whispered, overwhelmed.

`Do the very snakes understand thy talk?'



<P>`Who knows?' He passed within a foot of the cobra's poised head. It

flattened itself among the dusty coils.



<P>`Come, thou!' he called over his shoulder.



<P>`Not I,' said Kim. `I go round.'



<P>`Come. He does no hurt.'



<P>Kim hesitated for a moment. The lama backed his order by some droned

Chinese quotation which Kim took for a charm. He obeyed and bounded across

the rivulet, and the snake, indeed, made no sign.



<P>`Never have I seen such a man.' Kim wiped the sweat from his forehead.

`And now, whither go we?'



<P>`That is for thee to say. I am old, and a stranger - far from my own

place. But that the <I>r&amp;ccirc;l</I>-carriage fills my head with noises

of devil-drums I would go in it to Benares now... Yet by so going we may

miss the River. Let us find another river.'



<P>Where the hard-worked soil gives three and even four crops a year -

through patches of sugar-cane, tobacco, long white radishes, and <I>nol-kol</I>,

all that day they strolled on, turning aside to every glimpse of water;

rousing village dogs and sleeping villages at noonday; the lama replying

to the volleyed questions with an unswerving simplicity. They sought a

River - a River of miraculous healing. Had any one knowledge of such a

stream? Sometimes men laughed, but more often heard the story out to the

end and offered them a place in the shade, a drink of milk, and a meal.

The women were always kind, and the little children as children are the

world over, alternately shy and venturesome. Evening found them at rest

under the village tree of a mud-walled, mud-roofed hamlet, talking to the

headman as the cattle came in from the grazing-grounds and the women prepared

the day's last meal. They had passed beyond the belt of market-gardens

round hungry Umballa, and were among the mile-wide green of the staple

crops.



<P>He was a white-bearded and affable elder, used to entertaining strangers.

He dragged out a string bedstead for the lama, set warm cooked food before

him, prepared him a pipe, and, the evening ceremonies being finished in

the village temple, sent for the village priest.



<P>Kim told the older children tales of the size and beauty of Lahore,

of railway travel, and such-like city things, while the men talked, slowly

as their cattle chew the cud.



<P>`I cannot fathom it,' said the headman at last to the priest. `How readest

thou this talk?' The lama, his tale told, was silently telling his beads.



<P>`He is a Seeker,' the priest answered. `The land is full of such. Remember

him who came only last month - the <I>fakir</I> with the tortoise?'



<P>`Ay, but that man had right and reason, for Krishna Himself appeared

in a vision promising him Paradise without the burning-pyre if he journeyed

to Prayag. This man seeks no God who is within my knowledge.'



<P>`Peace, he is old: he comes from far off, and he is mad,' the smooth-shaven

priest replied. `Hear me.' He turned to the lama. `Three <I>koss</I> [six

miles] to the westward runs the great road to Calcutta.'



<P>`But I would go to Benares - to Benares.'



<P>`And to Benares also. It crosses all streams on this side of Hind. Now

my word to thee, Holy One, is rest here till tomorrow. Then take the road'

(it was the Grand Trunk Road he meant) `and test each stream that it overpasses;

for, as I understand, the virtue of thy River lies neither in one pool

nor place, but throughout its length. Then, if thy Gods will, be assured

that thou wilt come upon thy freedom.'



<P>`That is well said.' The lama was much impressed by the plan. `We will

begin tomorrow, and a blessing on thee for showing old feet such a near

road.' A deep, sing-song Chinese half-chant dosed the sentence. Even the

priest was impressed, and the headman feared an evil spell: but none could

look at the lama's simple, eager face and doubt him long.



<P>`Seest thou my <I>chela</I>?' he said, diving into his snuff-gourd with

an important sniff. It was his duty to repay courtesy with courtesy.



<P>`I see - and hear.' The headman rolled his eye where Kim was chatting

to a girl in blue as she laid crackling thorns on a fire.



<P>`He also has a Search of his own. No river, but a Bull. Yea, a Red Bull

on a green field will some day raise him to honour. He, I think, not altogether

of this world. He was sent of a sudden to aid me in this search, and his

name is Friend of all the World.'



<P>The priest smiled. `Ho, there, Friend of all the World,' he cried across

the sharp-smelling smoke, `what art thou?'



<P>`This Holy One's disciple,' said Kim.



<P>`He says thou are a <I>b&amp;umacron;t</I><A HREF="notes.html">Note</A>

[a spirit].'



<P>`Can <I>b&amp;umacron;ts</I><A HREF="notes.html">Note</A> eat?' said

Kim, with a twinkle. `For I am hungry.'



<P>`It is no jest,' cried the lama. `A certain astrologer of that city

whose name I have forgotten - '



<P>`That is no more than the city of Umballa where we slept last night,'

Kim whispered to the priest.



<P>`Ay, Umballa was it? He cast a horoscope and declared that my <I>chela</I>

should find his desire within two days. But what said he of the meaning

of the stars, Friend of all the World?'



<P>Kim cleared his throat and looked around at the village greybeards.



<P>`The meaning of my Star is War,' he replied pompously.



<P>Somebody laughed at the little tattered figure strutting on the brickwork

plinth under the great tree. Where a native would have lain down, Kim's

white blood set him upon his feet.



<P>`Ay, War,' he answered.



<P>`That is a sure prophecy,' rumbled a deep voice. `For there is always

war along the Border - as I know.'



<P>It was an old, withered man, who had served the Government in the days

of the Mutiny as a native officer in a newly raised cavalry regiment. The

Government had given him a good holding in the village, and though the

demands of his sons, now grey-bearded officers on their own account, had

impoverished him, he was still a person of consequence. English officials

- Deputy Commissioners even - turned aside from the main road to visit

him, and on those occasions he dressed himself in the uniform of ancient

days, and stood up like a ramrod.



<P>`But this shall be a great war - a war of eight thousand.' Kim's voice

shrilled across the quick-gathering crowd, astonishing himself.



<P>`Redcoats or our own regiments?' the old man snapped, as though he were

asking an equal. His tone made men respect Kim.



<P>`Redcoats,' said Kim at a venture. `Redcoats and guns.'



<P>`But - but the astrologer said no word of this,' cried the lama, snuffing

prodigiously in his excitement.



<P>`But I know. The word has come to me, who am this Holy One's disciple.

There will rise a war - a war of eight thousand redcoats. From Pindi and

Peshawur they will be drawn. This is sure.'



<P>`The boy has heard bazar-talk,' said the priest.



<P>`But he was always by my side,' said the lama. `How should he know?

<I>I</I> did not know.'



<P>`He will make a clever juggler when the old man is dead,' muttered the

priest to the headman. `What new trick is this?'



<P>`A sign. Give me a sign,' thundered the old soldier suddenly. `If there

were war my sons would have told me.'



<P>`When all is ready, thy sons, doubt not, will be told. But it is a long

road from thy sons to the man in whose hands these things lie.' Kim warmed

to the game, for it reminded him of experiences in the letter-carrying

line, when, for the sake of a few pice, he pretended to know more than

he knew. But now he was playing for larger things - the sheer excitement

and the sense of power. He drew a new breath and went on.



<P>`Old man, give <I>me</I> a sign. Do underlings order the goings of eight

thousand redcoats - with guns?'



<P>`No.' Still the old man answered as though Kim were an equal.



<P>`Dost thou know who He is, then, that gives the order?'



<P>`I have seen Him.'



<P>`To know again?'



<P>`I have known Him since he was a lieutenant in the <I>topkhana</I> [the

Artillery].'



<P>`A tall man. A tall man with black hair, walking thus?' Kim took a few

paces in a stiff, wooden style.



<P>`Ay. But that anyone may have seen.' The crowd were breathless-still

through all this talk.



<P>`That is true,' said Kim. `But I will say more. Look now. First the

great man walks thus. Then He thinks thus.' (Kim drew a forefinger over

his forehead and downwards till it came to rest by the angle of the jaw.)

`Anon He twitches his fingers thus. Anon He thrusts his hat under his left

armpit.' Kim illustrated the motion and stood like a stork.



<P>The old man groaned, inarticulate with amazement; and the crowd shivered.



<P>`So - so - so. But what does He when He is about to give an order?'



<P>`He rubs the skin at the back of his neck - thus. Then falls one finger

on the table and He makes a small sniffing noise through his nose. Then

He speaks, saying: `Loose such and such a regiment. Call out such guns.''



<P>The old man rose stiffly and saluted.



<P>``For'' - Kim translated into the vernacular the clinching sentences

he had heard in the dressing-room at Umballa - ``For,' says He, `we should

have done this long ago. It is not war - it is a chastisement. Snff!''



<P>`Enough. I believe. I have seen Him thus in the smoke of battles. Seen

and heard. It is He!'



<P>`I saw no smoke' - Kim's voice shifted to the rapt sing-song of the

wayside fortune-teller. `I saw this in darkness. First came a man to make

things clear. Then came horsemen. Then came He, standing in a ring of light.

The rest followed as I have said. Old man, have I spoken truth?'



<P>`It is He. Past all doubt it is He.'



<P>The crowd drew a long, quavering breath, staring alternately at the

old man, still at attention, and ragged Kim against the purple twilight.



<P>`Said I not - said I not he was from the other world?' cried the lama

proudly. `He is the Friend of all the World. He is the Friend of the Stars!'



<P>`At least it does not concern us,' a man cried. `O thou young soothsayer,

if the gift abides with thee at all seasons, I have a red-spotted cow.

She may be sister to thy Bull for aught I know - '



<P>`Or I care,' said Kim. `My Stars do not concern themselves with thy

cattle.'



<P>`Nay, but she is very sick,' a woman struck in. `My man is a buffalo,

or he would have chosen his words better. Tell me if she recover?'



<P>Had Kim been at all an ordinary boy, he would have carried on the play;

but one does not know Lahore city, and least of all the <I>fakirs</I> by

the Taksali Gate, for thirteen years without also knowing human nature.



<P>The priest looked at him sideways, something bitterly - a dry and blighting

smile.



<P>`Is there no priest, then, in the village? I thought I had seen a great

one even now,' cried Kim.



<P>`Ay - but - ' the woman began.



<P>`But thou and thy husband hoped to get the cow cured for a handful of

thanks.' The shot told: they were notoriously the closest-fisted couple

in the village. `It is not well to cheat the temples. Give a young calf

to thine own priest, and, unless thy Gods are angry past recall, she will

give milk within a month.'



<P>`A master-beggar art thou,' purred the priest approvingly. `Not the

cunning of forty years could have done better. Surely thou hast made the

old man rich?'



<P>`A little flour, a little butter and a mouthful of cardamoms,' Kim retorted,

flushed with the praise, but still cautious - `Does one grow rich on that?

And, as thou canst see, he is mad. But it serves me while I learn the road

at least.'



<P>He knew what the <I>fakirs</I> of the Taksali Gate were like when they

talked among themselves, and copied the very inflection of their lewd disciples.



<P>`Is his Search, then, truth or a cloak to other ends? It may be treasure.'



<P>`He is mad - many times mad. There is nothing else.'



<P>Here the old soldier hobbled up and asked if Kim would accept his hospitality

for the night. The priest recommended him to do so, but insisted that the

honour of entertaining the lama belonged to the temple - at which the lama

smiled guilelessly. Kim glanced from one face to the other, and drew his

own conclusions.



<P>`Where is the money?' he whispered, beckoning the old man off into the

darkness.



<P>`In my bosom. Where else?'



<P>`Give it me. Quietly and swiftly give it me.'



<P>`But why? Here is no ticket to buy.'



<P>`Am I thy <I>chela</I>, or am I not? Do I not safeguard thy old feet

about the ways? Give me the money and at dawn I will return it.' He slipped

his hand above the lama's girdle and brought away the purse.



<P>`Be it so - be it so.' The old man nodded his head. `This is a great

and terrible world. I never knew there were so many men alive in it.'



<P>Next morning the priest was in a very bad temper, but the lama was quite

happy; and Kim had enjoyed a most interesting evening with the old man,

who brought out his cavalry sabre and, balancing it on his dry knees, told

tales of the Mutiny and young captains thirty years in their graves, till

Kim dropped off to sleep.



<P>`Certainly the air of this country is good,' said the lama. `I sleep

lightly, as do all old men; but last night I slept unwaking till broad

day. Even now I am heavy.'



<P>`Drink a draught of hot milk,' said Kim, who had carried not a few such

remedies to opium-smokers of his acquaintance. `It is time to take the

Road again.'



<P>`The long Road that overpasses all the rivers of Hind,' said the lama

gaily. `Let us go. But how thinkest thou, <I>chela</I>, to recompense these

people, and especially the priest, for their great kindness? Truly they

are <I>b&amp;umacron;t-parast</I><A HREF="notes.html">Note</A>, but in

other lives, maybe, they will receive enlightenment. A rupee to the temple?

The thing within is no more than stone and red paint, but the heart of

man we must acknowledge when and where it is good.'



<P>`Holy One, hast thou ever taken the Road alone?' Kim looked up sharply,

like the Indian crows so busy about the fields.



<P>`Surely, child: from Kulu to Path&icirc;nkot - from Kulu, where my first

<I>chela</I> died. When men were kind to us we made offerings, and all

men were well-disposed throughout all the Hills.'



<P>`It is otherwise in Hind,' said Kim drily. `Their Gods are many-armed

and malignant. Let them alone.'



<P>`I would set thee on thy road for a little, Friend of all the World

- thou and thy yellow man.' The old soldier ambled up the village street,

all shadowy in the dawn, on a gaunt, scissor-hocked pony. `Last night broke

up the fountains of remembrance in my so-dried heart, and it was as a blessing

to me. Truly there is war abroad in the air. I smell it. See! I have brought

my sword.'



<P>He sat long-legged on the little beast, with the big sword at his side

- hand dropped on the pommel - staring fiercely over the flat lands towards

the North. `Tell me again how He showed in thy vision. Come up and sit

behind me. The beast will carry two.'



<P>`I am this Holy One's disciple,' said Kim, as they cleared the village-gate.

The villagers seemed almost sorry to be rid of them, but the priest's farewell

was cold and distant. He had wasted some opium on a man who carried no

money.



<P>`That is well spoken. I am not much used to holy men, but respect is

always good. There is no respect in these days - not even when a Commissioner

Sahib comes to see me. But why should one whose Star leads him to war follow

a holy man?'



<P>`But he <I>is</I> a holy man,' said Kim earnestly. `In truth, and in

talk and in act, holy. He is not like the others. I have never seen such

an one. We be not fortune-tellers, or jugglers, or beggars.'



<P>`<I>Thou</I> art not. That I can see. But I do not know that other.

He marches well, though.'



<P>The first freshness of the day carried the lama forward with long, easy,

camel-like strides. He was deep in meditation, mechanically clicking his

rosary.



<P>They followed the rutted and worn country road that wound across the

flat between the great dark-green mango-groves, the line of the snow-capped

Himalayas faint to the eastward. All India was at work in the fields, to

the creaking of well-wheels, the shouting of ploughmen behind their cattle,

and the clamour of the crows. Even the pony felt the good influence and

almost broke into a trot as Kim laid a hand on the stirrup-leather.



<P>`It repents me that I did not give a rupee to the shrine,' said the

lama on the last bead of his eighty-one.



<P>The old soldier growled in his beard, so that the lama for the first

time was aware of him.



<P>`Seekest thou the River also?' said he, turning.



<P>`The day is new,' was the reply. `What need of a river save to water

at before sundown? I come to show thee a short lane to the Big Road.'



<P>`That is a courtesy to be remembered, O man of good will. But why the

sword?'



<P>The old soldier looked as abashed as a child interrupted in his game

of make-believe.



<P>`The sword,' he said, fumbling it. `Oh, that was a fancy of mine - an

old man's fancy. Truly the police orders are that no man must bear weapons

throughout Hind, but' - he cheered up and slapped the hilt - `all the constabeels

hereabout know me.'



<P>`It is not a good fancy,' said the lama. `What profit to kill men?'



<P>`Very little - as I know; but if evil men were not now and then slain

it would not be a good world for weaponless dreamers. I do not speak without

knowledge who have seen the land from Delhi south awash with blood.'



<P>`What madness was that, then?'



<P>`The Gods, who sent it for a plague, alone know. A madness ate into

all the Army, and they turned against their officers. That was the first

evil, but not past remedy if they had then held their hands. But they chose

to kill the Sahibs' wives and children. Then came the Sahibs from over

the sea and called them to most strict account.'



<P>`Some such rumour, I believe, reached me once long ago. They called

it the Black Year, as I remember.'



<P>`What manner of life hast thou led, not to know The Year? A rumour indeed!

All earth knew, and trembled!'



<P>`Our earth never shook but once - upon the day that the Excellent One

received Enlightenment.'



<P>`Umph! I saw Delhi shake at least; and Delhi is the navel of the world.'



<P>`So they turned against women and children? That was a bad deed, for

which the punishment cannot be avoided.'



<P>`Many strove to do so, but with very small profit. I was then in a regiment

of cavalry. It broke. Of six hundred and eighty sabres stood fast to their

salt - how many, think you? Three. Of whom I was one.'



<P>`The greater merit.'



<P>`Merit! We did not consider it merit in those days. My people, my friends,

my brothers fell from me. They said: `The time of the English is accomplished.

Let each strike out a little holding for himself.' But I had talked with

the men of Sobraon, of Chilianwallah, of Moodkee and Ferozeshah. I said:

`Abide a little and the wind turns. There is no blessing in this work.'

In those days I rode seventy miles with an English Memsahib and her babe

on my saddle-bow. (Wow! That was a horse fit for a man!) I placed them

in safety, and back came I to my officer - the one that was not killed

of our five. `Give me work,' said I, `for I am an outcast among my own

kind, and my cousin's blood is wet on my sabre.' `Be content,' said he.

`There is great work forward. When this madness is over there is a recompense.''



<P>`Ay, there is a recompense when the madness is over, surely?' the lama

muttered half to himself.



<P>`They did not hang medals in those days on all who by accident had heard

a gun fired. No! In nineteen pitched battles was I; in six-and-forty skirmishes

of horse; and in small affairs without number. Nine wounds I bear; a medal

and four clasps and the medal of an Order, for my captains, who are now

generals, remembered me when the Kaisar-i-Hind had accomplished fifty years

of her reign, and all the land rejoiced. They said: `Give him the Order

of Berittish India.' I carry it upon my neck now. I have also my <I>jaghir</I>

[holding] from the hands of the State - a free gift to me and mine. The

men of the old days - they are now Commissioners - come riding to me through

the crops - high upon horses so that all the village sees - and we talk

out the old skirmishes, one dead man's name leading to another.'



<P>`And after?' said the lama.



<P>`Oh, afterwards they go away, but not before my village has seen.'



<P>`And at the last what wilt thou do?'



<P>`At the last I shall die.'



<P>`And after?'



<P>`Let the Gods order it. I have never pestered Them with prayers. I do

not think They will pester me. Look you, I have noticed in my long life

that those who eternally break in upon Those Above with complaints and

reports and bellowings and weepings are presently sent for in haste, as

our Colonel used to send for slack-jawed down-country men who talked too

much. No, I have never wearied the Gods. They will remember this, and give

me a quiet place where I can drive my lance in the shade, and wait to welcome

my sons: I have no less than three - Rissaldar-majors all - in the regiments.'



<P>`And they likewise, bound upon the Wheel, go forth from life to life

- from despair to despair,' said the lama below his breath, `hot, uneasy,

snatching.'



<P>`Ay,' the old soldier chuckled. `Three Rissaldar-majors in three regiments.

Gamblers a little, but so am I. They must be well mounted; and one cannot

take the horses as in the old days one took women. Well, well, my holding

can pay for all. How thinkest thou? It is a well-watered strip, but my

men cheat me. I do not know how to ask save at the lance's point. Ugh!

I grow angry and I curse them, and they feign penitence, but behind my

back I know they call me a toothless old ape.'



<P>`Hast thou never desired any other thing?'



<P>`Yes - yes - a thousand times! A straight back and a close-clinging

knee once more; a quick wrist and a keen eye; and the marrow that makes

a man. Oh, the old days - the good days of my strength!'



<P>`That strength is weakness.'



<P>`It has turned so; but fifty years since I could have proved it otherwise,'

the old soldier retorted, driving his stirrup-edge into the pony's lean

flank.



<P>`But I know a River of great healing.'



<P>`I have drank Gunga-water to the edge of dropsy. All she gave me was

a flux, and no sort of strength.'



<P>`It is not Gunga. The River that I know washes from all taint of sin.

Ascending the far bank one is assured of Freedom. I do not know thy life,

but thy face is the face of the honourable and courteous. Thou hast clung

to thy Way, rendering fidelity when it was hard to give, in that Black

Year of which I now remember other tales. Enter now upon the Middle Way

which is the path to Freedom. Hear the Most Excellent Law, and do not follow

dreams.'



<P>`Speak, then, old man,' the soldier smiled, half saluting. `We be all

babblers at our age.'



<P>The lama squatted under the shade of a mango, whose shadow played checkerwise

over his face; the soldier sat stiffly on the pony; and Kim, making sure

that there were no snakes, lay down in the crotch of the twisted roots.



<P>There was a drowsy buzz of small life in hot sunshine, a cooing of doves,

and a sleepy drone of well-wheels across the fields. Slowly and impressively

the lama began. At the end often minutes the old soldier slid from his

pony, to hear better as he said, and sat with the reins round his wrist.

The lama's voice faltered - the periods lengthened. Kim was busy watching

a grey squirrel. When the little scolding bunch of fur, close pressed to

the branch, disappeared, preacher and audience were fast asleep, the old

officer's strong-cut head pillowed on his arm, the lama's thrown back against

the tree-bole, where it showed like yellow ivory. A naked child toddled

up, stared, and, moved by some quick impulse of reverence, made a solemn

little obeisance before the lama - only the child was so short and fat

that it toppled over sideways, and Kim laughed at the sprawling, chubby

legs. The child, scared and indignant, yelled aloud.



<P>`Hai! Hai!' said the soldier, leaping to his feet. `What is it? What

orders?... It is... a child! I dreamed it was an alarm. Little one - little

one - do not cry. Have I slept? That was discourteous indeed!'



<P>`I fear! I am afraid!' roared the child.



<P>`What is it to fear? Two old men and a boy? How wilt thou ever make

a soldier, Princeling?'



<P>The lama had waked too, but, taking no direct notice of the child, clicked

his rosary.



<P>`What is that?' said the child, stopping a yell midway. `I have never

seen such things. Give them me.'



<P>`Aha,' said the lama, smiling, and trailing a loop of it on the grass:

<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>This is a handful of cardamoms,

<BR>This is a lump of <I>ghi</I>:

<BR>This is millet and chillies and rice,

<BR>A supper for thee and me!</BLOCKQUOTE>

The child shrieked with joy, and snatched at the dark, glancing beads.



<P>`Oho!' said the old soldier. `Whence hadst thou that song, despiser

of this world?'



<P>`I learned it in Path&icirc;nkot - sitting on a doorstep,' said the

lama shyly. `It is good to be kind to babes.'



<P>`As I remember, before the sleep came on us, thou hadst told me that

marriage and bearing were darkeners of the true light, stumbling-blocks

upon the Way. Do children drop from Heaven in thy country? Is it the Way

to sing them songs?'



<P>`No man is all perfect,' said the lama gravely, recoiling the rosary.

`Run now to thy mother, little one.'



<P>`Hear him!' said the soldier to Kim. `He is ashamed for that he has

made a child happy. There was a very good householder lost in thee, my

brother. Hai, child!' He threw it a pice. `Sweetmeats are always sweet.

And as the little figure capered away into the sunshine: `They grow up

and become men. Holy One, I grieve that I slept in the midst of thy preaching.

Forgive me.'



<P>`We be two old men,' said the lama. `The fault is mine. I listened to

thy talk of the world and its madness, and one fault led to the next.'



<P>`Hear him! What harm do thy Gods suffer from play with a babe? And that

song was very well sung. Let us go on and I will sing thee the song of

Nikal Seyn before Delhi - the old song.'



<P>And they fared out from the gloom of the mango tope, the old man's high,

shrill voice ringing across the field, as wail by long-drawn wail he unfolded

the story of Nikal Seyn [Nicholson] - the song that men sing in the Punjab

to this day. Kim was delighted, and the lama listened with deep interest.



<P>`Ahi! Nikal Seyn is dead - he died before Delhi! Lances of the North,

take vengeance for Nikal Seyn.' He quavered it out to the end, marking

the trills with the flat of his sword on the pony's rump.



<P>`And now we come to the Big Road,' said he, after receiving the compliments

of Kim; for the lama was markedly silent. `It is long since I have ridden

this way, but thy boy's talk stirred me. See, Holy One - the Great Road

which is the backbone of all Hind. For the most part it is shaded, as here,

with four lines of trees; the middle road - all hard - takes the quick

traffic. In the days before rail-carriages the Sahibs travelled up and

down here in hundreds. Now there are only country-carts and such like.

Left and right is the rougher road for the heavy carts - grain and cotton

and timber, fodder, lime and hides. A man goes in safety here - for at

every few <I>koss</I> is a police-station. The police are thieves and extortioners

(I myself would patrol it with cavalry - young recruits under a strong

captain), but at least they do not suffer any rivals. All castes and kinds

of men move here. Look! Brahmins and <I>chumars</I>, bankers and tinkers,

barbers and <I>bunnias</I>, pilgrims and potters - all the world going

and coming. It is to me as a river from which I am withdrawn like a log

after a flood.'



<P>And truly the Grand Trunk Road is a wonderful spectacle. It runs straight,

bearing without crowding India's traffic for fifteen hundred miles - such

a river of life as nowhere else exists in the world. They looked at the

green-arched, shade-flecked length of it, the white breadth speckled with

slow-pacing folk; and the two-roomed police-station opposite.



<P>`Who-bears arms against the law?' a constable called out laughingly,

as he caught sight of the soldier's sword. `Are not the police enough to

destroy evil-doers?'



<P>`It was because of the police I bought it,' was the answer. `Does all

go well in Hind?'



<P>`Rissaldar Sahib, all goes well.'



<P>`I am like an old tortoise, look you, who puts his head out from the

bank and draws it in again. Ay, this is the Road of Hindustan. All men

come by this way... '



<P>`Son of a swine, is the soft part of the road meant for thee to scratch

thy back upon? Father of all the daughters of shame and husband of ten

thousand virtueless ones, thy mother was devoted to a devil, being led

thereto by her mother. Thy aunts have never had a nose for seven generations!

Thy sister - What owl's folly told thee to draw thy carts across the road?

A broken wheel? Then take a broken head and put the two together at leisure!'



<P>The voice and a venomous whip-cracking came out of a pillar of dust

fifty yards away, where a cart had broken down. A thin, high Kathiawar

mare, with eyes and nostrils aflame, rocketed out of the jam, snorting

and wincing as her rider bent her across the road in chase of a shouting

man. He was tall and grey-bearded, sitting the almost mad beast as a piece

of her, and scientifically lashing his victim between plunges.



<P>The old man's face lit with pride. `My child!' said he briefly, and

strove to rein the pony's neck to a fitting arch.



<P>`Am I to be beaten before the police?' cried the carter. `Justice! I

will have Justice - '



<P>`Am I to be blocked by a shouting ape who upsets ten thousand sacks

under a young horse's nose? That is the way to ruin a mare.'



<P>`He speaks truth. He speaks truth. But she follows her man close,' said

the old man. The carter ran under the wheels of his cart and thence threatened

all sorts of vengeance.



<P>`They are strong men, thy sons,' said the policeman serenely, picking

his teeth.



<P>The horseman delivered one last vicious cut with his whip and came on

at a canter.



<P>`My father!' He reigned back ten yards and dismounted.



<P>The old man was off his pony in an instant, and they embraced as do

father and son in the East.

They entered the fort-like railway station, black in the end of night;

the electrics sizzling over the goods-yard where they handle the heavy

Northern grain-traffic.



<P>`This is the work of devils!' said the lama, recoiling from the hollow

echoing darkness, the glimmer of rails between the masonry platforms, and

the maze of girders above. He stood in a gigantic stone hall paved, it

seemed, with the sheeted dead - third-class passengers who had taken their

tickets overnight and were sleeping in the waiting-rooms. All hours of

the twenty-four are alike to Orientals, and their passenger traffic is

regulated accordingly.



<P>`This is where the fire-carriages come. One stands behind that hole'

- Kim pointed to the ticket-office - `who will give thee a paper to take

thee to Umballa.'



<P>`But we go to Benares,' he replied petulantly.



<P>`All one. Benares then. Quick: she comes!'



<P>`Take thou the purse.'



<P>The lama, not so well used to trains as he had pretended, started as

the 3.25 a.m. south-bound roared in. The sleepers sprang to life, and the

station filled with clamour and shoutings, cries of water and sweetmeat

vendors, shouts of native policemen, and shrill yells of women gathering

up their baskets, their families, and their husbands.



<P>`It is the train - only the <I>te-rain</I>. It will not come here. Wait!'



<P>Amazed at the lama's immense simplicity (he had handed him a small bag

full of rupees), Kim asked and paid for a ticket to Umballa. A sleepy clerk

grunted and flung out a ticket to the next station, just six miles distant.



<P>`Nay,' said Kim, scanning it with a grin. `This may serve for farmers,

but I live in the city of Lahore. It was cleverly done, Babu. Now give

the ticket to Umballa.'



<P>The Babu scowled and dealt the proper ticket.



<P>`Now another to Amritzar,' said Kim, who had no notion of spending Mahbub

Ali's money on anything so crude as a paid ride to Umballa. `The price

is so much. The small money in return is just so much. I know the ways

of the <I>te-rain</I>... Never did <I>yogi</I> need <I>chela</I> as thou

dost,' he went on merrily to the bewildered lama. `They would have flung

thee out at Mian Mir but for me. This way! Come!' He returned the money,

keeping only one anna in each rupee of the price of the Umballa ticket

as his commission - the immemorial commission of Asia.



<P>The lama jibbed at the open door of a crowded third-class carriage.

`Were it not better to walk?' said he weakly.



<P>A burly Sikh artisan thrust forth his bearded head. `Is he afraid? Do

not be afraid. I remember the time when I was afraid of the <I>te-rain</I>.

Enter! This thing is the work of the Government.'



<P>`I do not fear,' said the lama. `Have ye room within for two?'



<P>`There is no room even for a mouse,' shrilled the wife of a well-to-do

cultivator - a Hindu Jat from the rich Jullundur district. Our night trains

are not as well looked after as the day ones, where the sexes are very

strictly kept to separate carriages.



<P>`Oh, mother of my son, we can make space,' said the blue-turbaned husband.

`Pick up the child. It is a holy man, see'st thou?'



<P>`And my lap full of seventy times seven bundles! Why not bid him sit

on my knee, Shameless? But men are ever thus!' She looked round for approval.

An Amritzar courtesan near the window sniffed behind her head drapery.



<P>`Enter! Enter!' cried a fat Hindu money-lender, his folded account-book

in a cloth under his arm. With an oily smirk: `It is well to be kind to

the poor.'



<P>`Ay, at seven per cent a month with a mortgage on the unborn calf,'

said a young Dogra soldier going south on leave; and they all laughed.



<P>`Will it travel to Benares?' said the lama.



<P>`Assuredly. Else why should we come? Enter, or we are left,' cried Kim.



<P>`See!' shrilled the Amritzar girl. `He has never entered a train. Oh,

see!'



<P>`Nay, help,' said the cultivator, putting out a large brown hand and

hauling him in. `Thus is it done, father.'



<P>`But - but - I sit on the floor. It is against the Rule to sit on a

bench,' said the lama. `Moreover, it cramps me.'



<P>`I say,' began the money-lender, pursing his lips, `that there is not

one rule of right living which these <I>te-rains</I> do not cause us to

break. We sit, for example, side by side with all castes and peoples.'



<P>`Yea, and with most outrageously shameless ones,' said the wife, scowling

at the Amritzar girl making eyes at the young sepoy.



<P>`I said we might have gone by cart along the road,' said the husband,

`and thus have saved some money.'



<P>`Yes - and spent twice over what we saved on food by the way. That was

talked out ten thousand times.'



<P>`Ay, by ten thousand tongues,' grunted he.



<P>`The Gods help us poor women if we may not speak. Oho! He is of that

sort which may not look at or reply to a woman.' For the lama, constrained

by his Rule, took not the faintest notice of her. `And his disciple is

like him?'



<P>`Nay, mother,' said Kim most promptly. `Not when the woman is well-looking

and above all charitable to the hungry.'



<P>`A beggar's answer,' said the Sikh, laughing. `Thou hast brought it

on thyself, sister!' Kim's hands were crooked in supplication.



<P>`And whither goest thou?' said the woman, handing him the half of a

cake from a greasy package.



<P>`Even to Benares.'



<P>`Jugglers belike?' the young soldier suggested. `Have ye any tricks

to pass the time? Why does not that yellow man answer?'



<P>`Because,' said Kim stoutly, `he is holy, and thinks upon matters hidden

from thee.'



<P>`That may be well. We of the Ludhiana Sikhs' - he rolled it out sonorously

- `do not trouble our heads with doctrine. We fight.'



<P>`My sister's brother's son is <I>naik</I> [corporal] in that regiment,'

said the Sikh craftsman quietly. `There are also some Dogra companies there.'

The soldier glared, for a Dogra is of other caste than a Sikh, and the

banker tittered.



<P>`They are all one to me,' said the Amritzar girl.



<P>`That we believe,' snorted the cultivator's wife malignantly.



<P>`Nay, but all who serve the Sirkar with weapons in their hands are,

as it were, one brotherhood. There is one brotherhood of the caste, but

beyond that again' - she looked round timidly - `the bond of the <I>Pulton</I>

- the Regiment - eh?'



<P>`My brother is in a Jat regiment,' said the cultivator. `Dogras be good

men.'



<P>`<I>Thy</I> Sikhs at least were of that opinion,' said the soldier,

with a scowl at the placid old man in the corner. `<I>Thy</I> Sikhs thought

so when our two companies came to help them at the Pirzai Kotal in the

face of eight Afridi standards on the ridge not three months gone.'



<P>He told the story of a Border action in which the Dogra companies of

the Ludhiana Sikhs had acquitted themselves well. The Amritzar girl smiled;

for she knew the tale was to win her approval.



<P>`Alas!' said the cultivator's wife at the end. `So their villages were

burnt and their little children made homeless?'



<P>`They had marked our dead. They paid a great payment after we of the

Sikhs had schooled them. So it was. Is this Amritzar?'



<P>`Ay, and here they cut our tickets,' said the banker, fumbling at his

belt.



<P>The lamps were paling in the dawn when the half-caste guard came round.

Ticket-collecting is a slow business in the East, where people secrete

their tickets in all sorts of curious places. Kim produced his and was

told to get out.



<P>`But I go to Umballa,' he protested. `I go with this holy man.'



<P>`Thou canst go to Jehannum for aught I care. This ticket is only to

Amritzar. Out!'



<P>Kim burst into a flood of tears, protesting that the lama was his father

and his mother, that he was the prop of the lama's declining years, and

that the lama would die without his care. All the carriage bade the guard

be merciful - the banker was specially eloquent here - but the guard hauled

Kim on to the platform. The lama blinked - he could not overtake the situation

- and Kim lifted up his voice and wept outside the carriage window.



<P>`I am very poor. My father is dead - my mother is dead. O charitable

ones, if I am left here, who shall tend that old man?'



<P>`What - what is this?' the lama repeated. `He must go to Benares. He

must come with me. He is my <I>chela</I>. If there is money to be paid

- '



<P>`Oh, be silent,' whispered Kim; `are we Rajahs to throw away good silver

when the world is so charitable?'



<P>The Amritzar girl stepped out with her bundles, and it was on her that

Kim kept his watchful eye. Ladies of that persuasion, he knew, were generous.



<P>`A ticket - a little <I>tikkut</I> to Umballa - O Breaker of Hearts!'

She laughed. `Hast thou no charity?'



<P>`Does the holy man come from the North'



<P>`From far and far in the North he comes,' cried Kim. `From among the

hills.'



<P>`There is snow among the pine-trees in the North - in the hills there

is snow. My mother was from Kulu. Get thee a ticket. Ask him for a blessing.'



<P>`Ten thousand blessings,' shrilled Kim. `O Holy One, a woman has given

us in charity so that I can come with thee - a woman with a golden heart.

I run for the <I>tikkut</I>.'



<P>The girl looked up at the lama, who had mechanically followed Kim to

the platform. He bowed his head that he might not see her, and muttered

in Tibetan as she passed on with the crowd.



<P>`Light come - light go,' said the cultivator's wife viciously.



<P>`She has acquired merit,' returned the lama. `Beyond doubt it was a

nun.'



<P>`There be ten thousand such nuns in Amritzar alone. Return, old man,

or the <I>te-rain</I> may depart without thee,' cried the banker.



<P>`Not only was it sufficient for the ticket, but for a little food also,'

said Kim, leaping to his place. `Now eat, Holy One. Look. Day comes!'



<P>Golden, rose, saffron, and pink, the morning mists smoked away across

the flat green levels. All the rich Punjab lay out in the splendour of

the keen sun. The lama flinched a little as the telegraph-posts swung by.



<P>`Great is the speed of the <I>te-rain</I>,' said the banker, with a

patronizing grin. `We have gone farther since Lahore than thou couldst

walk in two days: at even, we shall enter Umballa.'



<P>`And that is still far from Benares,' said the lama wearily, mumbling

over the cakes that Kim offered. They all unloosed their bundles and made

their morning meal. Then the banker, the cultivator, and the soldier prepared

their pipes and wrapped the compartment in choking, acrid smoke, spitting

and coughing and enjoying themselves. The Sikh and the cultivator's wife

chewed <I>pan</I>; the lama took snuff and told his beads, while Kim, cross-legged,

smiled over the comfort of a full stomach.



<P>`What rivers have ye by Benares?' said the lama of a sudden to the carriage

at large.



<P>`We have Gunga,' returned the banker, when the little titter had subsided.



<P>`What others?'



<P>`What other than Gunga?'



<P>`Nay, but in my mind was the thought of a certain River of healing.'



<P>`That is Gunga. Who bathes in her is made clean and goes to the Gods.

Thrice have I made pilgrimage to Gunga.' He looked round proudly.



<P>`There was need,' said the young sepoy drily, and the travellers' laugh

turned against the banker.



<P>`Clean - to return again to the Gods,' the lama muttered. `And to go

forth on the round of lives anew - still tied to the Wheel.' He shook his

head testily. `But maybe there is a mistake. Who, then, made Gunga in the

beginning?'



<P>`The Gods. Of what known faith art thou?' the banker said, appalled.



<P>`I follow the Law - the Most Excellent Law. So it was the Gods that

made Gunga. What like of Gods were they?'



<P>The carriage looked at him in amazement. It was inconceivable that anyone

should be ignorant of Gunga.



<P>`What - what is thy God?' said the money-lender at last.



<P>`Hear!' said the lama, shifting the rosary to his hand. `Hear: for I

speak of Him now! O people of Hind, listen!'



<P>He began in Urdu the tale of the Lord Buddha, but, borne by his own

thoughts, slid into Tibetan and long-droned texts from a Chinese book of

the Buddha's life. The gentle, tolerant folk looked on reverently. All

India is full of holy men stammering gospels in strange tongues; shaken

and consumed in the fires of their own zeal; dreamers, babblers, and visionaries:

as it has been from the beginning and will continue to the end.



<P>`Um!' said the soldier of the Ludhiana Sikhs. `There was a Mohammedan

regiment lay next to us at the Pirzai Kotal, and a priest of theirs - he

was, as I remember, a <I>naik</I> - when the fit was on him, spake prophecies.

But the mad all are in God's keeping. His officers overlooked much in that

man.'



<P>The lama fell back on Urdu, remembering that he was in a strange land.

`Hear the tale of the Arrow which our Lord loosed from the bow,' he said.



<P>This was much more to their taste, and they listened curiously while

he told it. `Now, O people of Hind, I go to seek that River. Know ye aught

that may guide me, for we be all men and women in evil case.'



<P>`There is Gunga - and Gunga alone - who washes away sin,' ran the murmur

round the carriage.



<P>`Though past question we have good Gods Jullundur-way,' said the cultivator's

wife, looking out of the window. `See how they have blessed the crops.'



<P>`To search every river in the Punjab is no small matter,' said her husband.

`For me, a stream that leaves good silt on my land suffices, and I thank

Bhumia, the God of the Home-stead.' He shrugged one knotted, bronzed shoulder.



<P>`Think you our Lord came so far North?' said the lama, turning to Kim.



<P>`It may be,' Kim replied soothingly, as he spat red pan-juice on the

floor.



<P>`The last of the Great Ones,' said the Sikh with authority, `was Sikander

Julkarn [Alexander the Great]. He paved the streets of Jullundur and built

a great tank near Umballa. That pavement holds to this day; and the tank

is there also. I never heard of thy God.'



<P>`Let thy hair grow long and talk Punjabi,' said the young soldier jestingly

to Kim, quoting a Northern proverb. `That is all that makes a Sikh.' But

he did not say this very loud.



<P>The lama sighed and shrank into himself, a dingy, shapeless mass. In

the pauses of their talk they could hear the low droning - `<I>Om mane

pudme hum! Om mane pudme hum</I>!' - and the thick click of the wooden

rosary beads.



<P>`It irks me,' he said at last. `The speed and the clatter irk me. Moreover,

my <I>chela</I>, I think that maybe we have over-passed that River.'



<P>`Peace, peace,' said Kim. `Was not the River near Benares? We are yet

far from the place.'



<P>`But - if our Lord came North, it may be any one of these little ones

that we have run across.'



<P>`I do not know.'



<P>`But thou wast sent to me - wast thou sent to me? - for the merit I

had acquired over yonder at Such-zen. From beside the cannon didst thou

come - bearing two faces - and two garbs.'



<P>`Peace. One must not speak of these things here,' whispered Kim. `There

was but one of me. Think again and thou wilt remember. A boy - a Hindu

boy - by the great green cannon.'



<P>`But was there not also an Englishman with a white beard holy among

images - who himself made more sure my assurance of the River of the Arrow?'



<P>`He - we - went to the Ajaib-Gher in Lahore to pray before the Gods

there,' Kim explained to the openly listening company. `And the Sahib of

the Wonder House talked to him - yes, this is truth - as a brother. He

is a very holy man, from far beyond the Hills. Rest, thou. In time we come

to Umballa.'



<P>`But my River - the River of my healing?'



<P>`And then, if it please thee, we will go hunting for that River on foot.

So that we miss nothing - not even a little rivulet in a field-side.'



<P>`But thou hast a Search of thine own?' The lama - very pleased that

he remembered so well - sat bolt upright.



<P>`Ay,' said Kim, humouring him. The boy was entirely happy to be out

chewing <I>pan</I> and seeing new people in the great good-tempered world.



<P>`It was a bull - a Red Bull that shall come and help thee - and carry

thee - whither? I have forgotten. A Red Bull on a green field, was it not?'



<P>`Nay, it will carry me nowhere,' said Kim. `It is but a tale I told

thee.'



<P>`What is this?' The cultivator's wife leaned forward, her bracelets

clinking on her arm. `Do ye both dream dreams? A Red Bull on a green field,

that shall carry thee to the heavens - or what? Was it a vision? Did one

make a prophecy? <I>We</I> have a Red Bull in our village behind Jullundur

city, and he grazes by choice in the very greenest of our fields!'



<P>`Give a woman an old wife's tale and a weaver-bird a leaf and a thread,

they will weave wonderful things,' said the Sikh. `All holy men dream dreams,

and by following holy men their disciples attain that power.



<P>`A Red Bull on a green field, was it?' the lama repeated. `In a former

life it may be thou hast acquired merit, and the Bull will come to reward

thee.'



<P>`Nay - nay - it was but a tale one told to me - for a jest belike. But

I will seek the Bull about Umballa, and thou canst look for thy River and

rest from the clatter of the train.'



<P>`It may be that the Bull knows - that he is sent to guide us both,'

said the lama, hopefully as a child. Then to the company, indicating Kim:

`This one was sent to me but yesterday. He is not, I think, of this world.'



<P>`Beggars aplenty have I met, and holy men to boot, but never such a

<I>yogi</I> nor such a disciple,' said the woman.



<P>Her husband touched his forehead lightly with one finger and smiled.

But the next time the lama would eat they took care to give him of their

best.



<P>And at last - tired, sleepy, and dusty - they reached Umballa City Station.



<P>`We abide here upon a law-suit,' said the cultivator's wife to Kim.

`We lodge with my man's cousin's younger brother. There is room also in

the courtyard for thy <I>yogi</I> and for thee. Will - will he give me

a blessing?'



<P>`O holy man! A woman with a heart of gold gives us lodging for the night.

It is a kindly land, this land of the South. See how we have been helped

since the dawn!'



<P>The lama bowed his head in benediction.



<P>`To fill my cousin's younger brother's house with wastrels - ' the husband

began, as he shouldered his heavy bamboo staff.



<P>`Thy cousin's younger brother owes my father's cousin something yet

on his daughter's marriage-feast,' said the woman crisply. `Let him put

their food to that account. The <I>yogi</I> will beg, I doubt not.'



<P>`Ay, I beg for him,' said Kim, anxious only to get the lama under shelter

for the night, that he might seek Mahbub Ali's Englishman and deliver himself

of the white stallion's pedigree.



<P>`Now,' said he, when the lama had come to an anchor in the inner courtyard

of a decent Hindu house behind the cantonments, `I go away for a while

- to - to buy us victual in the bazar. Do not stray abroad till I return.'



<P>`Thou wilt return? Thou wilt surely return?' The old man caught at his

wrist. `And thou wilt return in this very same shape? Is it too late to

look tonight for the River?'



<P>`Too late and too dark. Be comforted. Think how far thou art on the

road - an hundred miles from Lahore already.'



<P>`Yea - and farther from my monastery. Alas! It is a great and terrible

world.'



<P>Kim stole out and away, as unremarkable a figure as ever carried his

own and a few score thousand other folk's fate slung round his neck. Mahbub

Ali's directions left him little doubt of the house in which his Englishman

lived; and a groom, bringing a dog-cart home from the Club, made him quite

sure. It remained only to identify his man, and Kim slipped through the

garden hedge and hid in a clump of plumed grass close to the veranda. The

house blazed with lights, and servants moved about tables dressed with

flowers, glass, and silver. Presently forth came an Englishman, dressed

in black and white, humming a tune. It was too dark to see his face, so

Kim, beggar-wise, tried an old experiment.



<P>`Protector of the Poor!'



<P>The man backed towards the voice.



<P>`Mahbub Ali says - '



<P>`Hah! What says Mahbub Ali?' He made no attempt to look for the speaker,

and that showed Kim that he knew.



<P>`The pedigree of the white stallion is fully established.'



<P>`What proof is there?' The Englishman switched at the rose-hedge in

the side of the drive.



<P>`Mahbub Ali has given me this proof.' Kim flipped the wad of folded

paper into the air, and it fell in the path beside the man, who put his

foot on it as a gardener came round the corner. When the servant passed

he picked it up, dropped a rupee - Kim could hear the clink - and strode

into the house, never turning round. Swiftly Kim took up the money; but

for all his training, he was Irish enough by birth to reckon silver the

least part of any game. What he desired was the visible effect of action;

so, instead of slinking away, he lay close in the grass and wormed nearer

to the house.



<P>He saw - Indian bungalows are open through and through - the Englishman

return to a small dressing-room, in a corner of the veranda, that was half

office, littered with papers and despatch-boxes, and sit down to study

Mahbub Ali's message. His face, by the full ray of the kerosene lamp, changed

and darkened, and Kim, used as every beggar must be to watching countenances,

took good note.



<P>`Will! Will, dear!' called a woman's voice. `You ought to be in the

drawing-room. They'll be here in a minute.'



<P>The man still read intently.



<P>`Will!' said the voice, five minutes later. `<I>He's</I> come. I can

hear the troopers in the drive.'



<P>The man dashed out bareheaded as a big landau with four native troopers

behind it halted at the veranda, and a tall, black-haired man, erect as

an arrow, swung out, preceded by a young officer who laughed pleasantly.



<P>Flat on his belly lay Kim, almost touching the high wheels. His man

and the black stranger exchanged two sentences.



<P>`Certainly, sir,' said the young officer promptly. `Everything waits

while a horse is concerned.'



<P>`We shan't be more than twenty minutes,' said Kim's man. `You can do

the honours - keep 'em amused, and all that.'



<P>`Tell one of the troopers to wait,' said the tall man, and they both

passed into the dressing-room together as the landau rolled away. Kim saw

their heads bent over Mahbub Ali's message, and heard the voices - one

low and deferential, the other sharp and decisive.



<P>`It isn't a question of weeks. It is a question of days - hours almost,'

said the elder. `I'd been expecting it for some time, but this' - he tapped

Mahbub Ali's paper - `clinches it. Grogan's dining here tonight, isn't

he?'



<P>`Yes, sir, and Macklin too.'



<P>`Very good. I'll speak to them myself. The matter will be referred to

the Council, of course, but this is a case where one is justified in assuming

that we take action at once. Warn the Pindi and Peshawur brigades. It will

disorganize all the summer reliefs, but we can't help that. This comes

of not smashing them thoroughly the first time. Eight thousand should be

enough.'



<P>`What about artillery, sir?'



<P>`I must consult Macklin.'



<P>`Then it means war?'



<P>`No. Punishment. When a man is bound by the action of his predecessor

- '



<P>`But C25 may have lied.'



<P>`He bears out the other's information. Practically, they showed their

hand six months back. But Devenish would have it there was a chance of

peace. Of course they used it to make themselves stronger. Send off those

telegrams at once - the new code, not the old - mine and Wharton's. I don't

think we need keep the ladies waiting any longer. We can settle the rest

over the cigars. I thought it was coming. It's punishment - not war.'



<P>As the trooper cantered off, Kim crawled round to the back of the house,

where, going on his Lahore experiences, he judged there would be food -

and information. The kitchen was crowded with excited scullions, one of

whom kicked him.



<P>`Aie,' said Kim, feigning tears. `I came only to wash dishes in return

for a bellyful.'



<P>`All Umballa is on the same errand. Get hence. They go in now with the

soup. Think you that we who serve Creighton Sahib need strange scullions

to help us through a big dinner?'



<P>`It is a very big dinner,' said Kim, looking at the plates.



<P>`Small wonder. The guest of honour is none other than the Jang-i-Lat

Sahib [the Commander-in-Chief].'



<P>`Ho!' said Kim, with the correct guttural note of wonder. He had learned

what he wanted, and when the scullion turned he was gone.



<P>`And all that trouble,' said he to himself, thinking as usual in Hindustani,

`for a horse's pedigree! Mahbub Ali should have come to me to learn a little

lying. Every time before that I have borne a message it concerned a woman.

Now it is men. Better. The tall man said that they will loose a great army

to punish someone - somewhere - the news goes to Pindi and Peshawur. There

are also guns. Would I had crept nearer. It is big news!'



<P>He returned to find the cultivator's cousin's younger brother discussing

the family law-suit in all its bearings with the cultivator and his wife

and a few friends, while the lama dozed. After the evening meal some one

passed him a water-pipe; and Kim felt very much of a man as he pulled at

the smooth coconut-shell, his legs spread abroad in the moonlight, his

tongue clicking in remarks from time to time. His hosts were most polite;

for the cultivator's wife had told them of his vision of the Red Bull,

and of his probable descent from another world. Moreover, the lama was

a great and venerable curiosity. The family priest, an old, tolerant Sarsut

Brahmin, dropped in later, and naturally started a theological argument

to impress the family. By creed, of course, they were all on their priest's

side, but the lama was the guest and the novelty. His gentle kindliness,

and his impressive Chinese quotations, that sounded like spells, delighted

them hugely; and in this sympathetic, simple air, he expanded like the

Bodhisat's own lotus, speaking of his life in the great hills of Such-zen,

before, as he said, `I rose up to seek enlightenment.'



<P>Then it came out that in those worldly days he had been a master-hand

at casting horoscopes and nativities; and the family priest led him on

to describe his methods; each giving the planets names that the other could

not understand, and pointing upwards as the big stars sailed across the

dark. The children of the house tugged unrebuked at his rosary; and he

clean forgot the Rule which forbids looking at women as he talked of enduring

snows, landslips, blocked passes, the remote cliffs where men find sapphires

and turquoise, and that wonderful upland road that leads at last into Great

China itself.



<P>`How thinkest thou of this one?' said the cultivator aside to the priest.



<P>`A holy man - a holy man indeed. His Gods are not the Gods, but his

feet are upon the Way,' was the answer. `And his methods of nativities,

though that is beyond thee, are wise and sure.'



<P>`Tell me,' said Kim lazily, `whether I find my Red Bull on a green field,

as was promised me.'



<P>`What knowledge hast thou of thy birth-hour?' the priest asked, swelling

with importance.



<P>`Between first and second cockcrow of the first night in May.'



<P>`Of what year?'



<P>`I do not know; but upon the hour that I cried first fell the great

earthquake in Srinagar which is in Kashmir.' This Kim had from the woman

who took care of him, and she again from Kimball O'Hara. The earthquake

had been felt in India, and for long stood a leading date in the Punjab.



<P>`Ai!' said a woman excitedly. This seemed to make Kim's supernatural

origin more certain. `Was not such an one's daughter born then - '



<P>`And her mother bore her husband four sons in four years - all likely

boys,' cried the cultivator's wife, sitting outside the circle in the shadow.



<P>`None reared in the knowledge,' said the family priest, `forget how

the planets stood in their Houses upon that night.' He began to draw in

the dust of the courtyard. `At least thou hast good claim to a half of

the House of the Bull. How runs thy prophecy?'



<P>`Upon a day,' said Kim, delighted at the sensation he was creating,

`I shall be made great by means of a Red Bull on a green field, but first

there will enter two men making all things ready.'



<P>`Yes: thus ever at the opening of a vision. A thick darkness that clears

slowly; anon one enters with a broom making ready the place. Then begins

the Sight. Two men - thou sayest? Ay, ay. The Sun, leaving the House of

the Bull, enters that of the Twins. Hence the two men of the prophecy.

Let us now consider. Fetch me a twig, little one.'



<P>He knitted his brows, scratched, smoothed out, and scratched again in

the dust mysterious signs - to the wonder of all save the lama, who, with

fine instinct, forbore to interfere.



<P>At the end of half an hour, he tossed the twig from him with a grunt.



<P>`Hm! Thus say the stars. Within three days come the two men to make

all things ready. After them follows the Bull; but the sign over against

him is the sign of War and armed men.'



<P>`There was indeed a man of the Ludhiana Sikhs in the carriage from Lahore,'

said the cultivator's wife hopefully.



<P>`Tck! Armed men - many hundreds. What concern hast thou with war?' said

the priest to Kim. `Thine is a red and an angry sign of War to be loosed

very soon.'



<P>`None - none,' said the lama earnestly. `We seek only peace and our

River.'



<P>Kim smiled, remembering what he had overheard in the dressing-room.

Decidedly he was a favourite of the stars.



<P>The priest brushed his foot over the rude horoscope. `More than this

I cannot see. In three days comes the Bull to thee, boy.'



<P>`And my River, my River,' pleaded the lama. `I had hoped his Bull would

lead us both to the River.'



<P>`Alas, for that wondrous River, my brother,' the priest replied. `Such

things are not common.'



<P>Next morning, though they were pressed to stay, the lama insisted on

departure. They gave Kim a large bundle of good food and nearly three annas

in copper money for the needs of the road, and with many blessings watched

the two go southward in the dawn.



<P>`Pity it is that these and such as these could not be freed from the

Wheel of Things,' said the lama.



<P>`Nay, then would only evil people be left on the earth, and who would

give us meat and shelter?' quoth Kim, stepping merrily under his burden.



<P>`Yonder is a small stream. Let us look,' said the lama, and he led from

the white road across the fields; walking into a very hornets' nest of

pariah dogs.

<P><I>The Juggler's Song, op. 15</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

Followed a sudden natural reaction.



<P>`Now am I alone - all alone,' he thought. `In all India is no one so

alone as I! If I die today, who shall bring the news - and to whom? If

I live and God is good, there will be a price upon my head, for I am a

Son of the Charm - I, Kim.'



<P>A very few white people, but many Asiatics, can throw themselves into

a mazement as it were by repeating their own names over and over again

to themselves, letting the mind go free upon speculation as to what is

called personal identity. When one grows older, the power, usually, departs,

but while it lasts it may descend upon a man at any moment.



<P>`Who is Kim - Kim - Kim?'



<P>He squatted in a corner of the clanging waiting-room, rapt from all

other thoughts; hands folded in lap, and pupils contracted to pin-points.

In a minute - in another half-second - he felt he would arrive at the solution

of the tremendous puzzle; but here, as always happens, his mind dropped

away from those heights with a rush of a wounded bird, and passing his

hand before his eyes, he shook his head.



<P>A long-haired Hindu <I>bairagi</I> [holy man], who had just bought a

ticket, halted before him at that moment and stared intently.



<P>`I also have lost it,' he said sadly. `It is one of the Gates to the

Way, but for me it has been shut many years.'



<P>`What is the talk?' said Kim, abashed.



<P>`Thou wast wondering there in thy spirit what manner of thing thy soul

might be. The seizure came of a sudden. <I>I</I> know. Who should know

but I? Whither goest thou?'



<P>`Toward Kashi [Benares].'



<P>`There are no Gods there. I have proved them. I go to Prayag [Allahabad]

for the fifth time - seeking the Road to Enlightenment. Of what faith art

thou?'



<P>`I too am a Seeker,' said Kim, using one of the lama's pet words. `Though'

- he forgot his Northern dress for the moment - `though Allah alone knoweth

what I seek.'



<P>The old fellow slipped the <I>bairagi's</I> crutch under his armpit

and sat down on a patch of ruddy leopard's skin as Kim rose at the call

for the Benares train.



<P>`Go in hope, little brother,' he said. `It is a long road to the feet

of the One; but thither do we all travel.'



<P>Kim did not feel so lonely after this, and ere he had sat out twenty

miles in the crowded compartment, was cheering his neighbours with a string

of most wonderful yarns about his own and his master's magical gifts.



<P>Benares struck him as a peculiarly filthy city, though it was pleasant

to find how his cloth was respected. At least one-third of the population

prays eternally to some group or other of the many million deities, and

so reveres every sort of holy man. Kim was guided to the Temple of the

Tirthankars, about a mile outside the city, near Sarnath, by a chance-met

Punjabi farmer - a Kamboh from Jullundurway who had appealed in vain to

every God of his homestead to cure his small son, and was trying Benares

as a last resort.



<P>`Thou art from the North?' he asked, shouldering through the press of

the narrow, stinking streets much like his own pet bull at home.



<P>`Ay, I know the Punjab. My mother was a <I>pahareen</I>, but my father

came from Amritzar - by Jandiala,' said Kim, oiling his ready tongue for

the needs of the Road.



<P>`Jandiala - Jullundur? Oho! Then we be neighbours in some sort, as it

were.' He nodded tenderly to the wailing child in his arms. `Whom dost

thou serve?'



<P>`A most holy man at the Temple of the Tirthankers.'



<P>`They are all most holy and - most greedy,' said the Jat with bitterness.

`I have walked the pillars and trodden the temples till my feet are flayed,

and the child is no whit better. And the mother being sick too... Hush,

then, little one... We changed his name when the fever came. We put him

into girl's clothes. There was nothing we did not do, except - I said to

his mother when she bundled me off to Benares - she should have come with

me - I <I>said</I> Sakhi Sarwar Sultan would serve us best. We know His

generosity, but these down-country Gods are strangers.'



<P>The child turned on the cushion of the huge corded arms and looked at

Kim through heavy eyelids.



<P>`And was it all worthless?' Kim asked, with easy interest.



<P>`All worthless - all worthless,' said the child, lips cracking with

fever.



<P>`The Gods have given him a good mind, at least,' said the father proudly.

`To think he should have listened so cleverly. Yonder is thy Temple. Now

I am a poor man - many priests have dealt with me - but my son is my son,

and if a gift to thy master can cure him - I am at my very wits' end.'



<P>Kim considered for a while, tingling with pride. Three years ago he

would have made prompt profit on the situation and gone his way without

a thought; but now, the very respect the Jat paid him proved that he was

a man. Moreover, he had tasted fever once or twice already, and knew enough

to recognize starvation when he saw it.



<P>`Call him forth and I will give him a bond on my best yoke, so that

the child is cured.'



<P>Kim halted at the carved outer door of the temple. A white-clad Oswal

banker from Ajmir, his sins of usury new wiped out, asked him what he did.



<P>`I am <I>chela</I> to Teshoo Lama, an Holy One from Bhotiyal - within

there. He bade me come. I wait. Tell him.'



<P>`Do not forget the child,' cried the importunate Jat over his shoulder,

and then bellowed in Punjabi; `O Holy One - O disciple of the Holy One

- O Gods above all the Worlds - behold affliction sitting at the gate!'

That cry is so common in Benares that the passers never turned their heads.



<P>The Oswal, at peace with mankind, carried the message into the darkness

behind him, and the easy, uncounted Eastern minutes slid by; for the lama

was asleep in his cell, and no priest would wake him. When the click of

his rosary again broke the hush of the inner court where the calm images

of the Arhats stand, a novice whispered, `Thy <I>chela</I> is here,' and

the old man strode forth, forgetting the end of that prayer.



<P>Hardly had the tall figure shown in the doorway than the Jat ran before

him, and, lifting up the child, cried: `Look upon this, Holy One; and if

the Gods will, he lives - he lives!'



<P>He fumbled in his waist-belt and drew out a small silver coIn.



<P>`What is now?' The lama's eyes turned to Kim. It was noticeable he spoke

far clearer Urdu than long ago, under Zam-Zammah; but the father would

allow no private talk.



<P>`It is no more than a fever,' said Kim. `The child is not well fed.'



<P>`He sickens at everything, and his mother is not here.'



<P>`If it be permitted, I may cure, Holy One.'



<P>`What! Have they made thee a healer? Wait here,' said the lama, and

he sat down by the Jat upon the lowest step of the temple, while Kim, looking

out of the corner of his eyes, slowly opened the little betel-box. He had

dreamed dreams at school of returning to the lama as a Sahib - of chaffing

the old man before he revealed himself - boy's dreams all. There was more

drama in this abstracted, brow-puckered search through the tabloid-bottles,

with a pause here and there for thought and a muttered invocation between

whiles. Quinine he had in tablets, and dark brown meat-lozenges - beef

most probably, but that was not <I>his</I> business. The little thing would

not eat, but it sucked at a lozenge greedily, and said it liked the salt

taste.



<P>`Take then these six.' Kim handed them to the man. `Praise the Gods,

and boil three in milk; other three in water. After he has drunk the milk

give him this' (it was the half of a quinine pill), `and wrap him warm.

Give him the water of the other three, and the other half of this white

pill when he wakes. Meantime, here is another brown medicine that he may

suck at on the way home.'



<P>`Gods, what wisdom!' said the Kamboh, snatching.



<P>It was as much as Kim could remember of his own treatment in a bout

of autumn malaria - if you except the patter that he added to impress the

lama.



<P>`Now go! Come again in the morning.'



<P>`But the price - the price,' said the Jat, and threw back his sturdy

shoulders. `My son is my son. Now that he will be whole again, how shall

I go back to his mother and say I took help by the wayside and did not

even give a bowl of curds in return?'



<P>`They are alike, these Jats,' said Kim softly. `The Jat stood on his

dunghill and the King's elephants went by. `O driver,' said he, `what will

you sell those little donkeys for?''



<P>The Jat burst into a roar of laughter, stifled with apologies to the

lama. `It is the saying of my own country - the very talk of it. So are

we Jats all. I will come tomorrow with the child; and the blessing of the

Gods of the Homesteads - who are good little Gods - be on you both... Now,

son, we grow strong again. Do not spit it out, little Princeling! King

of my Heart, do not spit it out, and we shall be strong men, wrestlers

and club-wielders, by morning.'



<P>He moved away, crooning and mumbling. The lama turned to Kim, and all

the loving old soul of him looked out through his narrow eyes.



<P>`To heal the sick is to acquire merit; but first one gets knowledge.

That was wisely done, O Friend of all the World.'



<P>`I was made wise by thee, Holy One,' said Kim, forgetting the little

play just ended; forgetting St Xavier's; forgetting his white blood; forgetting

even the Great Game as he stooped, Mohammedan-fashion, to touch his master's

feet in the dust of the Jain temple. `My teaching I owe to thee. I have

eaten thy bread three years. My time is finished. I am loosed from the

schools. I come to thee.'



<P>`Herein is my reward. Enter! Enter! And is all well?' They passed to

the inner court, where the afternoon sun sloped golden across. `Stand that

I may see. So!' He peered critically. `It is no longer a child, but a man,

ripened in wisdom, walking as a physician. I did well - I did well when

I gave thee up to the armed men on that black night. Dost thou remember

our first day under Zam-Zammah?'



<P>`Ay,' said Kim. `Dost thou remember when I leapt off the carriage the

first day I went to - '



<P>`The Gates of Learning? Truly. And the day that we ate the cakes together

at the back of the river by Nucklao. Aha! Many times hast thou begged for

me, but that day I begged for thee.'



<P>`Good reason,' quoth Kim. `I was then a scholar in the Gates of Learning,

and attired as a Sahib. Do not forget, Holy One,' he went on playfully.

`I am still a Sahib - by thy favour.'



<P>`True. And a Sahib in most high esteem. Come to my cell, <I>chela</I>.'



<P>`How is that known to thee?'



<P>The lama smiled. `First by means of letters from the kindly priest whom

we met in the camp of armed men; but he is now gone to his own country,

and I sent the money to his brother.' Colonel Creighton, who had succeeded

to the trusteeship when Father Victor went to England with the Mavericks,

was hardly the Chaplain's brother. `But I do not well understand Sahibs'

letters. They must be interpreted to me. I chose a surer way. Many times

when I returned from my Search to this Temple, which has always been a

nest to me, there came one seeking Enlightenment - a man from Leh - that

had been, he said, a Hindu, but wearied of all those Gods.' The lama pointed

to the Arhats.



<P>`A fat man?' said Kim, a twinkle in his eye.



<P>`Very fat; but I perceived in a little his mind was wholly given up

to useless things - such as devils and charms and the form and fashion

of our tea-drinkings in the monasteries, and by what road we initiated

the novices. A man abounding in questions; but he was a friend of thine,

<I>chela</I>. He told me that thou wast on the road to much honour as ascribe.

And I see thou art a physician.'



<P>`Yes, that am I - a scribe, when I am a Sahib, but it is set aside when

I come as thy disciple. I have accomplished the years appointed for a Sahib.'



<P>`As it were a novice?' said the lama, nodding his head. `Art thou freed

from the schools? I would not have thee unripe.'



<P>`I am all free. In due time I take service under the Government as a

scribe - '



<P>`Not as a warrior. That is well.'



<P>`But first I come to wander - with thee. Therefore I am here. Who begs

for thee, these days?' he went on quickly. The ice was thin.



<P>`Very often I beg myself; but, as thou knowest, I am seldom here, except

when I come to look again at my disciple. From one end to another of Hind

have I travelled afoot and in the <I>te-rain</I>. A great and a wonderful

land! But here, when I put in, is as though I were in my own Bhotiyal.'



<P>He looked round the little clean cell complacently. A low cushion gave

him a seat, on which he had disposed himself in the cross-legged attitude

of the Bodhisat emerging from meditation; a black teak-wood table, not

twenty inches high, set with copper tea-cups, was before him. In one corner

stood a tiny altar, also of heavily carved teak, bearing a copper-gilt

image of the seated Buddha and fronted by a lamp, an incense-holder, and

a pair of copper flower-pots.



<P>`The Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House acquired merit by giving

me these a year since,' he said, following Kim's eye. `When one is far

from one's own land such things carry remembrance; and we must reverence

the Lord for that He showed the Way. See!' He pointed to a curiously-built

mound of coloured rice crowned with a fantastic metal ornament. `When I

Was Abbot in my own place - before I came to better knowledge - I made

that offering daily. It is the Sacrifice of the Universe to the Lord. Thus

do we of Bhotiyal offer all the world daily to the Excellent Law. And I

do it even now, though I know that the Excellent One is beyond all pinchings

and pattings.' He snuffed from his gourd.



<P>`It is well done, Holy One,' Kim murmured, sinking at ease on the cushions,

very happy and rather tired.



<P>`And also,' the old man chuckled, `I write pictures of the Wheel of

Life. Three days to a picture. I was busied on it - or it may be I shut

my eyes a little - when they brought word of thee. It is good to have thee

here: I will show thee my art - not for pride's sake, but because thou

must learn. The Sahibs have not <I>all</I> this world's wisdom.'



<P>He drew from under the table a sheet of strangely scented yellow Chinese

paper, the brushes, and slab of Indian ink. In cleanest, severest outline

he had traced the Great Wheel with its six spokes, whose centre is the

conjoined Hog, Snake, and Dove (Ignorance, Anger, and Lust), and whose

compartments are all the Heavens and Hells, and all the chances of human

life. Men say that the Bodhisat Himself first drew it with grains of rice

upon dust, to teach His disciples the cause of things. Many ages have crystallized

it into a most wonderful convention crowded with hundreds of little figures

whose every line carries a meaning. Few can translate the picture-parable;

there are not twenty in all the world who can draw it surely without a

copy: of those who can both draw and expound are but three.



<P>`I have a little learned to draw,' said Kim. `But this is a marvel beyond

marvels.'



<P>`I have written it for many years,' said the lama. `Time was when I

could write it all between one lamp-lighting and the next. I will teach

thee the art - after due preparation; and I will show thee the meaning

of the Wheel.'



<P>`We take the Road, then?'



<P>`The Road and our Search. I was but waiting for thee. It was made plain

to me in a hundred dreams - notably one that came upon the night of the

day that the Gates of Learning first shut - that without thee I should

never find my River. Again and again, as thou knowest, I put this from

me, fearing an illusion. Therefore I would not take thee with me that day

at Lucknow, when we ate the cakes. I would not take thee till the time

was ripe and auspicious. From the Hills to the Sea, from the Sea to the

Hills have I gone, but it was vain. Then I remembered the <I>J&icirc;taka</I>.'



<P>He told Kim the story of the elephant with the leg-iron, as he had told

it so often to the Jain priests.



<P>`Further testimony is not needed,' he ended serenely. `Thou wast sent

for an aid. That aid removed, my Search came to naught. Therefore we will

go out again together, and our Search is sure.'



<P>`Whither go we?'



<P>`What matters, Friend of all the World? The Search, I say, is sure.

If need be, the River will break from the ground before us. I acquired

merit when I sent thee to the Gates of Learning, and gave thee the jewel

that is Wisdom. Thou didst return, I saw even now, a follower of Sakyamuni,

the Physician,' whose altars are many in Bhotiyal. It is sufficient. We

are together, and all things are as they were - Friend of all the World

- Friend of the Stars - my <I>chela</I>!'



<P>Then they talked of matters secular; but it was noticeable that the

lama never demanded any details of life at St Xavier's, nor showed the

faintest curiosity as to the manners and customs of Sahibs. His mind moved

all in the past, and he revived every step of their wonderful first journey

together, rubbing his hands and chuckling, till it pleased him to curl

himself up into the sudden sleep of old age.



<P>Kim watched the last dusty sunshine fade out of the court, and played

with his ghost-dagger and rosary. The clamour of Benares, oldest of all

earth's cities awake before the Gods, day and night, beat round the walls

as the sea's roar round a breakwater. Now and again, a Jain priest crossed

the court, with some small offering to the images, and swept the path about

him lest by chance he should take the life of a living thing. A lamp twinkled,

and there followed the sound of a prayer. Kim watched the stars as they

rose one after another in the still, sticky dark, till he fell asleep at

the foot of the altar. That night he dreamed in Hindustani, with never

an English word...



<P>`Holy One, there is the child to whom we gave the medicine,' he said,

about three o'clock in the morning, when the lama, also waking from dreams,

would have fared forth on pilgrimage.



<P>`The Jat will he here at the light.'



<P>`I am well answered. In my haste I would have done a wrong.' He sat

down on the cushions and returned to his rosary. `Surely old folk are as

children,' he said pathetically. `They desire a matter - behold, it must

be done at once, or they fret and weep! Many times when I was upon the

Road I have been ready to stamp with my feet at the hindrance of an ox-cart

in the way, or a mere cloud of dust. It was not so when I was a man - a

long time ago. None the less it is wrongful - '



<P>`But thou art indeed old, Holy One.'



<P>`The thing was done. A Cause was put out into the world, md, old or

young, sick or sound, knowing or unknowing, who can rein in the effect

of that Cause? Does the Wheel hang still if a child spin it - or a drunkard?

<I>Chela</I>, this is a great and a terrible world.'



<P>`I think it good,' Kim yawned. `What is there to eat? I have not eaten

since yesterday even.'



<P>`I had forgotten thy need. Yonder is good Bhotiyal tea and cold rice.'



<P>`We cannot walk far on such stuff.' Kim felt all the European's lust

for flesh-meat, which is not accessible in a Jain temple. Yet, instead

of going out at once with the begging-bowl, he stayed his stomach on slabs

of cold rice till the full dawn. It brought the farmer, voluble, stuttering

with gratitude.



<P>`In the night the fever broke and the sweat came,' he cried. `Feel here

- his skin is fresh and new! He esteemed the salt lozenges, and took milk

with greed.' He drew the cloth from the child's face, and it smiled sleepily

at Kim. A little knot of Jain priests, silent but all-observant, gathered

by the temple door. They knew, and Kim knew that they knew, how the old

lama had met his disciple. Being courteous folk, they had not obtruded

themselves overnight by presence, word, or gesture. Wherefore Kim repaid

them as the sun rose.



<P>`Thank the Gods of the Jains, brother,' he said, not knowing how those

Gods were named. `The fever is indeed broken.'



<P>`Look! See!' The lama beamed in the background upon his hosts of three

years. `Was there ever such a <I>chela</I>? He follows our Lord the Healer.'



<P>Now the Jains officially recognize all the Gods of the Hindu creed,

as well as the Lingam and the Snake. They wear the Brahminical thread;

they adhere to every claim of Hindu cast-law. But, because they knew and

loved the lama, because he was an old man, because he sought the Way, because

he was their guest, and because he collogued long of nights with the head-priest

- as free-thinking a metaphysician as ever split one hair into seventy

- they murmured assent.



<P>`Remember,' Kim bent over the child - `this trouble may come again.'



<P>`Not if thou hast the proper spell,' said the father.



<P>`But in a little while we go away.'



<P>`True,' said the lama to all the Jains. `We go now together upon the

Search whereof I have often spoken. I waited till my <I>chela</I> was ripe.

Behold him! We go North. Never again shall I look upon this place of my

rest, O people of good will.'



<P>`But I am not a beggar.' The cultivator rose to his feet, clutching

the child.



<P>`Be still. Do not trouble the Holy One,' a priest cried.



<P>`Go,' Kim whispered. `Meet us again under the big railway bridge, and

for the sake of all the Gods of our Punjab, bring food - curry, pulse,

cakes fried in fat, and sweetmeats. Specially sweetmeats. Be swift!'



<P>The pallor of hunger suited Kim very well as he stood, tall and slim,

in his sand-coloured, sweeping robes, one hand on his rosary and the other

in the attitude of benediction, faithfully copied from the lama. An English

observer might have said that he looked rather like the young saint of

a stained-glass window, whereas he was but a growing lad faint with emptiness.



<P>Long and formal were the farewells, thrice ended and thrice renewed.

The Seeker - he who had invited the lama to that haven from far-away Tibet,

a silver-faced, hairless ascetic took no part in it, but meditated, as

always, alone among the images. The others were very human; pressing small

comforts upon the old man - a betel-box, a fine new iron pencase, a food-bag,

and such-like - warning him against the dangers of the world without, and

prophesying a happy end to the Search. Meantime Kim, lonelier than ever,

squatted on the steps, and swore to himself in the language of St Xavier's.



<P>`But it is my own fault,' he concluded. `With Mahbub, I ate Mahbub's

bread, or Lurgan Sahib's. At St Xavier's, three meals a day. Here I must

jolly-well look out for myself. Besides, I am not in good training. <I>How</I>

I could eat a plate of beef now!... Is it finished, Holy One?'



<P>The lama, both hands raised, intoned a final blessing in ornate Chinese.

`I must lean on thy shoulder,' said he, as the temple gates closed. `We

grow stiff; I think.'



<P>The weight of a six-foot man is not light to steady through miles of

crowded streets, and Kim, loaded down with bundles and packages for the

way, was glad to reach the shadow of the railway bridge.



<P>`Here we eat,' he said resolutely, as the Kamboh, blue-robed and smiling,

hove in sight, a basket in one hand and the child in the other.



<P>`Fall to, Holy Ones!' he cried from fifty yards. (They were by the shoal

under the first bridge-span, out of sight of hungry priests.) `Rice and

good curry, cakes all warm and well scented with <I>hing</I> [asafoetida],

curds and sugar. King of my fields,' - this to the small son - `let us

show these holy men that we Jats of Jullundur can pay a service... I had

heard the Jains would eat nothing that they had not cooked, but truly'

- he looked away politely over the broad river - `where there is no eye

there is no caste.'



<P>`And we,' said Kim, turning his back and heaping a leaf-platter for

the lama, `are beyond all castes.'



<P>They gorged themselves on the good food in silence. Nor till he had

licked the last of the sticky sweetstuff from his little finger did Kim

note that the Kamboh too was girt for travel.



<P>`If our roads lie together,' he said roughly, `I go with thee. One does

not often find a worker of miracles, and the child is still weak. But <I>I</I>

am not altogether a reed.' He picked up his <I>lathi</I> - a five-foot

male-bamboo ringed with bands of polished iron - and flourished it in the

air. `The Jats are called quarrelsome, but that is not true. Except when

we are crossed, we are like our own buffaloes.'



<P>`So be it,' said Kim. `A good stick is a good reason.'



<P>The lama gazed placidly up-stream, where in long, smudged perspective

the ceaseless columns of smoke go up from the burning-ghats by the river.

Now and again, despite all municipal regulations, the fragment of a half-burned

body bobbed by on the full current.



<P>`But for thee,' said the Kamboh to Kim, drawing the child into his hairy

breast, `I might today have gone thither - with this one. The priests tell

us that Benares is holy which none doubt - and desirable to die in. But

I do not know their Gods, and they ask for money; and when one has done

one worship a shaved-head vows it is of none effect except one do another.

Wash here! Wash there! Pour, drink, lave, and scatter flowers - but always

pay the priests. No, the Punjab for me, and the soil of the Jullundur-<I>doab</I>

for the best soil in it.'



<P>`I have said many times - in the Temple, I think - that if need be,

the River will open at our feet. We will therefore go North,' said the

lama, rising. `I remember a pleasant place, set about with fruit-trees,

where one can walk in meditation - and the air is cooler there. It comes

from the Hills and the snow of the Hills.'



<P>`What is the name?' said Kim.



<P>`How should I know? Didst thou not - no, that was after the Army rose

out of the earth and took thee away. I abode there in meditation in a room

against the dovecot - except when she talked eternally.'



<P>`Oho! the woman from Kulu. That is by Saharunpore.' Kim laughed.



<P>`How does the spirit move thy master? Does he go afoot, for the sake

of past sins?' the Jat demanded cautiously. `It is a far cry to Delhi.'



<P>`No,' said Kim. `I will beg a <I>tikkut</I> for the <I>te-rain.'</I>

One does not own to the possession of money in India.



<P>`Then, in the name of the Gods, let us take the fire-carriage. My son

is best in his mother's arms. The Government has brought on us many taxes,

but it gives us one good thing - the <I>te-rain</I> that joins friends

and unites the anxious. A wonderful matter is the <I>te-rain</I>.'



<P>They all piled into it a couple of hours later, and slept through the

heat of the day. The Kamboh plied Kim with ten thousand questions as to

the lama's walk and work in life, and received some curious answers. Kim

was content to be where he was, to look out upon the flat North-Western

landscape, and to-talk to the changing mob of fellow-passengers. Even today,

tickets and ticket-clipping are dark oppression to Indian rustics. They

do not understand why, when they have paid for a magic piece of paper,

strangers should punch great pieces out of the charm. So, long and furious

are the debates between travellers and Eurasian ticket-collectors. Kim

assisted at two or three with grave advice, meant to darken counsel and

to show off his wisdom before the lama and the admiring Kamboh. But at

Somna Road the Fates sent him a matter to think upon. There tumbled into

the compartment, as the train was moving off, a mean, lean little person

- a Mahratta, so far as Kim could judge by the cock of the tight turban.

His face was cut, his muslin upper-garment was badly torn, and one leg

was bandaged. He told them that a country-cart had upset and nearly slain

him: he was going to Delhi, where his son lived. Kim watched him closely.

If; as he asserted, he had been rolled over and over on the earth, there

should have been signs of gravel-rash on the skin. But all his injuries

seemed clean cuts, and a mere fall from a cart could not cast a man into

such extremity of terror. As, with shaking fingers, he knotted up the torn

cloth about his neck he laid bare an amulet of the kind called a keeper-up

of the heart. Now, amulets are common enough, but they are not generally

strung on square-plaited copper wire, and still fewer amulets bear black

enamel on silver. There were none except the Kamboh and the lama in the

compartment, which, luckily, was of an old type with solid ends. Kim made

as to scratch in his bosom, and thereby lifted his own amulet. The Mahratta's

face changed altogether at the sight, and he disposed the amulet fairly

on his breast.



<P>`Yes,' he went on to the Kamboh, `I was in haste, and the cart, driven

by a bastard, bound its wheel in a water-cut, and besides the harm done

to me there was lost a full dish of <I>tarkeean</I>. I was not a Son of

the Charm [a lucky man] that day.'



<P>`That was a great loss,' said the Kamboh, withdrawing interest. His

experience of Benares had made him suspicious.



<P>`Who cooked it?' said Kim.



<P>`A woman.' The Mahratta raised his eyes.



<P>`But all women can cook <I>tarkeean</I>,' said the Kamboh. `It is a

good curry, as I know.'



<P>`Oh yes, it is a good curry,' said the Mahratta.



<P>`And cheap,' said Kim. `But what about caste?'



<P>`Oh, there is no caste where men go to - look for <I>tarkeean</I>,'

the Mahratta replied, in the prescribed cadence. `Of whose service art

thou?'



<P>`Of the service of this Holy One.' Kim pointed to the happy, drowsy

lama, who woke with a jerk at the well-loved word.



<P>`Ah, he was sent from Heaven to aid me. He is called the Friend of all

the World. He is also called the Friend of the Stars. He walks as a physician

- his time being ripe. Great is his wisdom.'



<P>`And a Son of the Charm,' said Kim under his breath, as the Kamboh made

haste to prepare a pipe lest the Mahratta should beg.



<P>`And who is <I>that</I>?' the Mahratta asked, glancing sideways nervously.



<P>`One whose child I - we have cured, who lies under great debt to us.

- Sit by the window, man from Jullundur. Here is a sick one.'



<P>`Humph! I have no desire to mix with chance-met wastrels. <I>My</I>

ears are not long. <I>I</I> am not a woman wishing to overhear secrets.'

The Jat slid himself heavily into a far corner.



<P>`Art thou anything of a healer? I am ten leagues deep in calamity,'

cried the Mahratta, picking up the cue.



<P>`This man is cut and bruised all over. I go about to cure him,' Kim

retorted. `None interfered between thy babe and me.'



<P>`I am rebuked,' said the Kamboh meekly. `I am thy debtor for the life

of my son. Thou art a miracle-worker - I know it.'



<P>`Show me the cuts.' Kim bent over the Mahratta's neck, his heart nearly

choking him; for this was the Great Game with a vengeance. `Now, tell thy

tale swiftly, brother, while I say a charm.'



<P>`I come from the South, where my work lay. One of us they slew by the

roadside. Hast thou heard?' Kim shook his head. He, of course, knew nothing

of E23's predecessor, slain down South in the habit of an Arab trader.

`Having found a certain letter which I was sent to seek, I came away. I

escaped from the city and ran to Mhow. So sure was I that none knew, I

did not change my face. At Mhow a woman brought charge against me of theft

of jewellery in that city which I had left. Then I saw the cry was out

against me. I ran from Mhow by night, bribing the police, who had been

bribed to hand me over without question to my enemies in the South. Then

I lay in old Chitor city a week, a penitent in a temple, but I could not

get rid of the letter which was my charge. I buried it under the Queen's

Stone, at Chitor, in the place known to us all.'



<P>Kim did not know, but not for worlds would he have broken the thread.



<P>`At Chitor, look you, I was all in Kings' country; for Kotah to the

east is beyond the Queen's law, and east again lie Jaipur and Gwalior.

Neither love spies, and there is no justice. I was hunted like a wet jackal;

but I broke through at Bandakui, where I heard there was a charge against

me of murder in the city I had left - of the murder of a boy. They have

both the corpse and the witnesses waiting.'



<P>`But cannot the Government protect?'



<P>`We of the Game are beyond protection. If we die, we die. Our names

are blotted from the book. That is all. At Bandakui, where lives one of

Us, I thought to slip the scent by changing my face, and so made me a Mahratta.

Then I came to Agra, and would have turned back to Chitor to recover the

letter. So sure I was I had slipped them. Therefore I did not send a <I>tar</I>

[telegram] to any one saying where the letter lay. I wished the credit

of it all.'



<P>Kim nodded. He understood that feeling well.



<P>`But at Agra, walking in the streets, a man cried a debt against me,

and approaching with many witnesses, would hale me to the courts then and

there. Oh, they are clever in the South! He recognized me as his agent

for cotton. May he burn in Hell for it!'



<P>`And wast thou?'



<P>`O fool! I was the man they sought for the matter of the letter! I ran

into the Fleshers' Ward and came out by the House of the Jew, who feared

a riot and pushed me forth. I came afoot to Somna Road - I had only money

for my <I>tikkut</I> to Delhi - and there, while I lay in a ditch with

a fever, one sprang out of the bushes and beat me and cut me and searched

me from head to foot. Within earshot of the <I>te-rain</I> it was!'



<P>`Why did he not slay thee out of hand?'



<P>`They are not so foolish. If I am taken in Delhi at the instance of

lawyers, upon a proven charge of murder, my body is handed over to the

State that desires it. I go back guarded, and then - I die slowly for an

example to the rest of Us. The South is not my country. I run in circles

- like a goat with one eye. I have not eaten for two days. I am marked'

- he touched the filthy bandage on his leg - `so that they will know me

at Delhi.'



<P>`Thou art safe in the <I>te-rain</I>, at least.'



<P>`Live a year at the Great Game and tell me that again! The wires will

be out against me at Delhi, describing every tear and rag upon me. Twenty

- a hundred, if need be - will have seen me slay that boy. And thou art

useless!'



<P>Kim knew enough of native methods of attack not to doubt that the case

would be deadly complete - even to the corpse. The Mahratta twitched his

fingers with pain from time to time. The Kamboh in his corner glared sullenly;

the lama was busy over his beads; and Kim, fumbling doctor-fashion at the

man's neck, thought out his plan between invocations.



<P>`Hast thou a charm to change my shape? Else I am dead. Five - ten minutes

alone, if I had not been so pressed, and I might - '



<P>`Is he cured yet, miracle-worker?' said the Kamboh jealously. `Thou

hast chanted long enough.'



<P>`Nay. There is no cure for his hurts, as I see, except he sit for three

days in the habit of a <I>bairagi</I>.' This is a common penance, often

imposed on a fat trader by his spiritual teacher.



<P>`One priest always goes about to make another priest,' was the retort.

Like most grossly superstitious folk, the Kamboh could not keep his tongue

from deriding his Church.



<P>`Will thy son be a priest, then? It is time he took more of my quinine.'



<P>`We Jats are all buffaloes,' said the Kamboh, softening anew.



<P>Kim rubbed a finger-tip of bitterness on the child's trusting little

lips. `I have asked for nothing,' he said sternly to the father, `except

food. Dost thou grudge me that? I go to heal another man. Have I thy leave

- Prince?'



<P>Up flew the man's huge paws in supplication. `Nay - nay. Do not mock

me thus.'



<P>`It pleases me to cure this sick one. Thou shalt acquire merit by aiding.

What colour ash is there in thy pipe-bowl? White. That is auspicious. Was

there raw turmeric among thy foodstuffs?'



<P>`I - I - '



<P>`Open thy bundle!'



<P>It was the usual collection of small oddments: bits of cloth, quack

medicines, cheap fairings, a clothful of <I>atta</I> - greyish, rough-ground

native flour - twists of down-country tobacco, tawdry pipe-stems, and a

packet of curry-stuff; all wrapped in a quilt. Kim turned it over with

the air of a wise warlock, muttering a Mohammedan invocation.



<P>`This is wisdom I learned from the Sahibs,' he whispered to the lama;

and here, when one thinks of his training at Lurgan's, he spoke no more

than the truth. `There is a great evil in this man's fortune, as shown

by the Stars, which - which troubles him. Shall I take it away?'



<P>`Friend of the Stars, thou hast done well in all things. Let it be at

thy pleasure. Is it another healing?'



<P>`Quick! Be quick!' gasped the Mahratta. `The train may stop.'



<P>`A healing against the shadow of death,' said Kim, mixing the Kamboh's

flour with the mingled charcoal and tobacco ash in the red-earth bowl of

the pipe. E23, without a word, slipped off his turban and shook down his

long black hair.



<P>`That is my food - priest,' the Jat growled.



<P>`A buffalo in the temple! Hast thou dared to look even thus me far?'

said Kim. `I must do mysteries before fools; but have a care for thine

eyes. Is there a film before them already? I save the babe, and for return

thou - oh, shameless!' The man flinched at the direct gaze, for Kim was

wholly in earnest. `Shall I curse thee, or shall I - ' He picked up the

outer cloth of the bundle and threw it over the bowed head. `Dare so much

as to think a wish to see, and - and - even I cannot save thee. Sit! Be

dumb!'



<P>`I am blind - dumb. Forbear to curse! Co - come, child; we will play

a game of hiding. Do not, for my sake, look from under the cloth.'



<P>`I see hope,' said E23. `What is thy scheme?'



<P>`This comes next,' said Kim, plucking the thin body-shirt. E23 hesitated,

with all a North-West man's dislike of baring his body.



<P>`What is caste to a cut throat?' said Kim, rending it to the waist.

`We must make thee a yellow Saddhu all over. Strip - strip swiftly, and

shake thy hair over thine eyes while I scatter the ash. Now, a caste-mark

on thy forehead.' He drew from his bosom the little Survey paint-box and

a cake of crimson lake.



<P>`Art thou only a beginner?' said E23, labouring literally for the dear

life, as he slid out of his body-wrappings and stood clear in the loin-cloth

while Kim splashed in a noble caste-mark on the ash-smeared brow.



<P>`But two days entered to the Game, brother,' Kim replied. `Smear more

ash on the bosom.'



<P>`Hast thou met a physician of sick pearls?' He switched out his long,

tight-rolled turban-cloth and, with swiftest hands, rolled it over and

under about his loins into the intricate devices of a Saddhu's cincture.



<P>`Hah! Dost thou know his touch, then? He was my teacher for a while.

We must bar thy legs. Ash cures wounds. Smear it again.'



<P>`I was his pride once, but thou art almost better. The Gods are kind

to us! Give me <I>that</I>.'



<P>It was a tin box of opium pills among the rubbish of the Jat's bundle.

E23 gulped down a half handful. `They are good against hunger, fear, and

chill. And they make the eyes red too,' he explained. `Now I shall have

heart to play the Game. We lack only a Saddhu's tongs. What of the old

clothes?'



<P>Kim rolled them small, and stuffed them into the slack folds of his

tunic. With a yellow-ochre paint cake he smeared the legs and the breast,

great streaks against the background of flour, ash, and turmeric.



<P>`The blood on them is enough to hang thee, brother.'



<P>`Maybe; but no need to throw them out of the window... It is finished.'

His voice thrilled with a boy's pure delight in the Game. `Turn and look,

O Jat!'



<P>`The Gods protect us,' said the hooded Kamboh, emerging like a buffalo

from the reeds. `But - whither went the Mahratta? What hast thou done?'



<P>Kim had been trained by Lurgan Sahib; E23, by virtue of his business,

was no bad actor. In place of the tremulous, shrinking trader there lolled

against the corner an all but naked, ash-smeared, ochre-barred, dusty-haired

Saddhu, his swollen eyes - opium takes quick effect on an empty stomach

- luminous with insolence and bestial lust, his legs crossed under him,

Kim's brown rosary round his neck, and a scant yard of worn, flowered chintz

on his shoulders. The child buried his face in his amazed father's arms.



<P>`Look up, Princeling! We travel with warlocks, but they will not hurt

thee. Oh, do not cry... What is the sense of curing a child one day and

killing him with fright the next?'



<P>`The child will be fortunate all his life. He has seen a great healing.

When I was a child I made clay men and horses.'



<P>`I have made them too. S&iacute;r Ban&aacute;s, he comes in the night

and makes them all alive at the back of our kitchen-midden,' piped the

child.



<P>`And so thou art not frightened at anything. Eh, Prince?'



<P>`I was frightened because my father was frightened. I felt his arms

shake.'



<P>`Oh, chicken-man!' said Kim, and even the abashed Jat laughed. `I have

done a healing on this poor trader. He must forsake his gains and his account-books,

and sit by the wayside three nights to overcome the malignity of his enemies.

The Stars are against him.'



<P>`The fewer money-lenders the better, say I; but, Saddhu or no Saddhu,

he should pay for my stuff on his shoulders.'



<P>`So? But that is thy child on thy shoulder - given over to the burning-ghat

not two days ago. There remains one thing more. I did this charm in thy

presence because need was great. I changed his shape and his soul. None

the less, if; by any chance, O man from Jullundur, thou rememberest what

thou hast seen, either among the elders sitting under the village tree,

or in thine own house, or in company of thy priest when he blesses thy

cattle, a murrain will come among the buffaloes, and a fire in thy thatch,

and rats in the corn-bins, and the curse of our Gods upon thy fields that

they may be barren before thy feet and after thy ploughshare.' This was

part of an old curse picked up from a <I>fakir</I> by the Taksali Gate

in the days of Kim's innocence. It lost nothing by repetition.



<P>`Cease, Holy One! In mercy, cease!' cried the Jat. `Do not curse the

household. I saw nothing! I heard nothing! I am thy cow!' and he made to

grab at Kim's bare foot beating rhythmically on the carriage floor.



<P>`But since thou hast been permitted to aid me in the matter of a pinch

of flour and a little opium and such trifles as I have honoured by using

in my art, so will the Gods return a blessing,' and he gave it at length,

to the man's immense relief. It was one that he had learned from Lurgan

Sahib.



<P>The lama stared through his spectacles as he had not stared at the business

of disguisement.



<P>`Friend of the Stars,' he said at last, `thou hast acquired great wisdom.

Beware that it do not give birth to pride. No man having the Law before

his eyes speaks hastily of any matter which he has seen or encountered.'



<P>`No - no - no, indeed,' cried the farmer, fearful lest the master should

be minded to improve on the pupil. E23, with relaxed mouth, gave himself

up to the opium that is meat, tobacco, and medicine to the spent Asiatic.



<P>So, in a silence of awe and great miscomprehension, they slid into Delhi

about lamp-lighting time.

<P>O ye who tread the Narrow Way

<BR>By Tophet-flare to Judgement Day,

<BR>Be gentle when `the heathen' pray

<BR>To Buddha at Kamakura!



<P><I>Buddha at Kamakura.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

He sat, in defiance of municipal orders, astride the gun Zam-Zammah on

her brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher - the Wonder House, as the

natives call the Lahore Museum. Who hold Zam-Zammah, that <I>fire-breathing

dragon</I>, hold the Punjab, a for the great green-bronze piece is always

first of the conqueror's loot.



<P>There was some justification for Kim - he had kicked Lala Dinanath's

boy off the trunnions - since the English held the Punjab and Kim was English.

Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the vernacular

by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain sing-song;

though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the small boys of

the bazar; Kim was white - a poor white of the very poorest. The half-caste

woman who looked after him (she smoked opium, and pretended to keep a second-hand

furniture shop by the square where the cheap cabs wait) told the missionaries

that she was Kim's mother's sister; but his mother had been nursemaid in

a Colonel's family and had married Kimball O'Hara, a young colour-sergeant

of the Mavericks, an Irish regiment. He afterwards took a post on the Sind,

Punjab, and Delhi Railway, and his Regiment went home without him. The

wife died of cholera in Ferozepore, and O'Hara fell to drink and loafing

up and down the line with the keen-eyed three-year-old baby. Societies

and chaplains, anxious for the child, tried to catch him, but O'Hara drifted

away, till he came across the woman who took opium and learned the taste

from her, and died as poor whites die in India. His estate at death consisted

of three papers - one he called his <I>ne varietur</I> because those words

were written below his signature thereon, and another his <I>clearance-certificate</I>.

The third was Kim's birth-certificate. Those things, he was used to say,

in his glorious opium-hours, would yet make little Kimball a man. On no

account was Kim to part with them, for they belonged to a great piece of

magic - such magic as men practised over yonder behind the Museum, in the

big blue-and-white Jadoo-Gher - the Magic House, as we name the Masonic

Lodge. It would, he said, all come right some day, and Kim's horn would

be exalted between pillars - monstrous pillars - of beauty and strength.

The Colonel himself, riding on a horse, at the head of the finest Regiment

in the world, would attend to Kim - little Kim that should have been better

off than his father. Nine hundred first-class devils, whose God was a Red

Bull on a green field, would attend to Kim, if they had not forgotten O'Hara

- poor O'Hara that was gang-foreman on the Ferozepore line. Then he would

weep bitterly in the broken rush chair on the veranda. So it came about

after his death that the woman sewed parchment, paper, and birth-certificate

into a leather amulet-case which she strung round Kim's neck.



<P>`And some day,' she said, confusedly remembering O'Hara's prophecies,

`there will come for you a great Red Bull on a green field, and the Colonel

riding on his tall horse, yes, and' - dropping into English - `nine hundred

devils.'



<P>`Ah,' said Kim, `I shall remember. A Red Bull and a Colonel on a horse

will come, but first, my father said, will come the two men making ready

the ground for these matters. That is how my father said they always did;

and it is always so when men work magic.'



<P>If the woman had sent Kim up to the local Jadoo-Gher with those papers,

he would, of course, have been taken over by the Provincial Lodge, and

sent to the Masonic Orphanage in the Hills; but what she had heard of magic

she distrusted. Kim, too, held views of his own. As he reached the years

of indiscretion, he learned to avoid missionaries and white men of serious

aspect who asked who he was, and what he did. For Kim did nothing with

an immense success. True, he knew the wonderful walled city of Lahore from

the Delhi Gate to the outer Fort Ditch; was hand in glove with men who

led lives stranger than anything Haroun al Raschid dreamed of, and he lived

in a life wild as that of the Arabian Nights, but missionaries and secretaries

of charitable societies could not see the beauty of it. His nickname through

the wards was <I>Little Friend of all the World</I>; and very often, being

lithe and inconspicuous, he executed commissions by night on the crowded

housetops for sleek and shiny young men of fashion. It was intrigue, of

course - he knew that much, as he had known all evil since he could speak,

- but what he loved was the game for its own sake - the stealthy prowl

through the dark gullies and lanes, the crawl up a water-pipe, the sights

and sounds of the women's world on the flat roofs, and the headlong flight

from housetop to housetop under cover of the hot dark. Then there were

holy men, ash-smeared <I>fakirs</I> by their brick shrines under the trees

at the riverside, with whom he was quite familiar - greeting them as they

returned from begging-tours, and, when no one was by, eating from the same

dish. The woman who looked after him insisted with tears that he should

wear European clothes - trousers, a shirt, and a battered hat. Kim found

it easier to slip into Hindu or Mohammedan garb when engaged on certain

businesses. One of the young men of fashion - he who was found dead at

the bottom of a well on the night of the earthquake - had once given him

a complete suit of Hindu kit, the costume of a low-caste street boy, and

Kim stored it in a secret place under some baulks in Nila Ram's timber-yard,

beyond the Punjab High Court, where the fragrant deodar logs lie seasoning

after they have driven down the Ravi. When there was business or frolic

afoot, Kim would use his properties, returning at dawn to the veranda,

all tired out from shouting at the heels of a marriage procession, or yelling

at a Hindu festival. Sometimes there was food in the house, more often

there was not, and then Kim went out again to eat with his native friends.



<P>As he drummed his heels against Zam-Zammah he turned now and again from

his king-of-the-castle game with little Chota Lal and Abdullah the sweetmeat-seller's

son, to make a rude remark to the native policeman on guard over rows of

shoes at the Museum door. The big Punjabi grinned tolerantly: he knew Kim

of old. So did the water-carrier, sluicing water on the dry road from his

goat-skin bag. So did Jawahir Singh, the Museum carpenter, bent over new

packing-cases. So did everybody in sight except the peasants from the country,

hurrying up to the Wonder House to view the things that men made in their

own province and elsewhere. The Museum was given up to Indian arts and

manufactures, and anybody who sought wisdom could ask the Curator to explain.



<P>`Off! Off! Let me up!' cried Abdullah, climbing up Zam-Zammah's wheel.



<P>`Thy father was a pastry-cook, Thy mother stole the <I>ghi</I>,' sang

Kim. `All Mussalmans fell off Zam-Zammah long ago!'



<P>`Let <I>me</I> up!' shrilled little Chota Lal in his gilt-embroidered

cap. His father was worth perhaps half a million sterling, but India is

the only democratic land in the world.



<P>`The Hindus fell off Zam-Zammah too. The Mussalmans pushed them off.

Thy father was a pastry-cook - '



<P>He stopped; for there shuffled round the corner, from the roaring Motee

Bazar, such a man as Kim, who thought he knew all castes, had never seen.

He was nearly six feet high, dressed in fold upon fold of dingy stuff like

horse-blanketing, and not one fold of it could Kim refer to any known trade

or profession. At his belt hung a long open-work iron pencase and a wooden

rosary such as holy men wear. On his head was a gigantic sort of tam-o'-shanter.

His face was yellow and wrinkled, like that of Fook Shing, the Chinese

bootmaker in the bazar. His eyes turned up at the corners and looked like

little slits of onyx.



<P>`Who is that?' said Kim to his companions.



<P>`Perhaps it is a man,' said Abdullah, finger in mouth, staring.



<P>`Without doubt,' returned Kim; `but he is no man of India that I have

ever seen.'



<P>`A priest, perhaps,' said Chota Lal, spying the rosary. `See! He goes

into the Wonder House!'



<P>`Nay, nay,' said the policeman, shaking his head. `I do not understand

your talk.' The constable spoke Punjabi. `O Friend of all the World, what

does he say?'



<P>`Send him hither,' said Kim, dropping from Zam-Zammah, flourishing his

bare heels. `He is a foreigner, and thou art a buffalo.'



<P>The man turned helplessly and drifted towards the boys. He was old,

and his woollen gaberdine still reeked of the stinking artemisia of the

mountain passes.



<P>`O Children, what is that big house?' he said in very fair Urdu.



<P>`The Ajaib-Gher, the Wonder House!' Kim gave him no title - such as

Lala or Mian. He could not divine the man's creed.



<P>`Ah! The Wonder House! Can any enter?'



<P>`It is written above the door - all can enter.'



<P>`Without payment?'



<P>`I go in and out. I am no banker,' laughed Kim.



<P>`Alas! I am an old man. I did not know.' Then, fingering his rosary,

he half turned to the Museum.



<P>`What is your caste? Where is your house? Have you come far?' Kim asked.



<P>`I came by Kulu - from beyond the Kailas - but what know you? From the

Hills where' - he sighed - `the air and water are fresh and cool.'



<P>`Aha! <I>Khitai</I> [a Chinaman],' said Abdullah proudly. Fook Shing

had once chased him out of his shop for spitting at the joss above the

boots.



<P>`<I>Pahari</I> [a hillman],' said little Chota Lal.



<P>`Aye, child - a hillman from hills thou'lt never see. Didst hear of

Bhotiyal [Tibet]? I am no Khitai, but a Bhotiya [Tibetan], since you must

know - a lama - or, say, a <I>guru</I> in your tongue.'



<P>`A <I>guru</I> from Tibet,' said Kim. `I have not seen such a man. They

be Hindus in Tibet, then?'



<P>`We be followers of the Middle Way, living in peace in our lamasseries,

and I go to see the Four Holy Places before I die. Now do you, who are

children, know as much as I do who am old.' He smiled benignantly on the

boys.



<P>`Hast thou eaten?'



<P>He fumbled in his bosom and drew forth a worn wooden begging-bowl. The

boys nodded. All priests of their acquaintance begged.



<P>`I do not wish to eat yet.' He turned his head like an old tortoise

in the sunlight. `Is it true that there are many images in the Wonder House

of Lahore?' He repeated the last words as one making sure of an address.



<P>`That is true,' said Abdullah. `It is full of heathen <I>b&amp;umacron;ts</I><A HREF="notes.html">Note</A>.

Thou also art an idolater.'



<P>`Never mind <I>him</I>,' said Kim. `That is the Government's house and

there is no idolatry in it, but only a Sahib with a white beard. Come with

me and I will show.'



<P>`Strange priests eat boys,' whispered Chota Lal.



<P>`And he is a stranger and a <I>b&amp;umacron;t-parast</I><A HREF="notes.html">Note</A>

[idolater],' said Abdullah, the Mohammedan.



<P>Kim laughed. `He is new. Run to your mothers' laps, and be safe. Come!'



<P>Kim clicked round the self-registering turnstile; the old man followed

and halted amazed. In the entrance-hall stood the larger figures of the

Greco-Buddhist sculptures done, savants know how long since, by forgotten

workmen whose hands were feeling, and not unskilfully, for the mysteriously

transmitted Grecian touch. There were hundreds of pieces, friezes of figures

in relief, fragments of statues and slabs crowded with figures that had

encrusted the brick walls of the Buddhist <I>stupas</I> and <I>viharas</I>

of the North Country and now, dug up and labelled, made the pride of the

Museum. In open-mouthed wonder the lama turned to this and that, and finally

checked in rapt attention before a large alto-relief representing a coronation

or apotheosis of the Lord Buddha. The Master was represented seated on

a lotus the petals of which were so deeply undercut as to show almost detached.

Round Him was an adoring hierarchy of kings, elders, and old-time Buddhas.

Below were lotus-covered waters with fishes and water-birds. Two butterfly-winged

<I>dewas</I> held a wreath over His head; above them another pair supported

an umbrella surmounted by the jewelled headdress of the Bodhisat.



<P>`The Lord! The Lord! It is Sakya Muni himself,' the lama half sobbed;

and under his breath began the wonderful Buddhist invocation:&nbsp;<verse type='prayer'>

<BR>To Him the Way, the Law, apart,

<BR>Whom Maya, held beneath her heart,

<BR>Ananda's Lord, the Bodhisat.



<P>`And He is here! The Most Excellent Law is here also. My pilgrimage

is well begun. And what work! What work!'



<P>`Yonder is the Sahib,' said Kim, and dodged sideways among the cases

of the arts and manufacturers wing. A white-bearded Englishman was looking

at the lama, who gravely turned and saluted him and after some fumbling

drew forth a note-book and a scrap of paper.



<P>`Yes, that is my name,' smiling at the clumsy, childish print.



<P>`One of us who had made pilgrimage to the Holy Places - he is now Abbot

of the Lung-Cho Monastery - gave it me,' stammered the lama. `He spoke

of these.' His lean hand moved tremulously round.



<P>`Welcome, then, O lama from Tibet. Here be the images, and I am here'

- he glanced at the lama's face - `to gather knowledge. Come to my office

awhile.' The old man was trembling with excitement.



<P>The office was but a little wooden cubicle partitioned off from the

sculpture-lined gallery. Kim laid himself down, his ear against a crack

in the heat-split cedar door, and, following his instinct, stretched out

to listen and watch.



<P>Most of the talk was altogether above his head. The lama, haltingly

at first, spoke to the Curator of his own lamassery, the Such-zen, opposite

the Painted Rocks, four months' march away. The Curator brought out a huge

book of photos and showed him that very place, perched on its crag, overlooking

the gigantic valley of many-hued strata.



<P>`Ay, ay!' The lama mounted a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles of Chinese

work. `Here is the little door through which we bring wood before winter.

And thou - the English know of these things? He who is now Abbot of Lung-Cho

told me, but I did not believe. The Lord - the Excellent One - He has honour

here too? And His life is known?'



<P>`It is all carven upon the stones. Come and see, if thou art rested.'



<P>Out shuffled the lama to the main hall, and, the Curator beside him,

went through the collection with the reverence of a devotee and the appreciative

instinct of a craftsman.



<P>Incident by incident in the beautiful story he identified on the blurred

stone, puzzled here and there by the unfamiliar Greek convention, but delighted

as a child at each new trove. Where the sequence failed, as in the Annunciation,

the Curator supplied it from his mound of books - French and German, with

photographs and reproductions.



<P>Here was the devout Asita, the pendant of Simeon in the Christian story,

holding the Holy Child on his knee while mother and father listened; and

here were incidents in the legend of the cousin Devadatta. Here was the

wicked woman who accused the Master of impurity, all confounded; here was

the teaching in the Deer-park; the miracle that stunned the fire-worshippers;

here was the Bodhisat in royal state as a prince; the miraculous birth;

the death at Kusinagara, where the weak disciple fainted; while there were

almost countless repetitions of the meditation under the Bodhi tree; and

the adoration of the alms-bowl was everywhere. In a few minutes the Curator

saw that his guest was no mere bead-telling mendicant, but a scholar of

parts. And they went at it all over again, the lama taking snuff, wiping

his spectacles, and talking at railway speed in a bewildering mixture of

Urdu and Tibetan. He had heard of the travels of the Chinese pilgrims,

Fu-Hiouen and Hwen-Tsiang, and was anxious to know if there was any translation

of their record. He drew in his breath as he turned helplessly over the

pages of Beal and Stanislas Julien. `'Tis all here. A treasure locked.'

Then he composed himself reverently to listen to fragments hastily rendered

into Urdu. For the first time he heard of the labours of European scholars,

who by the help of these and a hundred other documents have identified

the Holy Places of Buddhism. Then he was shown a mighty map, spotted and

traced with yellow. The brown finger followed the Curator's pencil from

point to point. Here was Kapilavastu, here the Middle Kingdom, and here

Mahabodhi, the Mecca of Buddhism; and here was Kusinagara, sad place of

the Holy One's death. The old man bowed his head over the sheets in silence

for a while, and the Curator lit another pipe. Kim had fallen asleep. When

he waked, the talk, still in spate, was more within his comprehension.



<P>`And thus it was, O Fountain of Wisdom, that I decided to go to the

Holy Places which His foot had trod - to the Birthplace, even to Kapila;

then to Mahabodhi, which is Buddh Gaya - to the Monastery - to the Deer-park

- to the place of His death.'



<P>The lama lowered his voice. `And I come here alone. For five - seven

- eighteen - forty years it was in my mind that the Old Law was not well

followed; being overlaid, as thou knowest, with devildom, charms, and idolatry.

Even as the child outside said but now. Ay, even as the child said, with

<I>b&amp;umacron;t-parasti</I>.'



<P>`So it comes with all faiths.'



<P>`Thinkest thou? The books of my lamassery I read, and they were dried

pith; and the later ritual with which we of the Reformed Law have cumbered

ourselves - that, too, had no worth to these old eyes. Even the followers

of the Excellent One are at feud on feud with one another. It is all illusion.

Ay, <I>maya</I>, illusion. But I have another desire' - the seamed yellow

face drew within three inches of the Curator, and the long forefinger-nail

tapped on the table. `Your scholars, by these books, have followed the

Blessed Feet in all their wanderings; but there are things which they have

not sought out. I know nothing - nothing do I know - but I go to free myself

from the Wheel of Things by a broad and open road.' He smiled with most

simple triumph. `As a pilgrim to the Holy Places I acquire merit. But there

is more. Listen to a true thing. When our gracious Lord, being as yet a

youth, sought a mate, men said, in His father's Court, that He was too

tender for marriage. Thou knowest?'



<P>The Curator nodded, wondering what would come next.



<P>`So they made the triple trial of strength against all comers. And at

the test of the Bow, our Lord first breaking that which they gave Him,

called for such a bow as none might bend. Thou knowest?'



<P>`It is written. I have read.'



<P>`And, overshooting all other marks, the arrow passed far and far beyond

sight. At the last it fell; and, where it touched earth, there broke out

a stream which presently became a River, whose nature, by our Lord's beneficence,

and that merit He acquired ere He freed himself, is that whoso bathes in

it washes away all taint and speckle of sin.'



<P>`So it is written,' said the Curator sadly.



<P>The lama drew a long breath. `Where is that River? Fountain of Wisdom,

where fell the arrow?'



<P>`Alas, my brother, I do not know,' said the Curator.



<P>`Nay, if it please thee to forget - the one thing only that thou hast

not told me. Surely thou must know? See, lam an old man! I ask with my

head between thy feet, O Fountain of Wisdom. We <I>know</I> He drew the

bow! We <I>know</I> the arrow fell! We <I>know</I> the stream gushed! Where,

then, is the River? My dream told me to find it. So I came. I am here.

But where is the River?'



<P>`If I knew, think you I would not cry it aloud?'



<P>`By it one attains freedom from the Wheel of Things,' the lama went

on, unheeding. `The River of the Arrow! Think again! Some little stream,

maybe - dried in the heats? But the Holy One would never so cheat an old

man.'



<P>`I do not know. I do not know.'



<P>The lama brought his thousand-wrinkled face once more a handsbreadth

from the Englishman's. `I see thou dost not know. Not being of the Law,

the matter is hid from thee.'



<P>`Ay - hidden - hidden.'



<P>`We are both bound, thou and I, my brother. But I' - he rose with a

sweep of the soft thick drapery - `I go to cut myself free. Come also!'



<P>`I am bound,' said the Curator. `But whither goest thou?'



<P>`First to Kashi [Benares]: where else? There I shall meet one of the

pure faith in a Jain temple of that city. He also is a Seeker in secret,

and from him haply I may learn. Maybe he will go with me to Buddh Gaya.

Thence north and west to Kapilavastu, and there will I seek for the River.

Nay, I will seek everywhere as I go - for the place is not known where

the arrow fell.'



<P>`And how wilt thou go? It is a far cry to Delhi, and farther to Benares.'



<P>`By road and the trains. From Path&icirc;nkot, having left the Hills,

I came hither in a <I>te-rain</I>. It goes swiftly. At first I was amazed

to see those tall poles by the side of the road snatching up and snatching

up their threads,' - he illustrated the stoop and-whirl of a telegraph-pole

flashing past the train. `But later, I was cramped and desired to walk,

as I am used.'



<P>`And thou art sure of thy road?' said the Curator.



<P>`Oh, for that one but asks a question and pays money, and the appointed

persons despatch all to the appointed place. That much I knew in my lamassery

from sure report,' said the lama proudly.



<P>`And when dost thou go?' The Curator smiled at the mixture of old-world

piety and modern progress that is the note of India today.



<P>`As soon as may be. I follow the places of His life till I come to the

River of the Arrow. There is, moreover, a written paper of the hours of

the trains that go south.'



<P>`And for food?' Lamas, as a rule, have good store of money somewhere

about them, but the Curator wished to make sure.



<P>`For the journey, I take up the Master's begging-bowl. Yes. Even as

He went so go I, forsaking the ease of my monastery. There was with me

when I left the hills a <I>chela</I> [disciple] who begged for me as the

Rule demands, but halting in Kulu awhile a fever took him and he died.

I have now no <I>chela</I>, but I will take the alms-bowl and thus enable

the charitable to acquire merit.' He nodded his head valiantly. Learned

doctors of a lamassery do not beg, but the lama was an enthusiast in this

quest.



<P>`Be it so,' said the Curator, smiling. `Suffer me now to acquire merit.

We be craftsmen together, thou and I. Here is a new book of white English

paper: here be sharpened pencils two and three - thick and thin, all good

for a scribe. Now lend me thy spectacles.'



<P>The Curator looked through them. They were heavily scratched, but the

power was almost exactly that of his own pair, which he slid into the lama's

hand, saying: `Try these.'



<P>`A feather! A very feather upon the face!' The old man turned his head

delightedly and wrinkled up his nose. `How scarcely do I feel them! How

clearly do I see!'



<P>`They be <I>bilaur</I> - crystal - and will never scratch. May they

help thee to thy River, for they are thine.'



<P>`I will take them and the pencils and the white note-book,' said the

lama, `as a sign of friendship between priest and priest - and now - '

He fumbled at his belt, detached the open-work iron pencase, and laid it

on the Curator's table. `That is for a memory between thee and me - my

pencase. It is something old - even as I am.'



<P>It was a piece of ancient design, Chinese, of an iron that is not smelted

these days; and the collector's heart in the Curator's bosom had gone out

to it from the first. For no persuasion would the lama resume his gift.



<P>`When I return, having found the River, I will bring thee a written

picture of the Padma Samthora such as I used to make on silk at the lamassery.

Yes - and of the Wheel of Life,' he chuckled, `for we be craftsmen together,

thou and I.'



<P>The Curator would have detained him: they are few in the world who still

have the secret of the conventional brush-pen Buddhist pictures which are,

as it were, half written and half drawn. But the lama strode out, head

high in air, and pausing an instant before the great statue of a Bodhisat

in meditation, brushed through the turnstiles.



<P>Kim followed like a shadow. What he had overheard excited him wildly.

This man was entirely new to all his experience, and he meant to investigate

further, precisely as he would have investigated a new building or a strange

festival in Lahore city. The lama was his trove, and he purposed to take

possession. Kim's mother had been Irish too.



<P>The old man halted by Zam-Zammah and looked round till his eye fell

on Kim. The inspiration of his pilgrimage had left him for awhile, and

he felt old, forlorn, and very empty.



<P>`Do not sit under that gun,' said the policeman loftily.



<P>`Huh! Owl!' was Kim's retort on the lama's behalf. `Sit under that gun

if it please thee. When didst thou steal the milk-woman's slippers, Dunnoo?'



<P>That was an utterly unfounded charge sprung on the spur of the moment,

but it silenced Dunnoo, who knew that Kim's clear yell could call up legions

of bad bazar boys if need arose.



<P>`And whom didst thou worship within?' said Kim affably, squatting in

the shade beside the lama.



<P>`I worshipped none, child. I bowed before the Excellent Law.'



<P>Kim accepted this new God without emotion. He knew already a few score.



<P>`And what dost thou do?'



<P>`I beg. I remember now it is long since I have eaten or drunk. What

is the custom of charity in this town? In silence, as we do of Tibet, or

speaking aloud?'



<P>`Those who beg in silence starve in silence,' said Kim, quoting a native

proverb. The lama tried to rise, but sank back again, sighing for his disciple,

dead in far-away Kulu. Kim watched - head to one side, considering and

interested.



<P>`Give me the bowl. I know the people of this city - all who are charitable.

Give, and I will bring it back filled.'



<P>Simply as a child the old man handed him the bowl.



<P>`Rest, thou. I know the people.'



<P>He trotted off to the open shop of a <I>kunjri</I>, a low-caste vegetable-seller,

which lay opposite the belt-tramway line down the Motee Bazar. She knew

Kim of old.



<P>`Oho, hast thou turned <I>yogi</I> with thy begging-bowl?' she cried.



<P>`Nay,' said Kim proudly. `There is a new priest in the city a man such

as I have never seen.'



<P>`Old priest - young tiger,' said the woman angrily. `I am tired of new

priests! They settle on our wares like flies. Is the father of my son a

well of charity to give to all who ask?'



<P>`No,' said Kim. `Thy man is rather <I>yagi</I> [bad-tempered] than <I>yogi</I>

[a holy man]. But this priest is new. The Sahib in the Wonder House has

talked to him like a brother. O my mother, fill me this bowl. He waits.'



<P>`That bowl indeed! That cow-bellied basket! Thou hast as much grace

as the holy bull of Shiv. He has taken the best of a basket of onions already,

this morn; and forsooth, I must fill thy bowl. He comes here again.'



<P>The huge, mouse-coloured Brahmini bull of the ward was shouldering his

way through the many-coloured crowd, a stolen plantain hanging out of his

mouth. He headed straight for the shop, well knowing his privileges as

a sacred beast, lowered his head, and puffed heavily along the line of

baskets ere making his choice. Up flew Kim's hard little heel and caught

him on his moist blue nose. He snorted indignantly, and walked away across

the tram-rails, his hump quivering with rage.



<P>`See! I have saved more than the bowl will cost thrice over. Now, mother,

a little rice and some dried fish atop - yes, and some vegetable curry.'



<P>A growl came out of the back of the shop, where a man lay.



<P>`He drove away the bull,' said the woman in an undertone. `It is good

to give to the poor.' She took the bowl and returned it full of hot rice.



<P>`But my <I>yogi</I> is not a cow,' said Kim gravely, making a hole with

his fingers in the top of the mound. `A little curry is good, and a fried

cake, and a morsel of conserve would please him, I think.'



<P>`It is a hole as big as thy head,' said the woman fretfully. But she

filled it, none the less, with good, steaming vegetable curry, clapped

a fried cake atop, and a morsel of clarified butter on the cake, dabbed

a lump of sour tamarind conserve at the side; and Kim looked at the load

lovingly.



<P>`That is good. When I am in the bazar the bull shall not come to this

house. He is a bold beggar-man.'



<P>`And thou?' laughed the woman. `But speak well of bulls. Hast thou not

told me that some day a Red Bull will come out of a field to help thee?

Now hold all straight and ask for the holy man's blessing upon me. Perhaps,

too, he knows a cure for my daughter's sore eyes. Ask him that also, O

thou Little Friend of all the World.'



<P>But Kim had danced off ere the end of the sentence, dodging pariah dogs

and hungry acquaintances.



<P>`Thus do we beg who know the way of it,' said he proudly to the lama,

who opened his eyes at the contents of the bowl. `Eat now and - I will

eat with thee. Oh&eacute;, <I>bhisti</I>!' he called to the water-carrier,

sluicing the crotons by the Museum. `Give water here. We men are thirsty.'



<P>`We men!' said the bhisti, laughing. `Is one skinful enough for such

a pair? Drink, then, in the name of the Compassionate.'



<P>He loosed a thin stream into Kim's hands, who drank native-fashion;

but the lama must needs pull out a cup from his inexhaustible upper draperies

and drink ceremonially.



<P>`<I>Pardesi</I> [a foreigner],' Kim explained, as the old man delivered

in an unknown tongue what was evidently a blessing.



<P>They ate together in great content, clearing the begging-bowl. Then

the lama took snuff from a portentous wooden snuff-gourd, fingered his

rosary awhile, and so dropped into the easy sleep of age, as the shadow

of Zam-Zammah grew long.



<P>Kim loafed over to the nearest tobacco-seller, a rather lively young

Mohammedan woman, and begged a rank cigar of the brand that they sell to

students of the Punjab University who copy English customs. Then he smoked

and thought, knees to chin, under the belly of the gun, and the outcome

of his thoughts was a sudden and stealthy departure in the direction of

Nila Ram's timber-yard.



<P>The lama did not wake till the evening life of the city had begun with

lamp-lighting and the return of white-robed clerks and subordinates from

the Government offices. He stared dizzily in all directions, but none looked

at him save a Hindu urchin in a dirty turban and Isabella-coloured clothes.

Suddenly he bowed his head on his knees and wailed.



<P>`What is this?' said the boy, standing before him. `Hast thou been robbed?'



<P>`It is my new <I>chela</I> [disciple] that is gone away from me, and

I know not where he is.'



<P>`And what like of man was thy disciple?'



<P>`It was a boy who came to me in place of him who died, on account of

the merit which I had gained when I bowed before the Law within there.'

He pointed towards the Museum. `He came upon me to show me a road which

I had lost. He led me into the Wonder House, and by his talk emboldened

me to speak to the Keeper of the Images, so that I was cheered and made

strong. And when I was faint with hunger he begged for me, as would a <I>chela</I>

for his teacher. Suddenly was he sent. Suddenly has he gone away. It was

in my mind to have taught him the Law upon the road to Benares.'



<P>Kim stood amazed at this, because he had overheard the talk in the Museum,

and knew that the old man was speaking the truth, which is a thing a native

on the road seldom presents to a stranger.



<P>`But I see now that he was but sent for a purpose. By this I know that

I shall find a certain River for which I seek.'



<P>`The River of the Arrow?' said Kim, with a superior smile.



<P>`Is this yet another Sending?' cried the lama. `To none have I spoken

of my search, save to the Priest of the Images. Who art thou?'



<P>`Thy <I>chela</I>,' said Kim simply, sitting on his heels. `I have never

seen anyone like to thee in all this my life. I go with thee to Benares.

And, too, I think that so old a man as thou, speaking the truth to chance-met

people at dusk, is in great need of a disciple.'



<P>`But the River - the River of the Arrow?'



<P>`Oh, that I heard when thou wast speaking to the Englishman. I lay against

the door.'



<P>The lama sighed. `I thought thou hadst been a guide permitted. Such

things fall sometimes - but I am not worthy. Thou dost not then, know the

River?'



<P>`Not I.' Kim laughed uneasily. `I go to look for - for a bull - a Red

Bull on a green field who shall help me.' Boylike, if an acquaintance had

a scheme, Kim was quite ready with one of his own; and, boylike, he had

really thought for as much as twenty minutes at a time of his father's

prophecy.



<P>`To what, child?' said the lama.



<P>`God knows, but so my father told me. I heard thy talk in the Wonder

House of all those new strange places in the Hills, and if one so old and

so little - so used to truth-telling - may go out for the small matter

of a river, it seemed to me that I too must go a-travelling. If it is our

fate to find those things we shall find them - thou, thy River; and I,

my Bull, and the Strong Pillars and some other matters that I forget.'



<P>`It is not pillars but a Wheel from which I would be free,' said the

lama.



<P>`That is all one. Perhaps they will make me a king,' said Kim, serenely

prepared for anything.



<P>`I will teach thee other and better desires upon the road,' the lama

replied in the voice of authority. `Let us go to Benares.'



<P>`Not by night. Thieves are abroad. Wait till the day.'



<P>`But there is no place to sleep.' The old man was used to the order

of his monastery, and though he slept on the ground, as the Rule decrees,

preferred a decency in these things.



<P>`We shall get good lodging at the Kashmir Serai,' said Kim, laughing

at his perplexity. `I have a friend there. Come!'



<P>The hot and crowded bazars blazed with light as they made their way

through the press of all the races in Upper India, and the lama mooned

through it like a man in a dream. It was his first experience of a large

manufacturing city, and the crowded tram-car with its continually squealing

brakes frightened him. Half pushed, half towed, he arrived at the high

gate of the Kashmir Serai: that huge open square over against the railway

station, surrounded with arched cloisters, where the camel and horse caravans

put up on their return from Central Asia. Here were all manner of Northern

folk, tending tethered ponies and kneeling camels; loading and unloading

bales and bundles; drawing water for the evening meal at the creaking well-windlasses;

piling grass before the shrieking, wild-eyed stallions; cuffing the surly

caravan dogs; paying off camel-drivers; taking on new grooms; swearing,

shouting, arguing, and chaffering in the packed square. The cloisters,

reached by three or four masonry steps, made a haven of refuge around this

turbulent sea. Most of them were rented to traders, as we rent the arches

of a viaduct; the space between pillar and pillar being bricked or boarded

off into rooms, which were guarded by heavy wooden doors and cumbrous native

padlocks. Locked doors showed that the owner was away, and a few rude -

sometimes very rude - chalk or paint scratches told where he had gone.

Thus: `Lutuf Ullah is gone to Kurdistan.' Below, in coarse verse: `O Allah,

who sufferest lice to live on the coat of a Kabuli, why hast thou allowed

this louse Lutuf to live so long?'



<P>Kim, fending the lama between excited men and excited beasts, sidled

along the cloisters to the far end, nearest the railway station, where

Mahbub Ali, the horse-trader, lived when he came in from that mysterious

land beyond the Passes of the North.



<P>Kim had had many dealings with Mahbub in his little life, - especially

between his tenth and his thirteenth year - and the big burly Afghan, his

beard dyed scarlet with lime (for he was elderly and did not wish his grey

hairs to show), knew the boy's value as a gossip. Sometimes he would tell

Kim to watch a man who had nothing whatever to do with horses: to follow

him for one whole day and report every soul with whom he talked. Kim would

deliver himself of his tale at evening, and Mahbub would listen without

a word or gesture. It was intrigue of some kind, Kim knew; but its worth

lay in saying nothing whatever to anyone except Mahbub, who gave him beautiful

meals all hot from the cookshop at the head of the serai, and once as much

as eight annas in money.



<P>`He is here,' said Kim, hitting a bad-tempered camel on the nose. `Ohe,

Mahbub Ali!' He halted at a dark arch and slipped behind the bewildered

lama.



<P>The horse-trader, his deep, embroidered Bokhariot belt unloosed, was

lying on a pair of silk carpet saddle-bags, pulling lazily at an immense

silver hookah. He turned his head very slightly at the cry; and seeing

only the tall silent figure, chuckled in his deep chest.



<P>`Allah! A lama! A Red Lama! It is far from Lahore to the Passes. What

dost thou do here?'



<P>The lama held out the begging-bowl mechanically.



<P>`God's curse on all unbelievers!' said Mahbub. `I do not give to a lousy

Tibetan; but ask my Baltis over yonder behind the camels. They may value

your blessings. Oh, horseboys, here is a countryman of yours. See if he

be hungry.'



<P>A shaven, crouching Balti, who had come down with the horses, and who

was nominally some sort of degraded Buddhist, fawned upon the priest, and

in thick gutturals besought the Holy One to sit at the horseboys' fire.



<P>`Go!' said Kim, pushing him lightly, and the lama strode away, leaving

Kim at the edge of the cloister.



<P>`Go!' said Mahbub Ali, returning to his hookah. `Little Hindu, run away.

God's curse on all unbelievers! Beg from those of my tail who are of thy

faith.'



<P>`<I>Maharaj</I>,' whined Kim, using the Hindu form of address, and thoroughly

enjoying the situation; `my father is dead - my mother is dead - my stomach

is empty.'



<P>`Beg from my men among the horses, I say. There must be some Hindus

in my tail.'



<P>`Oh, Mahbub Ali, but am <I>I</I> a Hindu?' said Kim in English.



<P>The trader gave no sign of astonishment, but looked under shaggy eyebrows.



<P>`Little Friend of all the World,' said he, `what is this?'



<P>`Nothing. I am now that holy man's disciple; and we go a pilgrimage

together - to Benares, he says. He is quite mad, and I am tired of Lahore

city. I wish new air and water.'



<P>`But for whom dost thou work? Why come to me?' The voice was harsh with

suspicion.



<P>`To whom else should I come? I have no money. It is not good to go about

without money. Thou wilt sell many horses to the officers. They are very

fine horses, these new ones: I have seen them. Give me a rupee, Mahbub

Ali, and when I come to my wealth I will give thee a bond and pay.'



<P>`Um!' said Mahbub Ali, thinking swiftly. `Thou hast never before lied

to me. Call that lama - stand back in the dark.'



<P>`Oh, our tales will agree,' said Kim, laughing.



<P>`We go to Benares,' said the lama, as soon as he understood the drift

of Mahbub Ali's questions. `The boy and I, I go to seek for a certain River.'



<P>`Maybe - but the boy?'



<P>`He is my disciple. He was sent, I think, to guide me to that River.

Sitting under a gun was I when he came suddenly. Such things have befallen

the fortunate to whom guidance was allowed. But I remember now, he said

he was of this world - a Hindu.'



<P>`And his name?'



<P>`That I did not ask. Is he not my disciple?'



<P>`His country - his race - his village? Mussalman Sikh - Hindu - Jain

- low caste or high?'



<P>`Why should I ask? There is neither high nor low in the Middle Way.

If he is my <I>chela</I> - does - will - can anyone take him from me? for,

look you, without him I shall not find my River.' He wagged his head solemnly.



<P>`None shall take him from thee. Go, sit among my Baltis,' said Mahbub

Ali, and the lama drifted off' soothed by the promise.



<P>`Is he not quite mad?' said Kim, coming forward to the light again.

`Why should I lie to thee, <I>Hajji</I>?'



<P>Mahbub puffed his hookah in silence. Then he began, almost whispering:

`Umballa is on the road to Benares - if indeed ye two go there.'



<P>`Tck! Tck! I tell thee he does not know how to lie - as we two know.'



<P>`And if thou wilt carry a message for me as far as Umballa, I will give

thee money. It concerns a horse - a white stallion which I have sold to

an officer upon the last time I returned from the Passes. But then - stand

nearer and hold up hands as begging - the pedigree of the white stallion

was not fully established, and that officer, who is now at Umballa, bade

me make it clear.' (Mahbub here described the horse and the appearance

of the officer.) `So the message to that officer will be: `The pedigree

of the white stallion is fully established.' By this will he know that

thou comest from me. He will then say `What proof hast thou?' and thou

wilt answer: `Mahbub Ali has given me the proof.''



<P>`And all for the sake of a white stallion,' said Kim, with a giggle,

his eyes aflame.



<P>`That pedigree I will give thee now - in my own fashion - and some hard

words as well.' A shadow passed behind Kim, and a feeding camel. Mahbub

Ali raised his voice.



<P>`Allah! Art thou the only beggar in the city? Thy mother is dead. Thy

father is dead. So is it with all of them. Well, well - ' He turned as

feeling on the floor beside him and tossed a flap of soft, greasy Mussalman

bread to the boy. `Go and lie down among my horseboys for to-night - thou

and the lama. Tomorrow I may give thee service.'



<P>Kim slunk away, his teeth in the bread, and, as he expected, he found

a small wad of folded tissue-paper wrapped in oil-skin, with three silver

rupees - enormous largesse. He smiled and thrust money and paper into his

leather amulet-case. The lama, sumptuously fed by Mahbub's Baltis, was

already asleep in a corner of one of the stalls. Kim lay down beside him

and laughed. He knew he had rendered a service to Mahbub Ali, and not for

one little minute did he believe the tale of the stallion's pedigree.



<P>But Kim did not suspect that Mahbub Ali, known as one of the best horse-dealers

in the Punjab, a wealthy and enterprising trader, whose caravans penetrated

far and far into the Back of Beyond, was registered in one of the locked

books of the Indian Survey Department as C251B. Twice or thrice yearly

C25 would send in a little story, baldly told but most interesting, and

generally - it was checked by the statements of R17 and M4 - quite true.

It concerned all manner of out-of-the-way mountain principalities, explorers

of nationalities other than English, and the gun-trade - was, in brief,

a small portion of that vast mass of <I>information received</I> on which

the Indian Government acts. But, recently, five confederated Kings, who

had no business to confederate, had been informed by a kindly Northern

Power that there was a leakage of news from their territories into British

India. So those Kings' Prime Ministers were seriously annoyed and took

steps, after the Oriental fashion. They suspected, among many others, the

bullying, red-bearded horse-dealer whose caravans ploughed through their

fastnesses belly-deep in snow. At least, his caravan that season had been

ambushed and shot at twice on the way down, when Mahbub's men accounted

for three strange ruffians who might, or might not, have been hired for

the job. Therefore Mahbub had avoided halting at the insalubrious city

of Peshawur, and had come through without stop to Lahore, where, knowing

his country-people, he anticipated curious developments.



<P>And there was that on Mahbub Ali which he did not wish to keep an hour

longer than was necessary - a wad of closely folded tissue-paper, wrapped

in oilskin - an impersonal, unaddressed statement, with five microscopic

pin-holes in one corner, that most scandalously betrayed the five confederated

Kings, the sympathetic Northern Power, a Hindu banker in Peshawur, a firm

of gun-makers in Belgium, and an important, semi-independent Mohammedan

ruler to the south. This last was R17's work, which Mahbub had picked up

beyond the Dora Pass and was carrying in for R17, who, owing to circumstances

over which he had no control, could not leave his post of observation.

Dynamite was milky and innocuous beside that report of C25; and even an

Oriental, with an Oriental's views of the value of time, could see that

the sooner it was in the proper hands the better. Mahbub had no particular

desire to die by violence, because two or three family blood-feuds across

the Border hung unfinished on his hands, and when these scores were cleared

he intended to settle down as a more or less virtuous citizen. He had never

passed the serai gate since his arrival two days ago, but had been ostentatious

in sending telegrams to Bombay, where he banked some of his money; to Delhi,

where a sub-partner of his own clan was selling horses to the agent of

a Rajputana state; and to Umballa, where an Englishman was excitedly demanding

the pedigree of a white stallion. The public letter-writer, who knew English,

composed excellent telegrams, such as:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Creighton, Laurel Bank, Umballa. Horse is Arabian as already

advised. Sorrowful delayed pedigree which am translating</BLOCKQUOTE>

. And later to the same address:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Much sorrowful delay. Will forward pedigree</BLOCKQUOTE>

. To his sub-partner at Delhi he wired:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Lutuf Ullah. Have wired two thousand rupees your credit Luchman

Narain's bank.</BLOCKQUOTE>

This was entirely in the way of trade, but every one of those telegrams

was discussed and re-discussed, by parties who conceived themselves to

be interested, before they went over to the railway station in charge of

a foolish Balti, who allowed all sorts of people to read them on the road.



<P>When, in Mahbub's own picturesque language, he had muddied the wells

of inquiry with the stick of precaution, Kim had dropped on him, sent from

Heaven; and, being as prompt as he was unscrupulous, Mahbub Ali, used to

taking all sorts of gusty chances, pressed him into service on the spot.



<P>A wandering lama with a low-caste boy-servant might attract a moment's

interest as they wandered about India, the land of pilgrims; but no one

would suspect them or, what was more to the point, rob.



<P>He called for a new light-ball to his hookah, and considered the case.

If the worst came to the worst, and the boy came to harm, the paper would

incriminate nobody. And he would go up to Umballa leisurely and - at a

certain risk of exciting fresh suspicion - repeat his tale by word of mouth

to the people concerned.



<P>But R17's report was the kernel of the whole affair, and it would be

distinctly inconvenient if that failed to come to hand. However, God was

great, and Mahbub Ali felt he had done all he could for the time being.

Kim was the one soul in the world who had never told him a lie. That would

have been a fatal blot on Kim's character if Mahbub had not known that

to others, for his own ends or Mahbub's business, Kim could lie like an

Oriental.



<P>Then Mahbub Ali rolled across the serai to the Gate of the Harpies who

paint their eyes and trap the stranger, and was at some pains to call on

the one girl who, he had reason to believe, was a particular friend of

a smooth-faced Kashmiri <I>pundit</I> who had waylaid his simple Balti

in the matter of the telegrams. It was an utterly foolish thing to do;

because they fell to drinking perfumed brandy against the Law of the Prophet,

and Mahbub grew wonderfully drunk, and the gates of his mouth were loosened,

and he pursued the Flower of Delight with the feet of intoxication till

he fell flat among the cushions, where the Flower of Delight, aided by

a smooth-faced Kashmiri <I>pundit</I>, searched him from head to foot most

thoroughly.



<P>About the same hour Kim heard soft feet in Mahbub's deserted stall.

The horse-trader, curiously enough, had left his door unlocked, and his

men were busy celebrating their return to India with a whole sheep of Mahbub's

bounty. A sleek young gentleman from Delhi, armed with a bunch of keys

which the Flower had unshackled from the senseless one's belt, went through

every single box, bundle, mat, and saddle-bag in Mahbub's possession even

more systematically than the Flower and the <I>pundit</I> were searching

the owner.



<P>`And I think,' said the Flower scornfully an hour later, one rounded

elbow on the snoring carcass, `that he is no more than a pig of an Afghan

horse-dealer, with no thought except women and horses. Moreover, he may

have sent it away by now - if ever there were such a thing.'



<P>`Nay - in a matter touching Five Kings it would be next his black heart,'

said the pundit. `Was there nothing?'



<P>The Delhi man laughed and resettled his turban as he entered. `I searched

between the soles of his slippers as the Flower searched his clothes. This

is not the man but another. I leave little unseen.'



<P>`They did not say he was the very man,' said the pundit thoughtfully.

`They said, `Look if he be the man, since our counsels are troubled.''



<P>`That North country is full of horse-dealers as an old coat of lice.

There is Sikandar Khan, Nur Ali Beg, and Farrukh Shah - all heads of <I>kafilas</I>

[caravans] - who deal there,' said the Flower.



<P>`They have not yet come in,' said the pundit. `Thou must ensnare them

later.'



<P>`Phew!' said the Flower with deep disgust, rolling Mahbub's head from

her lap. `I earn my money. Farrukh Shah is a bear, Ali Beg a swashbuckler,

and old Sikandar Khan - yaie! Go! I sleep now. This swine will not stir

till dawn.'



<P>When Mahbub woke, the Flower talked to him severely on the sin of drunkenness.

Asiatics do not wink when they have outmanoeuvred an enemy, but as Mahbub

Ali cleared his throat, tightened his belt, and staggered forth under the

early morning stars, he came very near to it.



<P>`What a colt's trick!' said he to himself. `As if every girl in Peshawur

did not use it! But 'twas prettily done. Now God He knows how many more

there be upon the Road who have orders to test me - perhaps with the knife.

So it stands that the boy must go to Umballa - and by rail - for the writing

is something urgent. I abide here, following the Flower and drinking wine

as an Afghan coper should.'



<P>He halted at the stall next but one to his own. His men lay there heavy

with sleep. There was no sign of Kim or the lama.



<P>`Up!' He stirred a sleeper. `Whither went those who lay here last even

- the lama and the boy? Is aught missing?'



<P>`Nay,' grunted the man, `the old madman rose at second cockcrow saying

he would go to Benares, and the young one led him away.'



<P>`The curse of Allah on all unbelievers!' said Mahbub heartily, and climbed

into his own stall, growling in his beard.



<P>But it was Kim who had wakened the lama - Kim with one eye laid against

a knot-hole in the planking, who had seen the Delhi man's search through

the boxes. This was no common thief that turned over letters, bills, and

saddles - no mere burglar who ran a little knife sideways into the soles

of Mahbub's slippers, or picked the seams of the saddle-bags so deftly.

At first Kim had been minded to give the alarm - the long-drawn <I>cho-or</I>

- <I>choor</I>! [thief! thief!] that sets the serai ablaze of nights; but

he looked more carefully, and, hand on amulet, drew his own conclusions.



<P>`It must be the pedigree of that made-up horse-lie,' said he, `the thing

that I carry to Umballa. Better that we go now. Those who search bags with

knives may presently search bellies with knives. Surely there is a woman

behind this. Hai! Hai!' in a whisper to the light-sleeping old man. `Come.

It is time - time to go to Benares.'



<P>The lama rose obediently, and they passed out of the serai like shadows.

<P>Your tiercel's' too long at hack, Sire. He's no eyass

<BR>But a passage-hawk that footed ere we caught him,

<BR>Dangerously free o' the air. Faith! were he mine

<BR>(As mine's the glove he binds to for his tirings)

<BR>I'd fly him with a make-hawk. He's in yarak

<BR>Plumed to the very point - so manned, so weathered...

<BR>Give him the firmament God made him for,

<BR>And what shall take the air of him?



<P><I>Cow's Watch</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

Lurgan Sahib did not use as direct speech, but his advice tallied with

Mahbub's; and the upshot was good for Kim. He knew better now than to leave

Lucknow city in native garb, and if Mahbub were anywhere within reach of

a letter, it was to Mahbub's camp he headed, and made his change under

the Pathan's wary eye. Could the little Survey paint-box that he used for

map-tinting in term-time have found a tongue to tell of holiday doings,

he might have been expelled. Once Mahbub and he went together as far as

the beautiful city of Bombay, with three truckloads of tram-horses, and

Mahbub nearly melted when Kim proposed a sail in a dhow across the Indian

Ocean to buy Gulf Arabs, which, he understood from a hanger-on of the dealer

Abdul Rahman, fetched better prices than mere Kabulis.



<P>He dipped his hand into the dish with that great trader when Mahbub

and a few co-religionists were invited to a big Haj dinner. They came back

by way of Karachi by sea, when Kim took his first experience of sea-sickness

sitting on the fore-hatch of a coasting-steamer, well persuaded he had

been poisoned. The Babu's famous drug-box proved useless, though Kim had

restocked it at Bombay. Mahbub had business at Quetta, and there Kim, as

Mahbub admitted, earned his keep, and perhaps a little over, by spending

four curious days as scullion in the house of a fat Commissariat sergeant,

from whose office-box, in an auspicious moment, he removed a little vellum

ledger which he copied out - it seemed to deal entirely with cattle and

camel sales - by moonlight, lying behind an outhouse, all through one hot

night. Then he returned the ledger to its place, and, at Mahbub's word,

left that service unpaid, rejoining him six miles down the road, the clean

copy in his bosom.



<P>`That soldier is a small fish,' Mahbub Ali explained, `but in time we

shall catch the larger one. He only sells oxen at two prices - one for

himself and one for the Government - which I do not think is a sin.'



<P>`Why could not I take away the little book and be done with it?'



<P>`Then he would have been frightened, and he would have told his master.

Then we should miss, perhaps, a great number of new rifles which seek their

way up from Quetta to the North. The Game is so large that one sees but

a little at a time.'



<P>`Oho!' said Kim, and held his tongue. That was in the monsoon holidays,

after he had taken the prize for mathematics. The Christmas holidays he

spent - deducting ten days for private amusements - with Lurgan Sahib,

where he sat for the most part in front of a roaring wood-fire - Jakko

road was four feet deep in snow that year - and - the small Hindu had gone

away to be married - helped Lurgan to thread pearls. He made Kim learn

whole chapters of the Koran by heart, till he could deliver them with the

very roll and cadence of a mullah. Moreover, he told Kim the names and

properties of many native drugs, as well as the runes proper to recite

when you administer them. And in the evenings he wrote charms on parchment

- elaborate pentagrams crowned with the names of devils - Murra, and Awan

the Companion of Kings - all fantastically written in the corners. More

to the point, he advised Kim as to the care of his own body, the cure of

fever-fits, and simple remedies of the Road. A week before it was time

to go down, Colonel Creighton Sahib - this was unfair - sent Kim a written

examination-paper that concerned itself solely with rods and chains and

links and angles.



<P>Next holidays he was out with Mahbub, and here, by the way, he nearly

died of thirst, plodding through the sand on a camel to the mysterious

city of Bikanir, where the wells are four hundred feet deep, and lined

throughout with camel-bone. It was not an amusing trip from Kim's point

of view, because - in defiance of the contract - the Colonel ordered him

to make a map of that wild, walled city; and since Mohammedan horse-boys

and pipe-tenders are not expected to drag Survey-chains round the capital

of an independent Native State, Kim was forced to pace all his distances

by means of a bead rosary. He used the compass for bearings as occasion

served - after dark chiefly, when the camels had been fed - and by the

help of his little Survey paint-box of six colour-cakes and three brushes,

he achieved something not remotely unlike the city of Jeysulmir. Mahbub

laughed a great deal, and advised him to make up a written report as well;

and in the back of the big account-book that lay under the flap of Mahbub's

pet saddle Kim fell to work.



<P>`It must hold everything that thou hast seen or touched or considered.

Write as though the Jung-i-Lat Sahib himself had come by stealth with a

vast army outsetting to war.'



<P>`How great an army?'



<P>`Oh, half a lakh of men.'



<P>`Folly! Remember how few and bad were the wells in the sand. Not a thousand

thirsty men could come near by here.'



<P>`Then write that down - also all the old breaches in the walls and whence

the firewood is cut - and what is the temper and disposition of the King.

I stay here till all my horses are sold. I will hire a room by the gateway,

and thou shalt be my accountant. There is a good lock to the door.'



<P>The report in its unmistakable St Xavier's running script, and the brown,

yellow, and lake-daubed map, was on hand a few years ago (a careless clerk

filed it with the rough notes of E23's second Seistan survey), but by now

the pencil characters must be almost illegible. Kim translated it, sweating

under the light of an oil-lamp, to Mahbub, the second day of their return-journey.

The Pathan rose and stooped over his dappled saddle-bags.



<P>`I knew it would be worthy a dress of honour, and so I made one ready,'

he said, smiling. `Were I Amir of Afghanistan (and some day we may see

him), I would fill thy mouth with gold.' He laid the garments formally

at Kim's feet. There was a gold-embroidered Peshawur turban-cap, rising

to a cone, and a big turban-cloth ending in a broad fringe of gold. There

was a Delhi embroidered waistcoat to slip over a milky white shirt, fastening

to the right, ample and flowing; green pyjamas with twisted silk waist-string;

and that nothing might be lacking, russia-leather slippers, smelling divinely,

with arrogantly curled tips.



<P>`Upon a Wednesday, and in the morning, to put on new clothes is auspicious,'

said Mahbub solemnly. `But we must not forget the wicked folk in the world.

So!'



<P>He capped all the splendour, that was taking Kim's delighted breath

away, with a mother-of-pearl, nickel-plated, self-extracting .450 revolver.



<P>`I had thought of a smaller bore, but reflected that this takes Government

bullets. A man can always come by those - especially across the Border.

Stand up and let me look.' He clapped Kim on the shoulder. `May you never

be tired, Pathan! Oh, the hearts to be broken! Oh, the eyes under the eyelashes,

looking sideways!'



<P>Kim turned about, pointed his toes, stretched, and felt mechanically

for the moustache that was just beginning. Then he stooped towards Mahbub's

feet to make proper acknowledgment with fluttering, quick-patting hands;

his heart too full for words. Mahbub forestalled and embraced him.



<P>`My son' said he, `what need of words between us? But is not the little

gun a delight? All six cartridges come out at one twist. It is borne in

the bosom next the skin, which, as it were, keeps it ogled. Never put it

elsewhere, and please God, thou shalt some day kill a man with it.'



<P>`<I>Hai mai</I>!' said Kim ruefully. `If a Sahib kills a man he is hanged

in the jail.'



<P>`True: but one pace beyond the Border, men are wiser. Put it away; but

fill it first. Of what use is a gun unfed?'



<P>`When I go back to the <I>madrissah</I> I must return it. They do not

allow little guns. Thou wilt keep it for me?'



<P>`Son, I am wearied of that <I>madrissah</I>, where they take the best

years of a man to teach him what he can only learn upon the Road. The folly

of the Sahibs has neither top nor bottom. No matter. Maybe thy written

report shall save thee further bondage; and God He knows we need men more

and more in the Game.'



<P>They marched, jaw-bound against blowing sand, across the salt desert

to Jodhpur, where Mahbub and his handsome nephew Habib Ullah did much trading;

and then sorrowfully, in European clothes, which he was fast outgrowing,

Kim went second-class to St Xavier's. Three weeks later, Colonel Creighton,

pricing Tibetan ghost-daggers at Lurgan's shop, faced Mahbub Ali openly

mutinous. Lurgan Sahib operated as support in reserve.



<P>`The pony is made - finished - mouthed and paced, Sahib! From now on,

day by day, he will lose his manners if he is kept at tricks. Drop the

rein on his back and let go,' said the horse-dealer. `We need him.'



<P>`But he is so young, Mahbub - not more than sixteen - is he?'



<P>`When I was fifteen, I had shot my man and begot my man, Sahib.'



<P>`You impenitent old heathen!' Creighton turned to Lurgan. The black

beard nodded assent to the wisdom of the Afghan's dyed scarlet.



<P>`I should have used him long ago,' said Lurgan. `The younger the better.

That is why I always have my really valuable jewels watched by a child.

You sent him to me to try. I tried him in every way: he is the only boy

I could not make to see things.'



<P>`In the crystal - in the ink-pool?' demanded Mahbub.



<P>`No. Under my hand, as I told you. That has never happened before. It

means that he is strong enough - but you think it skittles, Colonel Creighton

- to make anyone do anything he wants. And that is three years ago. I have

taught him a good deal since, Colonel Creighton. I think you waste him

now.'



<P>`Hmm! Maybe you're right. But, as you know, there is no Survey work

for him at present.'



<P>`Let him out - let him go,' Mahbub interrupted. `Who expects any colt

to carry heavy weight at first? Let him run with the caravans - like our

white camel-colts - for luck. I would take him myself; but - '



<P>`There is a little business where he would be most useful - in the South,'

said Lurgan, with peculiar suavity, dropping his heavy blued eyelids.



<P>`E23 has that in hand,' said Creighton quickly. `He must not go down

there. Besides, he knows no Turki.'



<P>`Only tell him the shape and the smell of the letters we want and he

will bring them back,' Lurgan insisted.



<P>`No. That is a man's job,' said Creighton.



<P>It was a wry-necked matter of unauthorized and incendiary correspondence

between a person who claimed to be the ultimate authority in all matters

of the Mohammedan religion throughout the world, and a younger member of

a royal house who had been brought to book for kidnapping women within

British territory. The Moslem Archbishop had been emphatic and over-arrogant;

the young prince was merely sulky at the curtailment of his privileges,

but there was no need he should continue a correspondence which might some

day compromise him. One letter indeed had been procured, but the finder

was later found dead by the roadside in the habit of an Arab trader, as

E23, taking up the work, duly reported.



<P>These facts, and a few others not to be published, made both Mahbub

and Creighton shake their heads.



<P>`Let him go out with his Red Lama,' said the horse-dealer with visible

effort. `He is fond of the old man. He can learn his paces by the rosary

at least.'



<P>`I have had some dealings with the old man - by letter,' said Colonel

Creighton, smiling to himself. `Whither goes he?'



<P>`Up and down the land, as he has these three years. He seeks a River

of Healing. God's curse upon all - ' Mahbub checked himself. `He beds down

at the Temple of the Tirthankars or at Buddh Gaya when he is in from the

Road. Then he goes to see the boy at the <I>madrissah</I>, as we know for

the boy was punished for it twice or thrice. He is quite mad, but a peaceful

man. I have met him. The Babu also has had dealings with him. We have watched

him for three years. Red Lamas are not so common in Hind that one loses

track.'



<P>`Babus are very curious,' said Lurgan meditatively. `Do you know what

Hurree Babu really wants? He wants to be made a member of the Royal Society

by taking ethnological notes. I tell you, I tell him about the lama everything

which Mahbub and the boy have told me. Hurree Babu goes down to Benares

- at his own expense, I think.'



<P>`I don't,' said Creighton briefly. He had paid Hurree's travelling expenses,

out of a most lively curiosity to learn what the lama might be.



<P>`And he applies to the lama for information on lamaism, and devil-dances,

and spells and charms, several times in these few years. Holy Virgin! I

could have told him all that yeears ago. I think Hurree Babu is getting

too old for the Road. He likes better to collect manners and customs information.

Yes, he wants to be an FRS.'



<P>`Hurree thinks well of the boy, doesn't he?'



<P>`Oh, very indeed - we have had some pleasant evenings at my little place

- but I think it would be waste to throw him away with Hurree on the Ethnological

side.'



<P>`Not for a first experience. How does that strike you, Mahbub? Let the

boy run with the lama for six months. After that we can see. He will get

experience.'



<P>`He has it already, Sahib - as a fish controls the water he swims in.

But for every reason it will be well to loose him from the school.'



<P>`Very good, then,' said Creighton, half to himself. `He can go with

the lama, and if Hurree Babu cares to keep an eye on them so much the better.

He won't lead the boy into any danger as Mahbub would. Curious - his wish

to be an FRS. Very human, too. He <I>is</I> best on the Ethnological side

- Hurree.'



<P>No money and no preferment would have drawn Creighton from his work

on the Indian Survey, but deep in his heart also lay the ambition to write

<I>F R S</I> after his name. Honours of a sort he knew could be obtained

by ingenuity and the help of friends, but, to the best of his belief; nothing

save work - papers representing a life of it - took a man into the Society

which he had bombarded for years with monographs on strange Asiatic cults

and unknown customs. Nine men out of ten would flee from a Royal Society

soiree in extremity of boredom; but Creighton was the tenth, and at times

his soul yearned for the crowded rooms in easy London where silver-haired,

baldheaded gentlemen who know nothing of the Army move among spectroscopic

experiments, the lesser plants of the frozen tundras, electric flight-measuring

machines, and apparatus for slicing into fractional millimetres the left

eye of the female mosquito. By all right and reason, it was the Royal Geographical

that should have appealed to him, but men are as chancy as children in

their choice of playthings. So Creighton smiled, and thought the better

of Hurree Babu, moved by like desire.



<P>He dropped the ghost-dagger and looked up at Mahbub.



<P>`How soon can we get the colt from the stable?' said the horse-dealer,

reading his eyes.



<P>`Hmm! If I withdraw him by order now - what will he do, think you? I

have never before assisted at the teaching of such an one.'



<P>`He will come to me,' said Mahbub promptly. `Lurgan Sahib and I will

prepare him for the Road.'



<P>`So be it, then. For six months he shall run at his choice. But who

will be his sponsor?'



<P>Lurgan slightly inclined his head. `He will not tell anything, if that

is what you are afraid of; Colonel Creighton.'



<P>`It's only a boy, after all.'



<P>`Ye-es; but first, he has nothing to tell; and secondly, he knows what

would happen. Also, he is very fond of Mahbub, and of me a little.'



<P>`Will he draw pay?' demanded the practical horse-dealer.



<P>`Food and water allowance only. Twenty rupees a month.'



<P>One advantage of the Secret Service is that it has no worrying audit.

That Service is ludicrously starved, of course, but the funds are administered

by a few men who do not call for vouchers or present itemized accounts.

Mahbub's eyes lighted with almost a Sikh's love of money. Even Lurgan's

impassive face changed. He considered the years to come when Kim would

have been entered and made to the Great Game that never ceases day and

night, throughout India. He foresaw honour and credit in the mouths of

a chosen few, coming to him from his pupil. Lurgan Sahib had made E23 what

E23 was, out of a bewildered, impertinent, lying, little North-West Province

man.



<P>But the joy of these masters was pale and smoky beside the joy of Kim

when St Xavier's Head called him aside, with word that Colonel Creighton

had sent for him.



<P>`I understand, O'Hara, that he has found you a place as an assistant

chain-man in the Canal Department: that comes of taking up mathematics.

It is great luck for you, for you are only sixteen; but of course you understand

that you do not become <I>pukka</I> [permanent] till you have passed the

autumn examination. So you must not think you are going out into the world

to enjoy yourself; or that your fortune is made. There is a great deal

of hard work before you. Only, if you succeed in becoming <I>pukka</I>,

you can rise, you know, to four hundred and fifty a month.' Whereat the

Principal gave him much good advice as to his conduct, and his manners,

and his morals; and others, his elders, who had not been wafted into billets,

talked as only Anglo-Indian lads can, of favouritism and corruption. Indeed,

young Cazalet, whose father was a pensioner at Chunar, hinted very broadly

that Colonel Creighton's interest in Kim was directly paternal; and Kim,

instead of retaliating, did not even use language. He was thinking of the

immense fun to come, of Mahbub's letter of the day before, all neatly written

in English, making appointment for that afternoon in a house the very name

of which would have crisped the Principal's hair with horror...



<P>Said Kim to Mahbub in Lucknow railway station that evening, above the

luggage-scales: `I feared lest, at the last, the roof would fall upon me

and cheat me. It is indeed all finished, O my father?'



<P>Mahbub snapped his fingers to show the utterness of that end, and his

eyes blazed like red coals.



<P>`Then where is the pistol that I may wear it?'



<P>`Softly! A half-year, to run without heel-ropes. I begged that much

from Colonel Creighton Sahib. At twenty rupees a month. Old Red Hat knows

that thou art coming.'



<P>`I will pay thee <I>dustoorie</I> [commission] on my pay for three months,'

said Kim gravely. `Yea, two rupees a month. But first we must get rid of

these.' He plucked his thin linen trousers and dragged at his collar. `I

have brought with me all that I need on the Road. My trunk has gone up

to Lurgan Sahib's.'



<P>`Who sends his salaams to thee - Sahib.'



<P>`Lurgan Sahib is a very clever man. But what dost thou do?'



<P>`I go North again, upon the Great Game. What else? Is thy mind still

set on following old Red Hat?'



<P>`Do not forget he made me that I am - though he did not know it. Year

by year, he sent the money that taught me.'



<P>`I would have done as much - had it struck my thick head,' Mahbub growled.

`Come away. The lamps are lit now, and none will mark thee in the bazar.

We go to Huneefa's house.'



<P>On the way thither, Mahbub gave him much the same sort of advice as

his mother gave to Lemuel, and curiously enough, Mahbub was exact to point

out how Huneefa and her likes destroyed kings.



<P>`And I remember,' he quoted maliciously, `one who said, `Trust a snake

before an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan, Mahbub Ali.' Now, excepting

as to Pathans, of whom I am one, all that is true. Most true is it in the

Great Game, for it is by means of women that all plans come to ruin and

we lie out in the dawning with our throats cut. So it happened to such

a one.' He gave the reddest particulars.



<P>`Then why - ?' Kim paused before a filthy staircase that climbed to

the warm darkness of an upper chamber, in the ward that is behind Azim

Ullah's tobacco-shop. Those who know it call it The Birdcage - it is so

full of whisperings and whistlings and chirrupings.



<P>The room, with its dirty cushions and half-smoked hookahs, smelt abominably

of stale tobacco. In one corner lay a huge and shapeless-woman clad in

greenish gauzes, and decked, brow, nose, ear, neck, wrist, arm, waist,

and ankle with heavy native jewellery. When she turned it was like the

clashing of copper



<P>Pots. A lean cat in the balcony outside the window mewed hungrily. Kim

checked, bewildered, at the door-curtain.



<P>`Is that the new stuff, Mahbub?' said Huneefa lazily, scarce troubling

to remove the mouthpiece from her lips. `O Buktanoos!' - like most of her

kind, she swore by the Djinns - `O Buktanoos! He is very good to look upon.'



<P>`That is part of the selling of the horse,' Mahbub explained to Kim,

who laughed.



<P>`I have heard that talk since my Sixth Day,' he replied, squatting by

the light. `Whither does it lead?'



<P>`To protection. Tonight we change thy colour. This sleeping under roofs

has blanched thee like an almond. But Huneefa has the secret of a colour

that catches. No painting of a day or two. Also, we fortify thee against

the chances of the Road. That is <I>my</I> gift to thee, my son. Take out

all metals on thee and lay them here. Make ready, Huneefa.'



<P>Kim dragged forth his compass, Survey paint-box, and the new-filled

medicine-box. They had all accompanied his travels, and boylike he valued

them immensely.



<P>The woman rose slowly and moved with her hands a little spread before

her. Then Kim saw that she was blind. `No, no,' she muttered, `the Pathan

speaks truth - my colour does not go in a week or a month, and those whom

I protect are under strong guard.'



<P>`When one is far off and alone, it would not be well to grow blotched

and leprous of a sudden,' said Mahbub. `When thou wast with me I could

oversee the matter. Besides, a Pathan is a fair-skin. Strip to the waist

now and look how thou art whitened.' Huneefa felt her way back from an

inner room. `It is no matter, she cannot see.' He took a pewter bowl from

her ringed hand.



<P>The dye-stuff showed blue and gummy. Kim experimented on the back of

his wrist, with a dab of cotton-wool; but Huneefa heard him.



<P>`No, no,' she cried, `the thing is not done thus, but with the proper

ceremonies. The colouring is the least part. I give thee the full protection

of the Road.'



<P>`<I>Jadoo</I>? [magic],' said Kim, with a half start. He did not like

the white, sightless eyes. Mahbub's hand on his neck bowed him to the floor,

nose within an inch of the boards.



<P>`Be still. No harm comes to thee, my son. I am thy sacrifice!'



<P>He could not see what the woman was about, but heard the clish-clash

of her jewellery for many minutes. A match lit up the darkness; he caught

the well-known purr and fizzle of grains of incense. Then the room filled

with smoke - heavy aromatic, and stupefying. Through growing drowse he

heard the names of devils - of Zulbazan, Son of Eblis, who lives in bazars

and <I>paraos</I>, making all the sudden lewd wickedness of wayside halts;

of Dulhan, invisible about mosques, the dweller among the slippers of the

faithful, who hinders folk from their prayers; and Musboot, Lord of lies

and panic. Huneefa, now whispering in his ear, now talking as from an immense

distance, touched him with horrible soft fingers, but Mahbub's grip never

shifted from his neck till, relaxing with a sigh, the boy lost his senses.



<P>`Allah! How he fought! We should never have done it but for the drugs.

That was his white blood, I take it,' said Mahbub testily. `Go on with

the <I>dawut</I> [invocation]. Give him full Protection.'



<P>`<I>O Hearer! Thou that hearest with ears, be present. Listen, O Hearer</I>!'

Huneefa moaned, her dead eyes turned to the west. The dark room filled

with moanings and snortings.



<P>From the outer balcony, a ponderous figure raised a round bullet head

and coughed nervously.



<P>`Do not interrupt this ventriloquial necromanciss, my friend,' it said

in English. `I opine that it is very disturbing to you, but no enlightened

observer is jolly-well upset.'



<P>`... <I>I will lay a plot for their ruin! O Prophet, bear with the unbelievers.

Let them alone awhile</I>!' Huneefa's face, turned to the northward, worked

horribly, and it was as though voices from the ceiling answered her.



<P>Hurree Babu returned to his note-book, balanced on the window-sill,

but his hand shook. Huneefa, in some sort of drugged-ecstasy, wrenched

herself to and fro as she sat cross-legged by Kim's still head, and called

upon devil after devil, in the ancient order of the ritual, binding them

to avoid the boy's every action.



<P>`<I>With Him are the keys of the Secret Things! None knoweth them besides

Himself He knoweth that which is in the dry land and in the sea</I>'' Again

broke out the unearthly whistling responses.



<P>`I - I apprehend it is not at all malignant in its operation?' said

the Babu, watching the throat-muscles quiver and jerk as Huneefa spoke

with tongues. `It - it is not likely that she has killed the boy? If so,

I decline to be witness at the trial... What was the last hypothetical

devil mentioned?'



<P>`Babuji,' said Mahbub in the vernacular. `I have no regard for the devils

of Hind, but the Sons of Eblis are far otherwise, and whether they be <I>jumalee</I>

[well-affected] or <I>jullalee</I> [terrible] they love not Kafirs.'



<P>`Then you think I had better go?' said Hurree Babu, half rising. `They

are, of course, dematerialized phenomena. Spencer says - '



<P>Huneefa's crisis passed, as these things must, in a paroxysm of howling,

with a touch of froth at the lips. She lay spent and motionless beside

Kim, and the crazy voices ceased.



<P>`Wah! That work is done. May the boy be better for it; and Huneefa is

surely a mistress of <I>dawut</I>. Help haul her aside, Babu. Do not be

afraid.'



<P>`How am I to fear the absolutely non-existent?' said Hurree Babu, talking

English to reassure himself. It is an awful thing still to dread the magic

that you contemptuously investigate - to collect folk-lore for the Royal

Society with a lively belief in all Powers of Darkness.



<P>Mahbub chuckled. He had been out with Hurree on the Road ere now. `Let

us finish the colouring,' said he. `The boy is well protected if - if the

Lords of the Air have ears to hear. I am a <I>Sufi</I> [free-thinker],

but when one can get blind-sides of a woman, a stallion, or a devil, why

go round to invite a kick? Set him upon the way, Babu, and see that old

Red Hat does not lead him beyond our reach. I must get back to my horses.'



<P>`All raight,' said Hurree Babu. `He is at present curious spectacle.'&nbsp;

<HR>About third cockcrow, Kim woke after a sleep of thousands of years.

Huneefa, in her corner, snored heavily, but Mahbub was gone.



<P>`I hope you were not frightened,' said an oily voice at his elbow. `I

superintended entire operation, which was most interesting from ethnological

point of view. It was high-class <I>dawut</I>.'



<P>`Huh!' said Kim, recognizing Hurree Babu, who smiled ingratiatingly.



<P>`And also I had honour to bring down from Lurgan your present costume.

lam not in the habit offeecially of carrying such gauds to subordinates,

but' - he giggled - `your case is noted as exceptional on the books. I

hope Mr Lurgan will note my action.'



<P>Kim yawned and stretched himself. It was good to turn and twist within

loose clothes once again.



<P>`What is this?' He looked curiously at the heavy duffle-stuff loaded

with the scents of the far North.



<P>`Oho! That is inconspicuous dress of <I>chela</I> attached to service

of lamaistic lama. Complete in every particular,' said Hurree Babu, rolling

into the balcony to clean his teeth at a goglet. `I am of opeenion it is

not your old gentleman's precise releegion, but rather sub-variant of same.

I have contributed rejected notes to <I>Asiatic Quarterly Review</I> on

these subjects. Now it is curious that the old gentleman himself is totally

devoid of releegiosity. He is not a dam' particular.'



<P>`Do you know him?'



<P>Hurree Babu held up his hand to show he was engaged in the prescribed

rites that accompany tooth-cleaning and such things among decently bred

Bengalis. Then he recited in English an Arya-Somaj prayer of a theistical

nature, and stuffed his mouth with <I>pan</I> and betel.



<P>`Oah yes. I have met him several times at Benares, and also at Buddh

Gaya, to interrogate him on releegious points and devil-worship. He is

pure agnostic - same as me.'



<P>Huneefa stirred in her sleep, and Hurree Babu jumped nervously to the

copper incense-burner, all black and discoloured in morning-light, rubbed

a finger in the accumulated lampblack, and drew it diagonally across his

face.



<P>`Who has died in thy house?' asked Kim in the vernacular.



<P>`None. But she may have the Evil Eye - that sorceress,' the Babu replied.



<P>`What dost thou do now, then?'



<P>`I will set thee on thy way to Benares, if thou goest thither, and tell

thee what must be known by Us.'



<P>`I go. At what hour runs the <I>te-rain</I>?' He rose to his feet, looked

round the desolate chamber and at the yellow-wax face of Huneefa as the

low sun stole across the floor. `Is there money to be paid that witch?'



<P>`No. She has charmed thee against all devils and all dangers - in the

name of her devils. It was Mahbub's desire.' In English: `He is highly

obsolete, I think, to indulge in such supersteetion. Why, it is all ventriloquy.

Belly-speak - eh?'



<P>Kim snapped his fingers mechanically to avert whatever evil - Mahbub,

he knew, meditated none - might have crept in through Huneefa's ministrations;

and Hurree giggled once more. But as he crossed the room he was careful

not to step in Huneefa's blotched, squat shadow on the boards. Witches

- when their time is on them - can lay hold of the heels of a man's soul

if he does that.



<P>`Now you must well listen,' said the Babu when they were in the fresh

air. `Part of these ceremonies which we witnessed they include supply of

effeecient amulet to those of our Department. If you feel in your neck

you will find one small silver amulet, verree cheap. That is <I>ours</I>.

Do you understand?'



<P>`Oah yes, <I>hawa-dilli</I> [a heart-lifter],' said Kim, feeling at

his neck.



<P>`Huneefa she makes them for two rupees twelve annas with - oh, all sorts

of exorcisms. They are quite common, except they are partially black enamel,

and there is a paper inside each one full of names of local saints and

such things. <I>Thatt</I> is Huneefa's look-out, you see? Huneefa makes

them onlee for us, but in case she does not, when we get them we put in,

before issue, one small piece of turquoise. Mr Lurgan he gives them. There

is no other source of supply; but it was me invented all this. It is strictly

unoffeecial of course, but convenient for subordinates. Colonel Creighton

he does not know. He is European. The turquoise is wrapped in the paper...

Yes, that is road to railway station... Now suppose you go with the lama,

or with me, I hope, some day, or with Mahbub. Suppose we get into a dam'-tight

place. I am a fearful man - most fearful - but I tell you I have been in

dam'-tight places more than hairs on my head. You say: `I am Son of the

Charm.' Verree good.'



<P>`I do not understand quite. We must not be heard talking English here.'



<P>`That is all raight. I am only Babu showing off my English to you. All

we Babus talk English to show off;' said Hurree, flinging his shoulder-cloth

jauntily. `As I was about to say, `Son of the Charm' means that you may

be member of the <I>Sat Bhai</I> - the Seven Brothers, which is Hindi <I>and</I>

Tantric. It is popularly supposed to be extinct Society, but I have written

notes to show it is still extant. You see, it is all my invention. Verree

good. <I>Sat Bhai</I> has many members, and perhaps before they jolly-well-cut-your-throat

they may give you just a chance of life. That is useful, anyhow. And moreover,

these foolish natives - if they are not too excited - they always stop

to think before they kill a man who says he belongs to any speecific organization.

You see? You say then when you are in tight place, `I am Son of the Charm',

and you get - perhaps - ah - your second wind. That is only in extreme

instances, or to open negotiations with a stranger. Can you quite see?

Verree good. But suppose now, I, or any one of the Department, come to

you dressed quite different. You would not know me at all unless I choose,

I bet you. Some day I will prove it. I come as Ladakhi trader - oh, anything

- and I say to you: `You want to buy precious stones?' You say: `Do I look

like a man who buys precious stones?' Then I say: `Even verree poor man

can buy a turquoise or <I>tarkeean</I>.''



<P>`That is <I>kichree</I> - vegetable curry,' said Kim.



<P>`Of course it is. You say: `Let me see the <I>tarkeean</I>.' Then I

say: `It was cooked by a woman, and perhaps it is bad for your caste.'

Then you say: `There is no caste when men go to - look for <I>tarkeean</I>.'

You stop a little between those words, `to - look'. That is thee whole

secret. The little stop before the words.'



<P>Kim repeated the test-sentence.



<P>`That is all right. Then I will show you my turquoise if there is time,

and then you know who I am, and then we exchange views and documents and

those-all things. And so it is with any other man of us. We talk sometimes

about turquoises and sometimes about <I>tarkeean</I>, but always with that

little stop in the words. It is verree easy. First, `Son of the Charm',

if you are in a tight place. Perhaps that may help you - perhaps not. Then

what I have told you about the <I>tarkeean</I>, if you want to transact

offeecial business with a strange man. Of course, at present, you have

no offeecial business. You are - ah ha! - supernumerary on probation. Quite

unique specimen. If you were Asiatic of birth you might be employed right

off; but this half-year of leave is to make you de-Englishized, you see?

The lama he expects you, because I have demi-offeecially informed him you

have passed all your examinations, and will soon obtain Government appointment.

Oh ho! You are on acting-allowance, you see: so if you are called upon

to help Sons of the Charm mind you jolly-well try. Now I shall say good-bye,

my dear fellow, and I hope you - ah - will come out top-side all raight.'



<P>Hurree Babu stepped back a pace or two into the crowd at the entrance

of Lucknow station and - was gone. Kim drew a deep breath and hugged himself

all over. The nickel-plated revolver he could feel in the bosom of his

sad-coloured robe, the amulet was on his neck; begging-gourd, rosary, and

ghost-dagger (Mr Lurgan had forgotten nothing) were all to hand, with medicine,

paint-box, and compass, and in a worn old purse-belt embroidered with porcupine-quill

patterns lay a month's pay. Kings could be no richer. He bought sweetmeats

in a leaf-cup from a Hindu trader, and ate them with glad rapture till

a policeman ordered him off the steps.

<P><I>Sir John Christie.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

In the afternoon the red-faced schoolmaster told Kim that he had been <I>struck

off the strength</I>, which conveyed no meaning to him till he was ordered

to go away and play. Then he ran to the bazar, and found the young letter-writer

to whom he owed a stamp.



<P>`Now I pay,' said Kim royally, `and now I need another letter to be

written.'



<P>`Mahbub Ali is in Umballa,' said the writer jauntily. He was, by virtue

of his office, a bureau of general misinformation.



<P>`This is not to Mahbub, but to a priest. Take thy pen and write quickly.

`To Teshoo Lama, the Holy One from Bhotya seeking for a River, who is now

in the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares'. Take more ink! `In three

days I am to go down to Nucklao to the school at Nucklao. The name of the

school is Xavier. I do not know where that school is, but it is at Nucklao'.'



<P>`But I know Nucklao,' the writer interrupted. `I know the school.'



<P>`Tell him where it is, and I give half an anna.'



<P>The reed pen scratched busily. `He cannot mistake.' The man lifted his

head. `Who watches us across the street?'



<P>Kim looked up hurriedly and saw Colonel Creighton in tennis-flannels.



<P>`Oh, that is some Sahib who knows the fat priest in the barracks. He

is beckoning me.'



<P>`What dost thou?' said the Colonel, when Kim trotted up.



<P>`I - I am not running away. I send a letter to my Holy One at Benares.'



<P>`I had not thought of that. Hast thou said that I take thee to Lucknow?'



<P>`Nay, I have not. Read the letter, if there be a doubt.'



<P>`Then why hast thou left out my name in writing to that Holy One?' The

Colonel smiled a queer smile. Kim took his courage in both hands.



<P>`It was said once to me that it is inexpedient to write the names of

strangers concerned in any matter, because by the naming of names many

good plans are brought to confusion.'



<P>`Thou hast been well taught,' the Colonel replied, and Kim flushed.

`I have left my cheroot-case in the Padre's veranda. Bring it to my house

this even.'



<P>`Where is the house?' said Kim. His quick wit told him that he was being

tested in some fashion or another, and he stood on guard.



<P>`Ask anyone in the big bazar.' The Colonel walked on.



<P>`He has forgotten his cheroot-case,' said Kim, returning. `I must bring

it to him this evening. That is all my letter except, thrice over, `Come

to me! Come to me! Come to me'! Now I will pay for a stamp and put it in

the post.' He rose to go, and as an afterthought asked: `Who is that angry-faced

Sahib who lost the cheroot-case?'



<P>`Oh, he is only Creighton Sahib - a very foolish Sahib, who is a Colonel

Sahib without a regiment.'



<P>`What is his business?'



<P>`God knows. He is always buying horses which he cannot ride, and asking

riddles about the works of God - such as plants and stones and the customs

of people. The dealers call him the father of fools, because he is so easily

cheated about a horse. Mahbub Ali says he is madder than most other Sahibs.'



<P>`Oh!' said Kim, and departed. His training had given him some small

knowledge of character, and he argued that fools are not given information

which leads to calling out eight thousand men besides guns. The Commander-in-Chief

of all India does not talk, as Kim had heard him talk, to fools. Nor would

Mahbub Ali's tone have changed, as it did every time he mentioned the Colonel's

name, if the Colonel had been a fool. Consequently - and this set Kim to

skipping - there was a mystery somewhere, and Mahbub Ali probably spied

for the Colonel much as Kim had spied for Mahbub. And, like the horse-dealer,

the Colonel evidently respected people who did not show themselves to be

too clever.



<P>He rejoiced that he had not betrayed his knowledge of the Colonel's

house; and when, on his return to barracks, he discovered that no cheroot-case

had been left behind, he beamed with delight. Here was a man after his

own heart - a tortuous and indirect person playing a hidden game. Well,

if he could be a fool, so could Kim.



<P>He showed nothing of his mind when Father Victor, for three long mornings,

discoursed to him of an entirely new set of Gods and Godlings - notably

of a Goddess called Mary, who, he gathered, was one with Bibi Miriam of

Mahbub Ali's theology. He betrayed no emotion when, after the lecture,

Father Victor dragged him from shop to shop buying articles of outfit,

nor when envious drummer-boys kicked him because he was going to a superior

school did he complain, but awaited the play of circumstances with an interested

soul. Father Victor, good man, took him to the station, put him into an

empty second-class next to Colonel Creighton's first, and bade him farewell

with genuine feeling.



<P>`They'll make a man o' you, O'Hara, at St Xavier's - a white man, an',

I hope, a good man. They know all about your comin', an' the Colonel will

see that ye're not lost or mislaid anywhere on the road. I've given you

a notion of religious matters, - at least I hope so, - and you'll remember,

when they ask you your religion, that you're a Cath'lic. Better say Roman

Cath'lic, tho' I'm not fond of the word.'



<P>Kim lit a rank cigarette - he had been careful to buy a stock in the

bazar - and lay down to think. This solitary passage was very different

from that joyful down-journey in the third-class with the lama. `Sahibs

get little pleasure of travel,' he reflected. `<I>Hai mai</I>! I go from

one place to another as it might be a kick-ball. It is my <I>Kismet</I>.

No man can escape his <I>Kismet</I>. But I am to pray to Bibi Miriam, and

I am a Sahib.' He looked at his boots ruefully. `No; I am Kim. This is

the great world, and I am only Kim. Who is Kim?' He considered his own

identity, a thing he had never done before, till his head swam. He was

one insignificant person in all this roaring whirl of India, going southward

to he knew not what fate.



<P>Presently the Colonel sent for him, and talked for a long time. So far

as Kim could gather, he was to be diligent and enter the Survey of India

as a chain-man. If he were very good, and passed the proper examinations,

he would be earning thirty rupees a month at seventeen years old, and Colonel

Creighton would see that he found suitable employment.



<P>Kim pretended at first to understand perhaps one word in three of this

talk. Then the Colonel, seeing his mistake, turned to fluent and picturesque

Urdu and Kim was contented. No man could be a fool who knew the language

so intimately, who moved so gently and silently, and whose eyes were so

different from the dull fat eyes of other Sahibs.



<P>`Yes, and thou must learn how to make pictures of roads and mountains

and rivers - to carry these pictures in thine eye till a suitable time

comes to set them upon paper. Perhaps some day, when thou art a chain-man,

I may say to thee when we are working together: `Go across those hills

and see what lies beyond.' Then one will say: `There are bad people living

in those hills who will slay the chain-man if he be seen to look like a

Sahib.' What then?'



<P>Kim thought. Would it be safe to return the Colonel's lead?



<P>`I would tell what that other man had said.'



<P>`But if I answered: `I will give thee a hundred rupees for knowledge

of what is behind those hills - for a picture of a river and a little news

of what the people say in the villages there'?'



<P>`How can I tell? I am only a boy. Wait till I am a man.' Then, seeing

the Colonel's brow clouded, he went on: `But I think I should in a few

days earn the hundred rupees.'



<P>`By what road?'



<P>Kim shook his head resolutely. `If I said how I would earn them, another

man might hear and forestall me. It is not good to sell knowledge for nothing.'



<P>`Tell now.' The Colonel held up a rupee. Kim's hand half reached towards

it, and dropped.



<P>`Nay, Sahib; nay. I know the price that will be paid for the answer,

but I do not know why the question is asked.'



<P>`Take it for a gift, then,' said Creighton, tossing it over. `There

is a good spirit in thee. Do not let it be blunted at St Xavier's. There

are many boys there who despise the black men.'



<P>`Their mothers were bazar-women,' said Kim. He knew well there is no

hatred like that of the half-caste for his brother-in-law.



<P>`True; but thou art a Sahib and the son of a Sahib. Therefore, do not

at any time be led to contemn the black men. I have known boys newly entered

into the service of the Government who feigned not to understand the talk

or the customs of black men. Their pay was cut for ignorance. There is

no sin so great as ignorance. Remember this.'



<P>Several times in the course of the long twenty-four hours' run south

did the Colonel send for Kim, always developing this latter text.



<P>`We be all on one lead-rope, then,' said Kim at last, `the Colonel,

Mahbub Ali, and I - when I become a chain-man. He will use me as Mahbub

Ali employed me, I think. That is good, if it allows me to return to the

Road again. This clothing grows no easier by wear.'



<P>When they came to the crowded Lucknow station there was no sign of the

lama. He swallowed his disappointment, while the Colonel bundled him into

a <I>ticca-gharri</I> with his neat belongings and despatched him alone

to St Xavier's.



<P>`I do not say farewell, because we shall meet again,' he cried. `Again,

and many times, if thou art one of good spirit. But thou art not yet tried.'



<P>`Not when I brought thee' - Kim actually dared to use the <I>tum</I>

of equals - `a white stallion's pedigree that night?'



<P>`Much is gained by forgetting, little brother,' said the Colonel, with

a look that pierced through Kim's shoulder-blades as he scuttled into the

carriage.



<P>It took him nearly five minutes to recover. Then he sniffed the new

air appreciatively. `A rich city,' he said. `Richer than Lahore. How good

the bazars must be! Coachman, drive me a little through the bazars here.'



<P>`My order is to take thee to the school.' The driver used the `thou',

which is rudeness when applied to a white man. In the clearest and most

fluent vernacular Kim pointed out his error, climbed on to the box-seat,

and, perfect understanding established, drove for a couple of hours up

and down, estimating, comparing, and enjoying. There is no city - except

Bombay, the queen of all - more beautiful in her garish style than Lucknow,

whether you see her from the bridge over the river, or from the top of

the Imambara looking down on the gilt umbrellas of the Chutter Munzil,

and the trees in which the town is bedded. Kings have adorned her with

fantastic buildings, endowed her with charities, crammed her with pensioners,

and drenched her with blood. She is the centre of all idleness, intrigue,

and luxury, and shares with Delhi the claim to talk the only pure Urdu.



<P>`A fair city - a beautiful city.' The driver, as a Lucknow man, was

pleased with the compliment, and told Kim many astounding things where

an English guide would have talked of the Mutiny.



<P>`Now we will go to the school,' said Kim at last. The great old school

of St Xavier's in Partibus, block on block of low white buildings, stands

in vast grounds over against the Gumti River, at some distance from the

city.



<P>`What like of folk are they within?' said Kim.



<P>`Young Sahibs - all devils. But to speak truth, and I drive many of

them to and fro from the railway station, I have never seen one that had

in him the making of a more perfect devil than thou - this young Sahib

whom I am now driving.'



<P>Naturally, for he was never trained to consider them in any way improper,

Kim had passed the time of day with one or two frivolous ladies at upper

windows in a certain street, and naturally, in the exchange of compliments,

had acquitted himself well. He was about to acknowledge the driver's last

insolence, when his eye - it was growing dusk - caught a figure sitting

by one of the white plaster gate-pillars in the long sweep of wall.



<P>`Stop!' he cried. `Stay here. I do not go to the school at once.'



<P>`But what is to pay me for this coming and re-coming?' said the driver

petulantly. `Is the boy mad? Last time it was a dancing-girl. This time

it is a priest.'



<P>Kim was in the road headlong, patting the dusty feet beneath the dirty

yellow robe.



<P>`I have waited here a day and a half,' the lama's level voice began.

`Nay, I had a disciple with me. He that was my friend at the Temple of

the Tirthankars gave me a guide for this journey. I came from Benares in

the <I>te-rain</I>, when thy letter was given me. Yes, I am well fed. I

need nothing.'



<P>`But why didst thou not stay with the Kulu woman, O Holy One? In what

way didst thou get to Benares? My heart has been heavy since we parted.'



<P>`The woman wearied me by constant flux of talk and requiring charms

for children. I separated myself from that company, permitting her to acquire

merit by gifts. She is at least a woman of open hands, and I made a promise

to return to her house if need arose. Then, perceiving myself alone in

this great and terrible world, I bethought me of the <I>te-rain</I> to

Benares, where I knew one abode in the Tirthankars' Temple who was a Seeker,

even as I.'



<P>`Ah! Thy River,' said Kim. `I had forgotten the River.'



<P>`So soon, my <I>chela</I>? I have never forgotten it. But when I had

left thee it seemed better that I should go to the Temple and take counsel,

for, look you, India is very large, and it may be that wise men before

us, some two or three, have left a record of the place of our River. There

is debate in the Temple of the Tirthankars on this matter; some saying

one thing, and some another. They are courteous folk.'



<P>`So be it; but what dost thou do now?'



<P>`I acquire merit in that I help thee, my <I>chela</I>, to wisdom. The

priest of that body of men who serve the Red Bull wrote me that all should

be as I desired for thee. I sent the money to suffice for one year, and

then I came, as thou seest me, to watch for thee going up into the Gates

of Learning. A day and a half have I waited - not because I was led by

any affection towards thee - that is no part of the Way - but, as they

said at the Tirthankars' Temple, because, money having been paid for learning,

it was right that I should oversee the end of the matter. They resolved

my doubts most clearly. I had a fear that, perhaps, I came because I wished

to see thee - misguided by the Red Mist of affection. It is not so... Moreover,

I am troubled by a dream.'



<P>`But surely, Holy One, thou hast not forgotten the Road and all that

befell on it. Surely it was a little to see me that thou didst come?'



<P>`The horses are cold, and it is past their feeding-time,' whined the

driver.



<P>`Go to Jehannum and abide there with thy reputationless aunt!' Kim snarled

over his shoulder. `I am all alone in this land; I know not where I go

nor what shall befall me. My heart was in that letter I sent thee. Except

for Mahbub Ali, and he is a Pathan, I have no friend save thee, Holy One.

Do not altogether go away.'



<P>`I have considered that also,' the lama replied, in a shaking voIce.

`It is manifest that from time to time I shall acquire merit - if before

that I have not found my River - by assuring myself that thy feet are set

on wisdom. What they will teach thee I do not know, but the priest wrote

me that no son of a Sahib in all India will be better taught than thou.

So from time to time, therefore, I will come again. Maybe thou wilt be

such a Sahib as he who gave me these spectacles' - the lama wiped them

elaborately - `in the Wonder House at Lahore. That is my hope, for he was

a Fountain of Wisdom - wiser than many abbots... Again, maybe thou wilt

forget me and our meetings.'



<P>`If I eat thy bread,' cried Kim passionately, `how shall I ever forget

thee?'



<P>`No - no.' He put the boy aside. `I must go back to Benares. From time

to time, now that I know the customs of letter-writers in this land, I

will send thee a letter, and from time to time I will come and see thee.'



<P>`But whither shall I send my letters?' wailed Kim, clutching at the

robe, all forgetful that he was a Sahib.



<P>`To the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares. That is the place I have

chosen till I find my River. Do not weep; for, look you, all Desire is

Illusion and a new binding upon the Wheel. Go up to the Gates of Learning.

Let me see thee go... Dost thou love me? Then go, or my heart cracks...

I will come again. Surely I will come again.'



<P>The lama watched the <I>ticca-gharri</I> rumble into the compound, and

strode off, snuffing between each long stride.



<P><I>The Gates of Learning</I> shut with a clang.&nbsp;

<HR>The country born and bred boy has his own manners and customs, which

do not resemble those of any other land; and his teachers approach him

by roads which an English master would not understand. Therefore, you would

scarcely be interested in Kim's experiences as a St Xavier's boy among

two or three hundred precocious youths, most of whom had never seen the

sea. He suffered the usual penalties for breaking out of bounds when there

was cholera in the city. This was before he had learned to write fair English,

and so was obliged to find a bazar letter-writer. He was, of course, indicted

for smoking and for the use of abuse more full-flavoured than even St Xavier's

had ever heard. He learned to wash himself with the Levitical scrupulosity

of the native-born, who in his heart considers the Englishman rather dirty.

He played the usual tricks on the patient coolies pulling the punkahs in

the sleeping-rooms where the boys threshed through the hot nights telling

tales till the dawn; and quietly he measured himself against his self-reliant

mates.



<P>They were sons of subordinate officials in the Railway, Telegraph, and

Canal Services; of warrant-officers, sometimes retired and sometimes acting

as commanders-in-chief to a feudatory Rajah's army; of captains of the

Indian Marine Government pensioners, planters, Presidency shopkeepers,

and missionaries. A few were cadets of the old Eurasian houses that have

taken strong root in Dhurrumtollah - Pereiras, De Souzas, and D'Silvas.

Their parents could well have educated them in England, but they loved

the school that had served their own youth, and generation followed sallow-hued

generation at St Xavier's. Their homes ranged from Howrah of the railway

people to abandoned cantonments like Monghyr and Chunar; lost tea-gardens

Shillong-way; villages where their fathers were large landholders in Oudh

or the Deccan; Mission-stations a week from the nearest railway line; seaports

a thousand miles south, facing the brazen Indian surf, and cinchona-plantations

south of all. The mere story of their adventures, which to them were no

adventures, on their road to and from school would have crisped a Western

boy's hair. They were used to jogging off alone through a hundred miles

of jungle, where there was always the delightful chance of being delayed

by tigers; but they would no more have bathed in the English Channel in

an English August than their brothers across the world would have lain

still while a leopard snuffed at their palanquin. There were boys of fifteen

who had spent a day and a half on an islet in the middle of a flooded river,

taking charge, as by right, of a camp of frantic pilgrims returning from

a shrine. There were seniors who had requisitioned a chance-met Rajah's

elephant, in the name of St Francis Xavier, when the Rains once blotted

out the cart-track that led to their father's estate, and had all but lost

the huge beast in a quicksand. There was a boy who, he said, and none doubted,

had helped his father to beat off with rifles from the veranda a rush of

Akas in the days when those head-hunters were bold against lonely plantations.



<P>And every tale was told in the even, passionless voice of the native-born,

mixed with quaint reflections, borrowed unconsciously from native foster-mothers,

and turns of speech that showed they had been that instant translated from

the vernacular. Kim watched, listened, and approved. This was not insipid,

single-word talk of drummer-boys. It dealt with a life he knew and in part

understood. The atmosphere suited him, and he throve by inches. They gave

him a white drill suit as the weather warmed, and he rejoiced in the new-found

bodily comforts as he rejoiced to use his sharpened mind over the tasks

they set him. His quickness would have delighted an English master; but

at St Xavier's they know the first rush of minds developed by sun and surroundings,

as they know the half-collapse that sets in at twenty-two or twenty-three.



<P>None the less he remembered to hold himself lowly. When tales were told

of hot nights, Kim did not sweep the board with his reminiscences; for

St Xavier's looks down on boys who <I>go native all-together</I>. One must

never forget that one is a Sahib, and that some day, when examinations

are passed, one will command natives. Kim made a note of this, for he began

to understand where examinations led.



<P>Then came the holidays from August to October - the long holidays imposed

by the heat and the Rains. Kim was informed that he would go north to some

station in the hills behind Umballa, where Father Victor would arrange

for him.



<P>`A barrack-school?' said Kim, who had asked many questions and thought

more.



<P>`Yes, I suppose so,' said the master. `It will not do you any harm to

keep you out of mischief. You can go up with young De Castro as far as

Delhi.'



<P>Kim considered it in every possible light. He had been diligent, even

as the Colonel advised. A boy's holiday was his own property - of so much

the talk of his companions had advised him, - and a barrack-school would

be torment after St Xavier's. Moreover - this was magic worth anything

else - he could write. In three months he had discovered how men can speak

to each other without a third party, at the cost of half an anna and a

little knowledge. No word had come from the lama, but there remained the

Road. Kim yearned for the caress of soft mud squishing up between the toes,

as his mouth watered for mutton stewed with butter and cabbages, for rice

speckled with strong-scented cardamoms, for the saffron-tinted rice, garlic

and onions, and the forbidden greasy sweetmeats of the bazars. They would

feed him raw beef on a platter at the barrack-school, and he must smoke

by stealth. But again, he was a Sahib and was at St Xavier's, and that

pig Mahbub.... . No, he would not test Mahbub's hospitality - and yet...

He thought it out alone in the dormitory, and came to the conclusion he

had been unjust to Mahbub.



<P>The school was empty; nearly all the masters had gone away; Colonel

Creighton's railway pass lay in his hand, and Kim puffed himself that he

had not spent Colonel Creighton's or Mahbub's money in riotous living.

He was still lord of two rupees seven annas. His new bullock-trunk, marked

<I>K. O'H.</I>, and bedding-roll lay in the empty sleeping-room. `Sahibs

are always tied to their baggage,' said Kim, nodding at them. `You will

stay here.' He went out into the warm rain, smiling sinfully, and sought

a certain house whose outside he had noted down some time before...



<P>`<I>Arr&eacute;</I>! Dost thou know what manner of women we be in this

quarter? Oh, shame!'



<P>`Was I born yesterday?' Kim squatted native-fashion on the cushions

of that upper room. `A little dyestuff and three yards of cloth to help

out a jest. Is it much to ask?'



<P>`Who is <I>she</I>? Thou art full young, as Sahibs go, for this devilry.'



<P>`Oh, she? She is the daughter of a certain schoolmaster of a regiment

in the cantonments. He has beaten me twice because I went over their wall

in these clothes. Now I would go as a gardener's boy. Old men are very

jealous.'



<P>`That is true. Hold thy face still while I dab on the juice.'



<P>`Not too black, <I>Naikan</I>. I would not appear to her as a <I>hubshi</I>

[nigger].'



<P>`Oh, love makes nought of these things. And how old is she?'



<P>`Twelve years, I think,' said the shameless Kim. `Spread it also on

the breast. It may be her father will tear my clothes off me, and if I

am piebald - ' he laughed.



<P>The girl worked busily, dabbing a twist of cloth into a little saucer

of brown dye that holds longer than any walnut-juice.



<P>`Now-send out and get me a cloth for the turban. Woe is me, my head

is all unshaved! And he will surely knock off my turban.'



<P>`I am not a barber, but I will make shift. Thou wast born to be a breaker

of hearts! All this disguise for one evening? Remember, the stuff does

not wash away.' She shook with laughter till her bracelets and anklets

jingled. `But who is to pay me for this? Huneefa herself could not have

given thee better stuff.'



<P>`Trust in the Gods, my sister,' said Kim gravely, screwing his face

round as the stain dried. `Besides, hast thou ever helped to paint a Sahib

thus before?'



<P>`Never indeed. But a jest is not money.'



<P>`It is worth much more.'



<P>`Child, thou art beyond all dispute the most shameless son of Shaitan

that I have ever known to take up a poor girl's time with this play, and

then to say: `Is not the jest enough?' Thou wilt go very far in this world.'

She gave the dancing-girls' salutation in mockery.



<P>`All one. Make haste and rough-cut my head.' Kim shifted from foot to

foot, his eyes ablaze with mirth as he thought of the fat days before him.

He gave the girl four annas, and ran down the stairs in the likeness of

a low-caste Hindu boy - perfect in every detail. A cookshop was his next

point of call, where he feasted in extravagance and greasy luxury.



<P>On Lucknow station platform he watched young De Castro, all covered

with prickly-heat, get into a second-class compartment. Kim patronized

a third, and was the life and soul of it. He explained to the company that

he was assistant to a juggler who had left him behind sick with fever,

and that he would pick up his master at Umballa. As the occupants of the

carriage changed, he varied this tale, or adorned it with all the shoots

of a budding fancy, the more rampant for being held off native speech so

long. In all India that night was no human being so joyful as Kim. At Umballa

he got out and headed eastward, plashing over the sodden fields to the

village where the old soldier lived.



<P>About this time Colonel Creighton at Simla was advised from Lucknow

by wire that young O'Hara had disappeared. Mahbub Ali was in town selling

horses, and to him the Colonel confided the affair one morning cantering

round Annandale racecourse.



<P>`Oh, that is nothing,' said the horse-dealer. `Men are like horses.

At certain times they need salt, and if that salt is not in the mangers

they will lick it up from the earth. He has gone back to the Road again

for a while. The <I>madrissah</I> wearied him. I knew it would. Another

time, I will take him upon the Road myself. Do not be troubled, Creighton

Sahib. It is as though a polo-pony, breaking loose, ran out to learn the

game alone.'



<P>`Then he is not dead, think you?'



<P>`Fever might kill him. I do not fear for the boy otherwise. A monkey

does not fall among trees.'



<P>Next morning, on the same course, Mahbub's stallion ranged alongside

the Colonel.



<P>`It is as I had thought,' said the horse-dealer. `He has come through

Umballa at least, and there he has written a letter to me, having learned

in the bazar that I was here.'



<P>`Read,' said the Colonel, with a sigh of relief. It was absurd that

a man of his position should take an interest in a little country-bred

vagabond; but the Colonel remembered the conversation in the train, and

often in the past few months had caught himself thinking of the queer,

silent, self-possessed boy. His evasion, of course, was the height of insolence,

but it argued some resource and nerve.



<P>Mahbub's eyes twinkled as he reined out into the centre of the cramped

little plain, where none could come near unseen.



<P>`"

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Friend of the Stars, who is the Friend of all the World

'

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The Friend of all the World takes leave to go to his own places.

He will come back upon the appointed day. Let the box and the bedding-roll

<P>`"

<BLOCKQUOTE>Certain things are not known to those who eat with forks. It

is better to eat with both hands for a while. Speak soft words to those

who do not understand this that the return may be propitious."</BLOCKQUOTE>

Now the manner in which that was cast is, of course, the work of the letter-writer,

but see how wisely the boy has devised the matter of it so that no hint

is given except to those who know!'



<P>`Is this the Hand of Friendship to avert the Whip of Calamity?' laughed

the Colonel.



<P>`See how wise is the boy. He would go back to the Road again, as I said.

Not knowing yet thy trade - '



<P>`I am not at all sure of that,' the Colonel muttered.



<P>`He turns to me to make a peace between you. Is he not wise? He says

he will return. He is but perfecting his knowledge. Think, Sahib! He has

been three months at the school. And he is not mouthed to that bit. For

my part, I rejoice. The pony learns the game.'



<P>`Ay, but another time he must not go alone.'



<P>`Why? He went alone before he came under the Colonel Sahib's protection.

When he comes to the Great Game he must go alone - alone, and at peril

of his head. <I>Then</I>, if he spits, or sneezes, or sits down other than

as the people do whom he watches, he may be slain. Why hinder him now?

Remember how the Persians say: The jackal that lives in the wilds of Mazanderan

can only be caught by the hounds of Mazanderan.'



<P>`True. It is true, Mahbub Ali. And if he comes to no harm, I do not

desire anything better. But it is great insolence on his part.'



<P>`He does not tell me, even, whither he goes,' said Mahbub. `He is no

fool. When his time is accomplished he will come to me. It is time the

healer of pearls took him in hand. He ripens too quickly - as Sahibs reckon.'



<P>This prophecy was fulfilled to the letter a month later. Mahbub had

gone down to Umballa to bring up a fresh consignment of horses, and Kim

met him on the Kalka road at dusk riding alone, begged an alms of him,

was sworn at, and replied in English. There was nobody within earshot to

hear Mahbub's gasp of amazement.



<P>`Oho! And where hast thou been?'



<P>`Up and down - down and up.'



<P>`Come under a tree, out of the wet, and tell.'



<P>`I stayed for a while with an old man near Umballa; anon with a household

of my acquaintance in Umballa. With one of these I went as far as Delhi

to the southward. That is a wondrous city. Then I drove a bullock for a

<I>teli</I> [an oilman] coming north; but I heard of a great feast forward

in Patiala, and thither went I in the company of a firework-maker. It was

a great feast' (Kim rubbed his stomach). `I saw Rajahs, and elephants with

gold and silver trappings; and they lit all the fireworks at once, whereby

eleven men were killed, my firework-maker among them, and I was blown across

a tent but took no harm. Then I came back to the <I>r&amp;etilde;l</I>

with a Sikh horseman, to whom I was groom for my bread; and so here.'



<P>`<I>Shabash</I>!' said Mahbub Ali.



<P>`But what does the Colonel Sahib say? I do not wish to be beaten.'



<P>`The Hand of Friendship has averted the Whip of Calamity; but another

time, when thou takest the Road it will be with me. This is too early.'



<P>`Late enough for me. I have learned to read and to write English a little

at the <I>madrissah</I>. I shall soon be altogether a Sahib.'



<P>`Hear him!' laughed Mahbub, looking at the little drenched figure dancing

in the wet. `Salaam - Sahib,' and he saluted ironically. `Well, art tired

of the Road, or wilt thou come on to Umballa with me and work back with

the horses?'



<P>`I come with thee, Mahbub Ali.'

<P><I>Song of Diego Valdez.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

Very early in the morning the white tents came down and disappeared as

the Mavericks took a side-road to Umballa. It did not skirt the resting-place,

and Kim, trudging beside a baggage-cart under fire of comments from soldiers'

wives, was not so confident as overnight. He discovered that he was closely

watched - Father Victor on the one side, and Mr Bennett on the other.



<P>In the forenoon the column checked. A camel-orderly handed the Colonel

a letter. He read it, and spoke to a Major. Half a mile in the rear, Kim

heard a hoarse and joyful clamour rolling down on him through the thick

dust. Then someone beat him on the back, crying: `Tell us how ye knew,

ye little limb of Satan? Father dear, see if ye can make him tell.'



<P>A pony ranged alongside, and he was hauled on to the priest's saddle-bow.



<P>`Now, my son, your prophecy of last night has come true. Our orders

are to entrain at Umballa for the Front tomorrow.'



<P>`What is thatt?' said Kim, for <I>front</I> and <I>entrain</I> were

newish words to him.



<P>`We are going to `thee War,' as you called it.'



<P>`Of course you are going to thee War. I said last night.'



<P>`Ye did; but, Powers o' Darkness, how did ye know?'



<P>Kim's eyes sparkled. He shut his lips, nodded his head, and looked unspeakable

things. The Chaplain moved on through the dust, and privates, sergeants,

and subalterns called one another's attention to the boy. The Colonel,

at the head of the column, stared at him curiously. `It was probably some

bazar rumour,' he said; `but even then - ' He referred to the paper in

his hand. `Hang it all, the thing was only decided within the last forty-eight

hours.'



<P>`Are there many more like you in India?' said Father Victor, `or are

you by way o' being a <I>lusus naturae</I>?'



<P>`Now I have told you,' said the boy, `will you let me go back to my

old man? If he has not stayed with that woman from Kulu, I am afraid he

will die.'



<P>`By what I saw of him he's as well able to take care of himself as you.

No. Ye've brought us luck, an' we're goin' to make a man of you. I'll take

ye back to your baggage-cart and ye'll come to me this evening.'



<P>For the rest of the day Kim found himself an object of distinguished

consideration among a few hundred white men. The story of his appearance

in camp, the discovery of his parentage, and his prophecy, had lost nothing

in the telling. A big, shapeless white woman on a pile of bedding asked

him mysteriously whether he thought her husband would come back from the

war. Kim reflected gravely, and said that he would, and the woman gave

him food. In many respects, this big procession that played music at intervals

- this crowd that talked and laughed so easily - resembled a festival in

Lahore city. So far, there was no sign of hard work, and he resolved to

lend the spectacle his patronage. At evening there came out to meet them

bands of music, and played the Mavericks into camp near Umballa railway

station. That was an interesting night. Men of other regiments came to

visit the Mavericks. The Mavericks went visiting on their own account.

Their pickets hurried forth to bring them back, met pickets of strange

regiments on the same duty; and, after a while, the bugles blew madly for

more pickets with officers to control the tumult. The Mavericks had a reputation

for liveliness to live up to. But they fell in on the platform next morning

in perfect shape and condition; and Kim, left behind with the sick, women,

and boys, found himself shouting farewells excitedly as the trains drew

away. Life as a Sahib was amusing so far; but he touched it with a cautious

hand. Then they marched him back in charge of a drummer-boy to empty, lime-washed

barracks, whose floors were covered with rubbish and string and paper,

and whose ceilings gave back his lonely footfall. Native-fashion, he curled

himself up on a stripped cot and went to sleep. An angry man stumped down

the veranda, woke him up, and said he was a schoolmaster. This was enough

for Kim, and he retired into his shell. He could just puzzle out the various

English Police notices in Lahore city, because they affected his comfort;

and among the many guests of the woman who looked after him had been a

queer German who painted scenery for the Parsee travelling theatre. He

told Kim that he had been <I>on the barricades in 'Forty-eight,</I> and

therefore - at least that was how it struck Kim - he would teach the boy

to write in return for food. Kim had been kicked as far as single letters,

but did not think well of them.



<P>`I do not know anything. Go away!' said Kim, scenting evil. Hereupon

the man caught him by the ear, dragged him to a room in a far-off wing

where a dozen drummer-boys were sitting on forms, and told him to be still

if he could do nothing else. This he managed very successfully. The man

explained something or other with white lines on a black board for at least

half an hour, and Kim continued his interrupted nap. He much disapproved

of the present aspect of affairs, for this was the very school and discipline

he had spent two-thirds of his young life in avoiding. Suddenly a beautiful

idea occurred to him, and he wondered that he had not thought of it before.



<P>The man dismissed them, and first to spring through the veranda into

the open sunshine was Kim.



<P>`'Ere, you! `Alt! Stop!' said a high voice at his heels. `I've got to

look after you. My orders are not to let you out of my sight. Where are

you goin'?'



<P>It was the drummer-boy who had been hanging round him all the forenoon

- a fat and freckled person of about fourteen, and Kim loathed him from

the soles of his boots to his cap-ribbons.



<P>`To the bazar - to get sweets - for you,' said Kim, after thought.



<P>`Well, the bazar's out o' bounds. If we go there we'll get a dressing-down.

You come back.'



<P>`How near can we go?' Kim did not know what bounds meant, but he wished

to be polite - for the present.



<P>`'Ow near? 'Ow far, you mean! We can go as far as that tree down the

road.'



<P>`Then I will go there.'



<P>`All right. I ain't goin'. It's too 'ot. I can watch you from 'ere.

It's no good your runnin' away. If you did, they'd spot you by your clothes.

That's regimental stuff you're wearin'. There ain't a picket in Umballa

wouldn't 'ead you back quicker than you started out.'



<P>This did not impress Kim as much as the knowledge that his raiment would

tire him out if he tried to run. He slouched to the tree at the corner

of a bare road leading towards the bazar, and eyed the natives passing.

Most of them were barrack-servants of the lowest caste. Kim hailed a sweeper,

who promptly retorted with a piece of unnecessary insolence, in the natural

belief that the European boy could not follow it. The low, quick answer

undeceived him. Kim put his fettered soul into it, thankful for the late

chance to abuse somebody in the tongue he knew best. `And now, go to the

nearest letter-writer in the bazar and tell him to come here. I would write

a letter.'



<P>`But - but what manner of white man's son art thou to need a bazar letter-writer?

Is there not a schoolmaster in the barracks?'



<P>`Ay; and Hell is full of the same sort. Do my order, you you Od! Thy

mother was married under a basket! Servant of Lal Beg, (Kim knew the God

of the sweepers), `run on my business or we will talk again.'



<P>The sweeper shuffled off in haste. `There is a white boy by the barracks

waiting under a tree who is not a white boy,' he stammered to the first

bazar letter-writer he came across. `He needs thee.'



<P>`Will he pay?' said the spruce scribe, gathering up his desk and pens

and sealing-wax all in order.



<P>`I do not know. He is not like other boys. Go and see. It is well worth.'



<P>Kim danced with impatience when the slim young Kayeth hove in sight.

As soon as his voice could carry he cursed him volubly.



<P>`First I will take my pay,' the letter-writer said. `Bad words have

made the price higher. But who art thou, dressed in that fashion, to speak

in this fashion?'



<P>`Aha! That is in the letter which thou shalt write. Never was such a

tale. But I am in no haste. Another writer will serve me. Umballa city

is as full of them as is Lahore.'



<P>`Four annas,' said the writer, sitting down and spreading his cloth

in the shade of a deserted barrack-wing.



<P>Mechanically Kim squatted beside him - squatted as only the natives

can - in spite of the abominable clinging trousers.



<P>The writer regarded him sideways.



<P>`That is the price to ask of Sahibs,' said Kim. `Now fix me a true one.'



<P>`An anna and a half. How do I know, having written the letter, that

thou wilt not run away?'



<P>`I must not go beyond this tree, and there is also the stamp to be considered.'



<P>`I get no commission on the price of the stamp. Once more, what manner

of white boy art thou?'



<P>`That shall be said in the letter, which is to Mahbub Ali, the horse-dealer

in the Kashmir Serai, at Lahore. He is my friend.'



<P>`Wonder on wonder!' murmured the letter-writer, dipping a reed in the

inkstand. `To be written in Hindi?'



<P>`Assuredly. To Mahbub Ali then. Begin! `I have come down with the old

man as far as Umballa in the train. At Umballa I carried the news of the

bay mare's pedigree.'' After what he had seen in the garden, he was not

going to write of white stallions.



<P>`Slower a little. What has a bay mare to do... Is it Mahbub Ali, the

great dealer?'



<P>`Who else? I have been in his service. Take more ink. Again. `As the

order was, so I did it. We then went on foot towards Benares, but on the

third day we found a certain regiment.' Is that down?'



<P>`Ay, <I>pulton</I>,' murmured the writer, all ears.



<P>``I went into their camp and was caught, and by means of the charm about

my neck, which thou knowest, it was established that I was the son of some

man in the regiment: according to the prophecy of the Red Bull, which thou

knowest was common talk of our bazar.'' Kim waited for this shaft to sink

into the letter-writer's heart, cleared his throat, and continued: ``A

priest clothed me and gave me a new name... One priest, however, was a

fool. The clothes are very heavy, but I am a Sahib and my heart is heavy

too. They send me to a school and beat me. I do not like the air and water

here. Come then and help me, Mahbub Ali, or send me some money, for I have

not sufficient to pay the writer who writes this.''



<P>``Who writes this.' It is my own fault that I was tricked. Thou art

as clever as Husain Bux that forged the Treasury stamps at Nucklao. But

what a tale! What a tale! Is it true by any chance?'



<P>`It does not profit to tell lies to Mahbub Ali. It is better to help

his friends by lending them a stamp. When the money comes I will repay.'



<P>The writer grunted doubtfully, but took a stamp out of his desk, sealed

the letter, handed it over to Kim, and departed. Mahbub Ali's was a name

of power in Umballa.



<P>`That is the way to win a good account with the Gods,' Kim shouted after

him.



<P>`Pay me twice over when the money comes,' the man cried over his shoulder.



<P>`What was you bukkin' to that nigger about?' said the drummer-boy when

Kim returned to the veranda. `I was watchin' you.'



<P>`I was only talkin' to him.'



<P>`You talk the same as a nigger, don't you?'



<P>`No-ah! No-ah! I onlee speak a little. What shall we do now?'



<P>`The bugles'll go for dinner in arf a minute. My Gawd! I wish I'd gone

up to the Front with the Regiment. It's awful doin' nothin' but school

down `ere. Don't you `ate it?'



<P>`Oah yess!'



<P>`I'd run away if I knew where to go to, but, as the men say, in this

bloomin' Injia you're only a prisoner at large. You can't desert without

bein' took back at once. I'm fair sick of it.'



<P>`You have been in Be - England?'



<P>`W'y, I only come out last troopin' season with my mother. I should

think I '<I>ave</I> been in England. What a ignorant little beggar you

are! You was brought up in the gutter, wasn't you?'



<P>`Oah yess. Tell me something about England. My father he came from there.'



<P>Though he would not say so, Kim of course disbelieved every word the

drummer-boy spoke about the Liverpool suburb which was his England. It

passed the heavy time till dinner - a most unappetizing meal served to

the boys and a few invalids in a corner of a barrack-room. But that he

had written to Mahbub Ali, Kim would have been almost depressed. The indifference

of native crowds he was used to; but this strong loneliness among white

men preyed on him. He was grateful when, in the course of the afternoon,

a big soldier took him over to Father Victor, who lived in another wing

across another dusty parade-ground. The priest was reading an English letter

written in purple ink. He looked at Kim more curiously than ever.



<P>`An' how do you like it, my son, as far as you've gone? Not much, eh?

It must be hard - very hard on a wild animal. Listen now. I've an amazin'

epistle from your friend.'



<P>`Where is he? Is he well? Oah! If he knows to write me letters, it is

all right.'



<P>`You're fond of him then?'



<P>`Of course I am fond of him. He was fond of me.'



<P>`It seems so by the look of this. He can't write English, can he?'



<P>`Oah no. Not that I know, but <I>of</I> course he found a letter-writer

who can write English verree well, and so he wrote. I <I>do</I> hope you

understand.'



<P>`That accounts for it. D'you know anything about his money affairs?'

Kim's face showed that he did not.



<P>`How can I tell?'



<P>`That's what I'm askin'. Now listen if you can make head or tail o'

this. We'll skip the first part... It's written from Jagadhir Road...

Lama the priest of Such-zen looking for a River, address care of Tirthankars'

Temple, Benares. P.M. - Please note boy is apple of eye, and rupees shall

be sent per <I>hoondi</I> three hundred per annum. For God Almighty's sake.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Now, is that ravin' lunacy or a business proposition? I ask you, because

I'm fairly at my wits' end.'



<P>`He says he will give me three hundred rupees a year? So he will give

me them.'



<P>`Oh, that's the way you look at it, is it?'



<P>`<I>Of</I> course. If he says so!'



<P>The priest whistled; then he addressed Kim as an equal.



<P>`I don't believe it; but we'll see. You were goin' off today to the

Military Orphanage at Sanawar, where the Regiment would keep you till you

were old enough to enlist. Ye'd be brought up to the Church of England.

Bennett arranged for that. On the other hand, if ye go to St Xavier's ye'll

get a better education an' - an' can have the religion. D'ye see my dilemma?'



<P>Kim saw nothing save a vision of the lama going south in a train with

none to beg for him.



<P>`Like most people, I'm going to temporize. If your friend sends the

money from Benares - Powers of Darkness below, where's a street-beggar

to raise three hundred rupees? - ye'll go down to Lucknow and I'll pay

your fare, because I can't touch the subscription-money if I intend, as

I do, to make ye a Catholic. If he doesn't, ye'll go to the Military Orphanage

at the Regiment's expense. I'll allow him three days' grace, though I don't

believe it at all. Even then, if he fails in his payments later on... but

it's beyond me. We can only walk one step at a time in this world, praise

God! An' they sent Bennett to the Front an' left me behind. Bennett can't

expect everything.'



<P>`Oah yess,' said Kim vaguely.



<P>The priest leaned forward. `I'd give a month's pay to find what's goin'

on inside that little round head of yours.'



<P>`There is nothing,' said Kim, and scratched it. He was wondering whether

Mahbub Ali would send him as much as a whole rupee. Then he could pay the

letter-writer and write letters to the lama at Benares. Perhaps Mahbub

Ali would visit him next time he came south with horses. Surely he must

know that Kim's delivery of the letter to the officer at Umballa had caused

the great war which the men and boys had discussed so loudly over the barrack

dinner-tables. But if Mahbub Ali did not know this, it would be very unsafe

to tell him so. Mahbub Ali was hard upon boys who knew, or thought they

knew, too much.



<P>`Well, till I get further news' - Father Victor's voice interrupted

the reverie. `Ye can run along now and play with the other boys. They'll

teach ye something - but I don't think ye'll like it.'



<P>The day dragged to its weary end. When he wished to sleep he was instructed

how to fold up his clothes and set out his boots; the other boys deriding.

Bugles waked him in the dawn; the schoolmaster caught him after breakfast,

thrust a page of meaningless characters under his nose, gave them senseless

names, and whacked him without reason. Kim meditated poisoning him with

opium borrowed from a barrack-sweeper, but reflected that, as they all

ate at one table in public (this was peculiarly revolting to Kim, who preferred

to turn his back on the world at meals), the stroke might be dangerous.

Then he attempted running off to the village where the priest had tried

to drug the lama - the village where the old soldier lived. But far-seeing

sentries at every exit headed back the little scarlet figure. Trousers

and jacket crippled body and mind alike, so he abandoned the project and

fell back, Oriental-fashion, on time and chance. Three days of torment

passed in the big, echoing white rooms. He walked out of afternoons under

escort of the drummer-boy, and all he heard from his companions were the

few useless words which seemed to make two-thirds of the white man's abuse.

Kim knew and despised them all long ago. The boy resented his silence and

lack of interest by beating him, as was only natural. He did not care for

any of the bazars which were in bounds. He styled all natives `niggers';

yet servants and sweepers called him abominable names to his face, and,

misled by their deferential attitude, he never understood. This somewhat

consoled Kim for the beatings.



<P>On the morning of the fourth day a judgement overtook that drummer.

They had gone out together towards Umballa racecourse. He returned alone,

weeping, with news that young O'Hara, to whom he had been doing nothing

in particular, had hailed a scarlet-bearded nigger on horseback; that the

nigger had then and there laid into him with a peculiarly adhesive quirt,

picked up young O'Hara, and borne him off at full gallop. These tidings

came to Father Victor, and he drew down his long upper lip. He was already

sufficiently startled by a letter from the Temple of the Tirthankars at

Benares, enclosing a native banker's note of hand for three hundred rupees,

and an amazing prayer to <I>Almighty God</I>. The lama would have been

more annoyed than the priest had he known how the bazar letter-writer had

translated his phrase <I>to acquire merit</I>.



<P>`Powers of Darkness below!' Father Victor fumbled with the note. `An'

now he's off with another of his peep-o'-day friends. I don't know whether

it will be a greater relief to me to get him back or to have him lost.

He's beyond my comprehension. How the Divil - yes, <I>he's</I> the man

I mean - can a street-beggar raise money to educate white boys?'



<P>Three miles off, on Umballa racecourse, Mahbub Ali, reining a grey Kabuli

stallion with Kim in front of him, was saying:



<P>`But, Little Friend of all the World, there is <I>my</I> honour and

reputation to be considered. All the officer-Sahibs in all the regiments,

and all Umballa, know Mahbub Ali. Men saw me pick thee up and chastise

that boy. We are seen now from far across this plain. How can I take thee

away, or account for thy disappearing if I set thee down and let thee run

off into the crops? They would put me in jail. Be patient. Once a Sahib,

always a Sahib. When thou art a man - who knows? - thou wilt be grateful

to Mahbub Ali.'



<P>`Take me beyond their sentries where I can change this red. Give me

money and I will go to Benares and be with my lama again. I do not want

to be a Sahib, and remember I <I>did</I> deliver that message.'



<P>The stallion bounded wildly. Mahbub Ali had incautiously driven home

the sharp-edged stirrup. (He was not the new sort of fluent horse-dealer

who wears English boots and spurs.) Kim drew his own conclusions from that

betrayal.



<P>`That was a small matter. It lay on the straight road to Benares. I

and the Sahib have by this time forgotten it. I send so many letters and

messages to men who ask questions about horses, I cannot well remember

one from the other. Was it some matter of a bay mare that Peters Sahib

wished the pedigree of?'



<P>Kim saw the trap at once. If he had said <I>bay mare</I> Mahbub would

have known by his very readiness to fall in with the amendment that the

boy suspected something. Kim replied therefore:



<P>`Bay mare. No. <I>I</I> do not forget my messages thus. It was a white

stallion.'



<P>`Ay, so it was. A white Arab stallion. But thou didst write <I>bay mare</I>

to me.'



<P>`Who cares to tell truth to a letter-writer?' Kim answered, feeling

Mahbub's palm on his heart.



<P>`Hi! Mahbub, you old villain, pull up!' cried a voice, and an Englishman

raced alongside on a little polo-pony. `I've been chasing you half over

the country. That Kabuli of yours can go. For sale, I suppose?'



<P>`I have some young stuff coming on made by Heaven for the delicate and

difficult polo-game. He has no equal. He - '



<P>`Plays polo and waits at table. Yes. We know all that. What the deuce

have you got there?'



<P>`A boy,' said Mahbub gravely. `He was being beaten by another boy. His

father was once a white soldier in the big war. The boy was a child in

Lahore city. He played with my horses when he was a babe. Now I think they

will make him a soldier. He has been newly caught by his father's Regiment

that went up to the war last week. But I do not think he wants to be a

soldier. I take him for a ride. Tell me where thy barracks are and I will

set thee there.'



<P>`Let me go. I can find the barracks alone.'



<P>`And if thou runnest away who will say it is not my fault?'



<P>`He'll run back to his dinner. Where has he to run to?' the Englishman

asked.



<P>`He was born in the land. He has friends. He goes where he chooses.

He is a <I>chabuk sawai</I> [a sharp chap]. It needs only to change his

clothing, and in a twinkling he would be a low-caste Hindu boy.'



<P>`The deuce he would!' The Englishman looked critically at the boy as

Mahbub headed towards the barracks. Kim ground his teeth. Mahbub was mocking

him, as faithless Afghans will; for he went on:



<P>`They will send him to a school and put heavy boots on his feet and

swaddle him in these clothes. Then he will forget all he knows. Now, which

of the barracks is thine?'



<P>Kim pointed - he could not speak - to Father Victor's wing, all staring

white near by.



<P>`Perhaps he will make a good soldier,' said Mahbub reflectively. `He

will make a good orderly at least. I sent him to deliver a message once

from Lahore. A message concerning the pedigree of a white stallion.'



<P>Here was deadly insult on deadlier injury - and the Sahib to whom he

had so craftily given that war-waking letter heard it all. Kim beheld Mahbub

Ali frying in flame for his treachery, but for himself he saw one long

grey vista of barracks, schools, and barracks again. He gazed imploringly

at the clear-cut face in which there was no glimmer of recognition; but

even at this extremity it never occurred to him to throw himself on the

white man's mercy or to denounce the Afghan. And Mahbub stared deliberately

at the Englishman, who stared as deliberately at Kim, quivering and tongue-tied.



<P>`My horse is well trained,' said the dealer. `Others would have kicked,

Sahib.'



<P>`Ah,' said the Englishman at last, rubbing his pony's damp withers with

his whip-butt. `Who makes the boy a soldier?'



<P>`He says the Regiment that found him, and especially the Padre-sahib

of that regiment.'



<P>`There is the Padre!' Kim choked as bare-headed Father Victor sailed

down upon them from the veranda.



<P>`Powers o' Darkness below, O'Hara! How many more mixed friends do you

keep in Asia?' he cried, as Kim slid down and stood helplessly before him.



<P>`Good morning, Padre,' the Englishman said cheerily. `I know you by

reputation well enough. Meant to have come over and called before this.

I'm Creighton.'



<P>`Of the Ethnological Survey?' said Father Victor. The Englishman nodded.

`Faith, I'm glad to meet ye then; an' I owe you some thanks for bringing

back the boy.'



<P>`No thanks to me, Padre. Besides, the boy wasn't going away. You don't

know old Mahbub Ali.' The horse-dealer sat impassive in the sunlight. `You

will when you have been in the station a month. He sells us all our crocks.

That boy is rather a curiosity. Can you tell me anything about him?'



<P>`Can I tell you?' puffed Father Victor. `You'll be the one man that

could help me in my quandaries. Tell you! Powers o' Darkness, I'm bursting

to tell someone who knows something o' the native!'



<P>A groom came round the corner. Colonel Creighton raised his voice, speaking

in Urdu. `Very good, Mahbub Ali, but what is the use of telling me all

those stories about the pony? Not one pice more than three hundred and

fifty rupees will I give.'



<P>`The Sahib is a little hot and angry after riding,' the horse-dealer

returned, with the leer of a privileged jester. `Presently, he will see

my horse's points more clearly. I will wait till he has finished his talk

with the Padre. I will wait under that tree.'



<P>`Confound you!' The Colonel laughed. `That comes of looking at one of

Mahbub's horses. He's a regular old leech, Padre. Wait, then, if thou hast

so much time to spare, Mahbub. Now I'm at your service, Padre. Where is

the boy? Oh, he's gone off to collogue with Mahbub. Queer sort of boy.

Might I ask you to send my mare round under cover?'



<P>He dropped into a chair which commanded a clear view of Kim and Mahbub

Ali in conference beneath the tree. The Padre went indoors for cheroots.



<P>Creighton heard Kim say bitterly: `Trust a Brahmin before a snake, and

a snake before an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan, Mahbub Ali.'



<P>`That is all one.' The great red beard wagged solemnly. `Children should

not see a carpet on the loom till the pattern is made plain. Believe me,

Friend of all the World, I do thee great service. They will not make a

soldier of thee.'



<P>`You crafty old sinner!' thought Creighton. `But you're not far wrong.

That boy mustn't be wasted if he is as advertised.'



<P>`Excuse me half a minute,' cried the Padre from within, `but I'm gettin'

the documents in the case.'



<P>`If through me the favour of this bold and wise Colonel Sahib comes

to thee, and thou art raised to honour, what thanks wilt thou give Mahbub

Ali when thou art a man?'



<P>`Nay, nay! I begged thee to let me take the Road again, where I should

have been safe; and thou hast sold me back to the English. What will they

give thee for blood-money?'



<P>`A cheerful young demon!' The Colonel bit his cigar, and turned politely

to Father Victor.



<P>`What are the letters that the fat priest is waving before the Colonel?

Stand behind the stallion as though looking at my bridle!' said Mahbub

Ali.



<P>`A letter from my lama which he wrote from Jagadhir Road, saying that

he will pay three hundred rupees by the year for my schooling.'



<P>`Oho! Is old Red Hat of that sort? At which school?'



<P>`God knows. I think in Nucklao.'



<P>`Yes. There is a big school there for the sons of Sahibs - and half-Sahibs.

I have seen it when I sell horses there. So the lama also loved the Friend

of all the World?'



<P>`Ay; and <I>he</I> did not tell lies, or return me to captivity.'



<P>`Small wonder the Padre does not know how to unravel the thread. How

fast he talks to the Colonel Sahib!' Mahbub Ali chuckled. `By Allah!' -

the keen eyes swept the veranda for an instant - `thy lama has sent what

to me looks like a note of hand. I have had some few dealings in <I>hoondis</I>.

The Colonel Sahib is looking at it.'



<P>`What good is all this to me?' said Kim wearily. `Thou wilt go away,

and they will return me to those empty rooms where there is no good place

to sleep and where the boys beat me.'



<P>`I do not think that. Have patience, child. All Pathans are not faithless

- except in horseflesh.'



<P>Five - ten - fifteen minutes passed, Father Victor talking energetically

or asking questions which the Colonel answered.



<P>`Now I've told you everything that I know about the boy from beginnin'

to end; and it's a blessed relief to me. Did ye ever hear the like?'



<P>`At any rate, the old man has sent the money. Gobind Sahai's notes of

hand are good from here to China,' said the Colonel. `The more one knows

about natives the less can one say what they will or won't do.'



<P>`That's consolin' - from the head of the Ethnological Survey. It's this

mixture of Red Bulls and Rivers of Healing (poor heathen, God help him!)

an' notes of hand and Masonic certificates. Are you a Mason, by any chance?'



<P>`By Jove, I am, now I come to think of it. That's an additional reason,'

said the Colonel absently.



<P>`I'm glad ye see a reason in it. But as I said, it's the mixture o'

things that's beyond me. An' his prophesyin' to our Colonel, sitting on

my bed with his little shimmy torn open showing his white skin; an' the

prophecy comin' true! They'll cure all that nonsense at St Xavier's, eh?'



<P>`Sprinkle him with holy water,' the Colonel laughed.



<P>`On my word, I fancy I ought to sometimes. But I'm hoping he'll be brought

up as a good Catholic. All that troubles me is what'll happen if the old

beggar-man - '



<P>`Lama, lama, my dear sir; and some of them are gentlemen in their own

country.'



<P>`The lama, then, fails to pay next year. He's a fine business head to

plan on the spur of the moment, but he's bound to die some day. An' takin'

a heathen's money to give a child a Christian education - '



<P>`But he said explicitly what he wanted. As soon as he knew the boy was

white he seems to have made his arrangements accordingly. I'd give a month's

pay to hear how he explained it all at the Tirthankars' Temple at Benares.

Look here, Padre, I don't pretend to know much about natives, but if he

says he'll pay, he'll pay - dead or alive. I mean, his heirs will assume

the debt. My advice to you is, send the boy down to Lucknow. If your Anglican

Chaplain thinks you've stolen a march on him - '



<P>`Bad luck to Bennett! He was sent to the Front instead o' me. Doughty

certified me medically unfit. I'll excommunicate Doughty if he comes back

alive! Surely Bennett ought to be content with - '



<P>`Glory, leaving you the religion. Quite so! As a matter of fact I don't

think Bennett will mind. Put the blame on me. I - er - strongly recommend

sending the boy to St Xavier's. He can go down on pass as a soldier's orphan,

so the railway fare will be saved. You can buy him an outfit from the Regimental

subscription The Lodge will be saved the expense of his education, and

that will put the Lodge in a good temper. It's perfectly easy. I've got

to go down to Lucknow next week. I'll look after the boy on the way - give

him in charge of my servants, and so on.'



<P>`You're a good man.'



<P>`Not in the least. Don't make that mistake. The lama has sent us money

for a definite end. We can't very well return it. We shall have to do as

he says. Well, that's settled, isn't it? Shall we say that, Tuesday next,

you'll hand him over to me at the night train south? That's only three

days. He can't do much harm in three days.'



<P>`It's a weight off my mind, but - this thing here?' - he waved the note

of hand - `I don't know Gobind Sahai: or his bank, which may be a hole

in a wall.'



<P>`<I>You've</I> never been a subaltern in debt. I'll cash it if you like,

and send you the vouchers in proper order.'



<P>`But with all your own work too! It's askin' - '



<P>`It's not the least trouble indeed. You see, as an ethnologist, the

thing's very interesting to me. I'd like to make a note of it for some

Government work that I'm doing. The transformation of a regimental badge

like your Red Bull into a sort of fetish that the boy follows is very interesting.'



<P>`But I can't thank you enough.'



<P>`There's one thing you can do. All we Ethnological men are as jealous

as jackdaws of one another's discoveries. They're of no interest to anyone

but ourselves, of course, but you know what book-collectors are like. Well,

don't say a word, directly or indirectly, about the Asiatic side of the

boy's character - his adventures and his prophecy, and so on. I'll worm

them out of the boy later on and - you see?'



<P>`I do. Ye'll make a wonderful account of it. Never a word will I say

to anyone till I see it in print.'



<P>`Thank you. That goes straight to an ethnologist's heart. Well, I must

be getting back to my breakfast. Good Heavens! Old Mahbub here still?'

He raised his voice, and the horse-dealer came out from under the shadow

of the tree, `Well, what is it?'



<P>`As regards that young horse,' said Mahbub, `I say that when a colt

is born to be a polo-pony, closely following the ball without teaching

- when such a colt knows the game by divination - then I say it is a great

wrong to break that colt to a heavy cart, Sahib!'



<P>`So say I also, Mahbub. The colt will be entered for polo only. (These

fellows think of nothing in the world but horses, Padre.) I'll see you

tomorrow, Mahbub, if you've anything likely for sale.'



<P>The dealer saluted, horseman-fashion, with a sweep of the off hand.

`Be patient a little, Friend of all the World,' he whispered to the agonized

Kim. `Thy fortune is made. In a little while thou goest to Nucklao, and

- here is something to pay the letter-writer. I shall see thee again, I

think, many times,' and he cantered off down the road.



<P>`Listen to me,' said the Colonel from the veranda, speaking in the vernacular.

`In three days thou wilt go with me to Lucknow, seeing and hearing new

things all the while. Therefore sit still for three days and do not run

away. Thou wilt go to school at Lucknow.'



<P>`Shall I meet my Holy One there?' Kim whimpered.



<P>`At least Lucknow is nearer to Benares than Umballa. It may be thou

wilt go under my protection. Mahbub Ali knows this, and he will be angry

if thou returnest to the Road now. Remember - much has been told me which

I do not forget.'



<P>`I will wait,' said Kim, `but the boys will beat me.'



<P>Then the bugles blew for dinner.
