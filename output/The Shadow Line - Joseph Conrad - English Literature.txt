<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>WITH her anchor at the bow and clothed in canvas

<BR>to her very trucks, my command seemed to stand

<BR>as motionless as a model ship set on the gleams and

<BR>shadows of polished marble.&nbsp; It was impossible

<BR>to distinguish land from water in the enigmatical

<BR>tranquillity of the immense forces of the world.

<BR>A sudden impatience possessed me.



<P>"Won't she answer the helm at all?" I said

<BR>irritably to the man whose strong brown hands

<BR>grasping the spokes of the wheel stood out lighted

<BR>on the darkness; like a symbol of mankind's claim

<BR>to the direction of its own fate.



<P>He answered me.



<P>"Yes, sir.&nbsp; She's coming-to slowly."



<P>"Let her head come up to south."



<P>"Aye, aye, sir."



<P>I paced the poop.&nbsp; There was not a sound but

<BR>that of my footsteps, till the man spoke again.



<P>"She is at south now, sir."



<P>I felt a slight tightness of the chest before I gave

<BR>out the first course of my first command to the

<BR>silent night, heavy with dew and sparkling with

<BR>stars.&nbsp; There was a finality in the act commit-

<BR>ting me to the endless vigilance of my lonely task.



<P>"Steady her head at that," I said at last.&nbsp; "The

<BR>course is south."



<P>"South, sir," echoed the man.



<P>I sent below the second mate and his watch and

<BR>remained in charge, walking the deck through the

<BR>chill, somnolent hours that precede the dawn.



<P>Slight puffs came and went, and whenever they

<BR>were strong enough to wake up the black water the

<BR>murmur alongside ran through my very heart in a

<BR>delicate crescendo of delight and died away swiftly.

<BR>I was bitterly tired.&nbsp; The very stars seemed weary

<BR>of waiting for daybreak.&nbsp; It came at last with a

<BR>mother-of-pearl sheen at the zenith, such as I had

<BR>never seen before in the tropics, unglowing, almost

<BR>gray, with a strange reminder of high latitudes.



<P>The voice of the look-out man hailed from for-

<BR>ward:



<P>"Land on the port bow, sir."



<P>"All right."



<P>Leaning on the rail I never even raised my eyes.



<P>The motion of the ship was imperceptible.&nbsp; Pres-

<BR>ently Ransome brought me the cup of morning

<BR>coffee.&nbsp; After I had drunk it I looked ahead, and in

<BR>the still streak of very bright pale orange light I

<BR>saw the land profiled flatly as if cut out of black

<BR>paper and seeming to float on the water as light as

<BR>cork.&nbsp; But the rising sun turned it into mere dark

<BR>vapour, a doubtful, massive shadow trembling in

<BR>the hot glare.



<P>The watch finished washing decks.&nbsp; I went be-

<BR>low and stopped at Mr. Burns' door (he could not

<BR>bear to have it shut), but hesitated to speak to him

<BR>till he moved his eyes.&nbsp; I gave him the news.



<P>"Sighted Cape Liant at daylight.&nbsp; About fifteen

<BR>miles."



<P>He moved his lips then, but I heard no sound

<BR>till I put my ear down, and caught the peevish

<BR>comment: "This is crawling. . . .&nbsp; No luck."



<P>"Better luck than standing still, anyhow," I

<BR>pointed out resignedly, and left him to whatever

<BR>thoughts or fancies haunted his awful immobility.



<P>Later that morning, when relieved by my second

<BR>officer, I threw myself on my couch and for some

<BR>three hours or so I really found oblivion.&nbsp; It was so

<BR>perfect that on waking up I wondered where I was.

<BR>Then came the immense relief of the thought: on

<BR>board my ship!&nbsp; At sea!&nbsp; At sea!



<P>Through the port-holes I beheld an unruffled,

<BR>sun-smitten horizon.&nbsp; The horizon of a windless

<BR>day.&nbsp; But its spaciousness alone was enough to

<BR>give me a sense of a fortunate escape, a momentary

<BR>exultation of freedom.



<P>I stepped out into the saloon with my heart

<BR>lighter than it had been for days.&nbsp; Ransome was at

<BR>the sideboard preparing to lay the table for the first

<BR>sea dinner of the passage.&nbsp; He turned his head, and

<BR>something in his eyes checked my modest elation.



<P>Instinctively I asked: "What is it now?" not ex-

<BR>pecting in the least the answer I got.&nbsp; It was given

<BR>with that sort of contained serenity which was

<BR>characteristic of the man.



<P>"I am afraid we haven't left all sickness behind

<BR>us, sir."



<P>"We haven't!&nbsp; What's the matter?"



<P>He told me then that two of our men had been

<BR>taken bad with fever in the night.&nbsp; One of them

<BR>was burning and the other was shivering, but he

<BR>thought that it was pretty much the same thing.

<BR>I thought so, too.&nbsp; I felt shocked by the news.

<BR>"One burning, the other shivering, you say?&nbsp; No.

<BR>We haven't left the sickness behind.&nbsp; Do they look

<BR>very ill?"



<P>"Middling bad, sir."&nbsp; Ransome's eyes gazed

<BR>steadily into mine.&nbsp; We exchanged smiles.&nbsp; Ran-

<BR>some's a little wistful, as usual, mine no doubt grim

<BR>enough, to correspond with my secret exasperation.



<P>I asked:



<P>"Was there any wind at all this morning?"



<P>"Can hardly say that, sir.&nbsp; We've moved all the

<BR>time though.&nbsp; The land ahead seems a little nearer."



<P>That was it.&nbsp; A little nearer.&nbsp; Whereas if we

<BR>had only had a little more wind, only a very little

<BR>more, we might, we should, have been abreast of

<BR>Liant by this time and increasing our distance from

<BR>that contaminated shore.&nbsp; And it was not only the

<BR>distance.&nbsp; It seemed to me that a stronger breeze

<BR>would have blown away the contamination which

<BR>clung to the ship.&nbsp; It obviously did cling to the

<BR>ship.&nbsp; Two men.&nbsp; One burning, one shivering.&nbsp; I

<BR>felt a distinct reluctance to go and look at them.

<BR>What was the good?&nbsp; Poison is poison.&nbsp; Tropical

<BR>fever is tropical fever.&nbsp; But that it should have

<BR>stretched its claw after us over the sea seemed to

<BR>me an extraordinary and unfair license.&nbsp; I could

<BR>hardly believe that it could be anything worse than

<BR>the last desperate pluck of the evil from which we

<BR>were escaping into the clean breath of the sea.&nbsp; If

<BR>only that breath had been a little stronger.&nbsp; How-

<BR>ever, there was the quinine against the fever.&nbsp; I

<BR>went into the spare cabin where the medicine chest

<BR>was kept to prepare two doses.&nbsp; I opened it full of

<BR>faith as a man opens a miraculous shrine.&nbsp; The

<BR>upper part was inhabited by a collection of bottles,

<BR>all square-shouldered and as like each other as

<BR>peas.&nbsp; Under that orderly array there were two

<BR>drawers, stuffed as full of things as one could im-

<BR>agine--paper packages, bandages, cardboard boxes

<BR>officially labelled.&nbsp; The lower of the two, in one

<BR>of its compartments, contained our provision of

<BR>quinine.



<P>There were five bottles, all round and all of a

<BR>size.&nbsp; One was about a third full.&nbsp; The other four

<BR>remained still wrapped up in paper and sealed.

<BR>But I did not expect to see an envelope lying on top

<BR>of them.&nbsp; A square envelope, belonging, in fact, to

<BR>the ship's stationery.



<P>It lay so that I could see it was not closed down,

<BR>and on picking it up and turning it over I perceived

<BR>that it was addressed to myself.&nbsp; It contained a

<BR>half-sheet of notepaper, which I unfolded with a

<BR>queer sense of dealing with the uncanny, but with-

<BR>out any excitement as people meet and do ex-

<BR>traordinary things in a dream.



<P>"My dear Captain," it began, but I ran to the

<BR>signature.&nbsp; The writer was the doctor.&nbsp; The date

<BR>was that of the day on which, returning from my

<BR>visit to Mr. Burns in the hospital, I had found the

<BR>excellent doctor waiting for me in the cabin; and

<BR>when he told me that he had been putting in

<BR>time inspecting the medicine chest for me.&nbsp; How

<BR>bizarre!&nbsp; While expecting me to come in at any

<BR>moment he had been amusing himself by writing

<BR>me a letter, and then as I came in had hastened to

<BR>stuff it into the medicine-chest drawer.&nbsp; A rather

<BR>incredible proceeding.&nbsp; I turned to the text in

<BR>wonder.



<P>In a large, hurried, but legible hand the good,

<BR>sympathetic man for some reason, either of kind-

<BR>ness or more likely impelled by the irresistible de-

<BR>sire to express his opinion, with which he didn't

<BR>want to damp my hopes before, was warning me

<BR>not to put my trust in the beneficial effects of a

<BR>change from land to sea.&nbsp; "I didn't want to add to

<BR>your worries by discouraging your hopes," he

<BR>wrote.&nbsp; "I am afraid that, medically speaking, the

<BR>end of your troubles is not yet."&nbsp; In short, he ex-

<BR>pected me to have to fight a probable return of

<BR>tropical illness.&nbsp; Fortunately I had a good pro-

<BR>vision of quinine.&nbsp; I should put my trust in that,

<BR>and administer it steadily, when the ship's health

<BR>would certainly improve.



<P>I crumpled up the letter and rammed it into my

<BR>pocket.&nbsp; Ransome carried off two big doses to the

<BR>men forward.&nbsp; As to myself, I did not go on deck as

<BR>yet.&nbsp; I went instead to the door of Mr. Burns'

<BR>room, and gave him that news, too.



<P>It was impossible to say the effect it had on him.

<BR>At first I thought that he was speechless.&nbsp; His head

<BR>lay sunk in the pillow.&nbsp; He moved his lips enough,

<BR>however, to assure me that he was getting much

<BR>stronger; a statement shockingly untrue on the

<BR>face of it.



<P>That afternoon I took my watch as a matter of

<BR>course.&nbsp; A great over-heated stillness enveloped

<BR>the ship and seemed to hold her motionless in a

<BR>flaming ambience composed in two shades of blue.

<BR>Faint, hot puffs eddied nervelessly from her sails.

<BR>And yet she moved.&nbsp; She must have.&nbsp; For, as the

<BR>sun was setting, we had drawn abreast of Cape

<BR>Liant and dropped it behind us: an ominous re-

<BR>treating shadow in the last gleams of twilight.



<P>In the evening, under the crude glare of his lamp,

<BR>Mr. Burns seemed to have come more to the surface

<BR>of his bedding.&nbsp; It was as if a depressing hand had

<BR>been lifted off him.&nbsp; He answered my few words

<BR>by a comparatively long, connected speech.&nbsp; He

<BR>asserted himself strongly.&nbsp; If he escaped being

<BR>smothered by this stagnant heat, he said, he was

<BR>confident that in a very few days he would be able

<BR>to come up on deck and help me.



<P>While he was speaking I trembled lest this effort

<BR>of energy should leave him lifeless before my eyes.

<BR>But I cannot deny that there was something com-

<BR>forting in his willingness.&nbsp; I made a suitable

<BR>reply, but pointed out to him that the only thing

<BR>that could really help us was wind--a fair wind.



<P>He rolled his head impatiently on the pillow.

<BR>And it was not comforting in the least to hear him

<BR>begin to mutter crazily about the late captain, that

<BR>old man buried in latitude 8 d 20', right in our way

<BR>--ambushed at the entrance of the Gulf.



<P>"Are you still thinking of your late captain, Mr.

<BR>Burns?" I said.&nbsp; "I imagine the dead feel no animos-

<BR>ity against the living.&nbsp; They care nothing for them."



<P>"You don't know that one," he breathed out

<BR>feebly.



<P>"No.&nbsp; I didn't know him, and he didn't know

<BR>me.&nbsp; And so he can't have any grievance against

<BR>me, anyway."



<P>"Yes.&nbsp; But there's all the rest of us on board," he

<BR>insisted.



<P>I felt the inexpugnable strength of common sense

<BR>being insidiously menaced by this gruesome, by

<BR>this insane, delusion.&nbsp; And I said:



<P>"You mustn't talk so much.&nbsp; You will tire yourself."



<P>"And there is the ship herself," he persisted in a whisper.



<P>"Now, not a word more," I said, stepping in and

<BR>laying my hand on his cool forehead.&nbsp; It proved to

<BR>me that this atrocious absurdity was rooted in the

<BR>man himself and not in the disease, which, ap-

<BR>parently, had emptied him of every power, mental

<BR>and physical, except that one fixed idea.



<P>I avoided giving Mr. Burns any opening for con-

<BR>versation for the next few days.&nbsp; I merely used to

<BR>throw him a hasty, cheery word when passing his

<BR>door.&nbsp; I believe that if he had had the strength he

<BR>would have called out after me more than once.

<BR>But he hadn't the strength.&nbsp; Ransome, however,

<BR>observed to me one afternoon that the mate

<BR>"seemed to be picking up wonderfully."



<P>"Did he talk any nonsense to you of late?" I

<BR>asked casually.



<P>"No, sir."&nbsp; Ransome was startled by the direct

<BR>question; but, after a pause, he added equably:

<BR>"He told me this morning, sir, that he was sorry he

<BR>had to bury our late captain right in the ship's

<BR>way, as one may say, out of the Gulf."



<P>"Isn't this nonsense enough for you?" I asked,

<BR>looking confidently at the intelligent, quiet face on

<BR>which the secret uneasiness in the man's breast

<BR>had thrown a transparent veil of care.



<P>Ransome didn't know.&nbsp; He had not given a

<BR>thought to the matter.&nbsp; And with a faint smile he

<BR>flitted away from me on his never-ending duties,

<BR>with his usual guarded activity.



<P>Two more days passed.&nbsp; We had advanced a

<BR>little way--a very little way--into the larger space

<BR>of the Gulf of Siam.&nbsp; Seizing eagerly upon the

<BR>elation of the first command thrown into my lap,

<BR>by the agency of Captain Giles, I had yet an uneasy

<BR>feeling that such luck as this has got perhaps to be

<BR>paid for in some way.&nbsp; I had held, professionally, a

<BR>review of my chances.&nbsp; I was competent enough

<BR>for that.&nbsp; At least, I thought so.&nbsp; I had a general

<BR>sense of my preparedness which only a man pur-

<BR>suing a calling he loves can know.&nbsp; That feeling

<BR>seemed to me the most natural thing in the world.

<BR>As natural as breathing.&nbsp; I imagined I could not

<BR>have lived without it.



<P>I don't know what I expected.&nbsp; Perhaps nothing

<BR>else than that special intensity of existence which is

<BR>the quintessence of youthful aspirations.&nbsp; What-

<BR>ever I expected I did not expect to be beset by

<BR>hurricanes.&nbsp; I knew better than that.&nbsp; In the Gulf

<BR>of Siam there are no hurricanes.&nbsp; But neither did I

<BR>expect to find myself bound hand and foot to the

<BR>hopeless extent which was revealed to me as the

<BR>days went on.



<P>Not that the evil spell held us always motionless.

<BR>Mysterious currents drifted us here and there, with

<BR>a stealthy power made manifest only by the chang-

<BR>ing vistas of the islands fringing the east shore of

<BR>the Gulf.&nbsp; And there were winds, too, fitful and

<BR>deceitful.&nbsp; They raised hopes only to dash them

<BR>into the bitterest disappointment, promises of

<BR>advance ending in lost ground, expiring in sighs,

<BR>dying into dumb stillness in which the currents

<BR>had it all their own way--their own inimical

<BR>way.



<P>The island of Koh-ring, a great, black, up-

<BR>heaved ridge amongst a lot of tiny islets, lying

<BR>upon the glassy water like a triton amongst min-

<BR>nows, seemed to be the centre of the fatal circle.&nbsp; It

<BR>seemed impossible to get away from it.&nbsp; Day after

<BR>day it remained in sight.&nbsp; More than once, in a

<BR>favourable breeze, I would take its bearings in the

<BR>fast-ebbing twilight, thinking that it was for the

<BR>last time.&nbsp; Vain hope.&nbsp; A night of fitful airs would

<BR>undo the gains of temporary favour, and the rising

<BR>sun would throw out the black relief of Koh-ringooking.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>I HEARD the clatter of the scissors escaping from

<BR>his hand, noted the perilous heave of his whole

<BR>person over the edge of the bunk after them, and

<BR>then, returning to my first purpose, pursued my

<BR>course on the deck.&nbsp; The sparkle of the sea filled

<BR>my eyes.&nbsp; It was gorgeous and barren, monotonous

<BR>and without hope under the empty curve of the

<BR>sky.&nbsp; The sails hung motionless and slack, the

<BR>very folds of their sagging surfaces moved no more

<BR>than carved granite.&nbsp; The impetuosity of my ad-

<BR>vent made the man at the helm start slightly.&nbsp; A

<BR>block aloft squeaked incomprehensibly, for what

<BR>on earth could have made it do so?&nbsp; It was a

<BR>whistling note like a bird's.&nbsp; For a long, long time

<BR>I faced an empty world, steeped in an infinity of

<BR>silence, through which the sunshine poured and

<BR>flowed for some mysterious purpose.&nbsp; Then I heard

<BR>Ransome's voice at my elbow.



<P>"I have put Mr. Burns back to bed, sir."



<P>"You have."



<P>"Well, sir, he got out, all of a sudden, but when

<BR>he let go the edge of his bunk he fell down.&nbsp; He

<BR>isn't light-headed, though, it seems to me."



<P>"No," I said dully, without looking at Ransome.

<BR>He waited for a moment, then cautiously, as if not

<BR>to give offence: "I don't think we need lose much

<BR>of that stuff, sir," he said, "I can sweep it up, every

<BR>bit of it almost, and then we could sift the glass out.

<BR>I will go about it at once.&nbsp; It will not make the

<BR>breakfast late, not ten minutes."



<P>"Oh, yes," I said bitterly.&nbsp; "Let the breakfast

<BR>wait, sweep up every bit of it, and then throw

<BR>the damned lot overboard!"



<P>The profound silence returned, and when I

<BR>looked over my shoulder, Ransome--the intelli-

<BR>gent, serene Ransome--had vanished from my

<BR>side.&nbsp; The intense loneliness of the sea acted like

<BR>poison on my brain.&nbsp; When I turned my eyes to the

<BR>ship, I had a morbid vision of her as a floating

<BR>grave.&nbsp; Who hasn't heard of ships found floating,

<BR>haphazard, with their crews all dead?&nbsp; I looked at

<BR>the seaman at the helm, I had an impulse to speak

<BR>to him, and, indeed, his face took on an expectant

<BR>cast as if he had guessed my intention.&nbsp; But in the

<BR>end I went below, thinking I would be alone with

<BR>the greatness of my trouble for a little while.&nbsp; But

<BR>through his open door Mr. Burns saw me come down,

<BR>and addressed me grumpily: "Well, sir?"



<P>I went in.&nbsp; "It isn't well at all," I said.



<P>Mr. Burns, reestablished in his bed-place, was

<BR>concealing his hirsute cheek in the palm of his

<BR>hand.



<P>"That confounded fellow has taken away the

<BR>scissors from me," were the next words he said.



<P>The tension I was suffering from was so great

<BR>that it was perhaps just as well that Mr. Burns had

<BR>started on his grievance.&nbsp; He seemed very sore

<BR>about it and grumbled, "Does he think I am mad,

<BR>or what?"



<P>"I don't think so, Mr. Burns," I said.&nbsp; I looked

<BR>upon him at that moment as a model of self-

<BR>possession.&nbsp; I even conceived on that account a

<BR>sort of admiration for that man, who had (apart

<BR>from the intense materiality of what was left of his

<BR>beard) come as near to being a disembodied spirit

<BR>as any man can do and live.&nbsp; I noticed the pre-

<BR>ternatural sharpness of the ridge of his nose, the

<BR>deep cavities of his temples, and I envied him.&nbsp; He

<BR>was so reduced that he would probably die very

<BR>soon.&nbsp; Enviable man!&nbsp; So near extinction--while

<BR>I had to bear within me a tumult of suffering

<BR>vitality, doubt, confusion, self-reproach, and an in-

<BR>definite reluctance to meet the horrid logic of the

<BR>situation.&nbsp; I could not help muttering: "I feel as

<BR>if I were going mad myself."



<P>Mr. Burns glared spectrally, but otherwise

<BR>wonderfully composed.



<P>"I always thought he would play us some deadly trick,"

<BR>he said, with a peculiar emphasis on the HE.



<P>It gave me a mental shock, but I had neither the

<BR>mind, nor the heart, nor the spirit to argue with

<BR>him.&nbsp; My form of sickness was indifference.&nbsp; The

<BR>creeping paralysis of a hopeless outlook.&nbsp; So I

<BR>only gazed at him.&nbsp; Mr. Burns broke into further

<BR>speech.



<P>"Eh!&nbsp; What!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; You won't believe it?&nbsp; Well,

<BR>how do you account for this?&nbsp; How do you think it

<BR>could have happened?"



<P>"Happened?" I repeated dully.&nbsp; "Why, yes,

<BR>how in the name of the infernal powers did this

<BR>thing happen?"



<P>Indeed, on thinking it out, it seemed incompre-

<BR>hensible that it should just be like this: the bottles

<BR>emptied, refilled, rewrapped, and replaced.&nbsp; A sort

<BR>of plot, a sinister attempt to deceive, a thing re-

<BR>sembling sly vengeance, but for what?&nbsp; Or else a

<BR>fiendish joke.&nbsp; But Mr. Burns was in possession of

<BR>a theory.&nbsp; It was simple, and he uttered it solemnly

<BR>in a hollow voice.



<P>"I suppose they have given him about fifteen

<BR>pounds in Haiphong for that little lot."



<P>"Mr. Burns!" I cried.



<P>He nodded grotesquely over his raised legs, like

<BR>two broomsticks in the pyjamas, with enormous

<BR>bare feet at the end.



<P>"Why not?&nbsp; The stuff is pretty expensive in this

<BR>part of the world, and they were very short of it in

<BR>Tonkin.&nbsp; And what did he care?&nbsp; You have not

<BR>known him.&nbsp; I have, and I have defied him.&nbsp; He

<BR>feared neither God, nor devil, nor man, nor wind,

<BR>nor sea, nor his own conscience.&nbsp; And I believe he

<BR>hated everybody and everything.&nbsp; But I think he

<BR>was afraid to die.&nbsp; I believe I am the only man

<BR>who ever stood up to him.&nbsp; I faced him in that

<BR>cabin where you live now, when he was sick, and I

<BR>cowed him then.&nbsp; He thought I was going to twist

<BR>his neck for him.&nbsp; If he had had his way we would

<BR>have been beating up against the Nord-East mon-

<BR>soon, as long as he lived and afterward, too, for ages

<BR>and ages.&nbsp; Acting the Flying Dutchman in the

<BR>China Sea!&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Ha!"



<P>"But why should he replace the bottles like

<BR>this?" . . . I began.



<P>"Why shouldn't he?&nbsp; Why should he want to

<BR>throw the bottles away?&nbsp; They fit the drawer.

<BR>They belong to the medicine chest."



<P>"And they were wrapped up," I cried.



<P>"Well, the wrappers were there.&nbsp; Did it from

<BR>habit, I suppose, and as to refilling, there is always

<BR>a lot of stuff they send in paper parcels that burst

<BR>after a time.&nbsp; And then, who can tell?&nbsp; I suppose

<BR>you didn't taste it, sir?&nbsp; But, of course, you are

<BR>sure. . . ."



<P>"No," I said.&nbsp; "I didn't taste it.&nbsp; It is all over-

<BR>board now."



<P>Behind me, a soft, cultivated voice said: "I have

<BR>tasted it.&nbsp; It seemed a mixture of all sorts, sweet-

<BR>ish, saltish, very horrible."



<P>Ransome, stepping out of the pantry, had been

<BR>listening for some time, as it was very excusable

<BR>in him to do.



<P>"A dirty trick," said Mr. Burns.&nbsp; "I always

<BR>said he would."



<P>The magnitude of my indignation was un-

<BR>bounded.&nbsp; And the kind, sympathetic doctor, too.

<BR>The only sympathetic man I ever knew . . .

<BR>instead of writing that warning letter, the very re-

<BR>finement of sympathy, why didn't the man make a

<BR>proper inspection?&nbsp; But, as a matter of fact, it was

<BR>hardly fair to blame the doctor.&nbsp; The fittings were

<BR>in order and the medicine chest is an officially ar-

<BR>ranged affair.&nbsp; There was nothing really to arouse

<BR>the slightest suspicion.&nbsp; The person I could never

<BR>forgive was myself.&nbsp; Nothing should ever be taken

<BR>for granted.&nbsp; The seed of everlasting remorse was

<BR>sown in my breast.



<P>"I feel it's all my fault," I exclaimed, "mine and

<BR>nobody else's.&nbsp; That's how I feel.&nbsp; I shall never

<BR>forgive myself."



<P>"That's very foolish, sir," said Mr. Burns fiercely.



<P>And after this effort he fell back exhausted on

<BR>his bed.&nbsp; He closed his eyes, he panted; this affair,

<BR>this abominable surprise had shaken him up, too.

<BR>As I turned away I perceived Ransome looking at

<BR>me blankly.&nbsp; He appreciated what it meant, but

<BR>managed to produce his pleasant, wistful smile.

<BR>Then he stepped back into his pantry, and I rushed

<BR>up on deck again to see whether there was any

<BR>wind, any breath under the sky, any stir of the air,

<BR>any sign of hope.&nbsp; The deadly stillness met me

<BR>again.&nbsp; Nothing was changed except that there

<BR>was a different man at the wheel.&nbsp; He looked ill.

<BR>His whole figure drooped, and he seemed rather to

<BR>cling to the spokes than hold them with a controll-

<BR>ing grip.&nbsp; I said to him:



<P>"You are not fit to be here."



<P>"I can manage, sir," he said feebly.



<P>As a matter of fact, there was nothing for him to do.

<BR>The ship had no steerage way.&nbsp; She lay with her

<BR>head to the westward, the everlasting Koh-ring

<BR>visible over the stern, with a few small islets, black

<BR>spots in the great blaze, swimming before my

<BR>troubled eyes.&nbsp; And but for those bits of land there

<BR>was no speck on the sky, no speck on the water, no

<BR>shape of vapour, no wisp of smoke, no sail, no boat,

<BR>no stir of humanity, no sign of life, nothing!



<P>The first question was, what to do?&nbsp; What could

<BR>one do?&nbsp; The first thing to do obviously was to tell

<BR>the men.&nbsp; I did it that very day.&nbsp; I wasn't going

<BR>to let the knowledge simply get about.&nbsp; I would

<BR>face them.&nbsp; They were assembled on the quarter-

<BR>deck for the purpose.&nbsp; Just before I stepped out to

<BR>speak to them I discovered that life could hold

<BR>terrible moments.&nbsp; No confessed criminal had ever

<BR>been so oppressed by his sense of guilt.&nbsp; This is

<BR>why, perhaps, my face was set hard and my voice

<BR>curt and unemotional while I made my declaration

<BR>that I could do nothing more for the sick in the way

<BR>of drugs.&nbsp; As to such care as could be given them

<BR>they knew they had had it.



<P>I would have held them justified in tearing me

<BR>limb from limb.&nbsp; The silence which followed upon

<BR>my words was almost harder to bear than the

<BR>angriest uproar.&nbsp; I was crushed by the infinite

<BR>depth of its reproach.&nbsp; But, as a matter of fact, I

<BR>was mistaken.&nbsp; In a voice which I had great diffi-

<BR>culty in keeping firm, I went on: "I suppose, men,

<BR>you have understood what I said, and you know

<BR>what it means."



<P>A voice or two were heard: "Yes, sir. . . .&nbsp; We

<BR>understand."



<P>They had kept silent simply because they

<BR>thought that they were not called to say anything;

<BR>and when I told them that I intended to run into

<BR>Singapore and that the best chance for the ship

<BR>and the men was in the efforts all of us, sick and

<BR>well, must make to get her along out of this, I re-

<BR>ceived the encouragement of a low assenting mur-

<BR>mur and of a louder voice exclaiming: "Surely

<BR>there is a way out of this blamed hole."

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>***

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here is an extract from the notes I wrote at the time.



<P>"We have lost Koh-ring at last.&nbsp; For many days

<BR>now I don't think I have been two hours below al-

<BR>together.&nbsp; I remain on deck, of course, night and

<BR>day, and the nights and the days wheel over us in

<BR>succession, whether long or short, who can say?

<BR>All sense of time is lost in the monotony of ex-

<BR>pectation, of hope, and of desire--which is only

<BR>one: Get the ship to the southward!&nbsp; Get the ship

<BR>to the southward!&nbsp; The effect is curiously me-

<BR>chanical; the sun climbs and descends, the night

<BR>swings over our heads as if somebody below the

<BR>horizon were turning a crank.&nbsp; It is the prettiest,

<BR>the most aimless! . . . and all through that

<BR>miserable performance I go on, tramping, tramp-

<BR>ing the deck.&nbsp; How many miles have I walked on

<BR>the poop of that ship!&nbsp; A stubborn pilgrimage of

<BR>sheer restlessness, diversified by short excursions

<BR>below to look upon Mr. Burns.&nbsp; I don't know

<BR>whether it is an illusion, but he seems to become

<BR>more substantial from day to day.&nbsp; He doesn't say

<BR>much, for, indeed, the situation doesn't lend itself

<BR>to idle remarks.&nbsp; I notice this even with the men as

<BR>I watch them moving or sitting about the decks.

<BR>They don't talk to each other.&nbsp; It strikes me that

<BR>if there exists an invisible ear catching the whispers

<BR>of the earth, it will find this ship the most silent

<BR>spot on it. . . .



<P>"No, Mr. Burns has not much to say to me.&nbsp; He

<BR>sits in his bunk with his beard gone, his moustaches

<BR>flaming, and with an air of silent determination on

<BR>his chalky physiognomy.&nbsp; Ransome tells me he

<BR>devours all the food that is given him to the last

<BR>scrap, but that, apparently, he sleeps very little.

<BR>Even at night, when I go below to fill my pipe, I

<BR>notice that, though dozing flat on his back, he

<BR>still looks very determined.&nbsp; From the side glance

<BR>he gives me when awake it seems as though he were

<BR>annoyed at being interrupted in some arduous

<BR>mental operation; and as I emerge on deck the

<BR>ordered arrangement of the stars meets my eye, un-

<BR>clouded, infinitely wearisome.&nbsp; There they are:

<BR>stars, sun, sea, light, darkness, space, great waters;

<BR>the formidable Work of the Seven Days, into which

<BR>mankind seems to have blundered unbidden.&nbsp; Or

<BR>else decoyed.&nbsp; Even as I have been decoyed into

<BR>this awful, this death-haunted command. . . ."

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>***

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The only spot of light in the ship at night was

<BR>that of the compass-lamps, lighting up the faces of

<BR>the succeeding helmsmen; for the rest we were lost

<BR>in the darkness, I walking the poop and the men

<BR>lying about the decks.&nbsp; They were all so reduced

<BR>by sickness that no watches could be kept.&nbsp; Those

<BR>who were able to walk remained all the time on

<BR>duty, lying about in the shadows of the main deck,

<BR>till my voice raised for an order would bring them

<BR>to their enfeebled feet, a tottering little group, mov-

<BR>ing patently about the ship, with hardly a mur-

<BR>mur, a whisper amongst them all.&nbsp; And every

<BR>time I had to raise my voice it was with a pang of

<BR>remorse and pity.



<P>Then about four o'clock in the morning a light

<BR>would gleam forward in the galley.&nbsp; The unfailing

<BR>Ransome with the uneasy heart, immune, serene,

<BR>and active, was getting ready for the early coffee for

<BR>the men.&nbsp; Presently he would bring me a cup up

<BR>on the poop, and it was then that I allowed myself

<BR>to drop into my deck chair for a couple of hours of

<BR>real sleep.&nbsp; No doubt I must have been snatching

<BR>short dozes when leaning against the rail for a mo-

<BR>ment in sheer exhaustion; but, honestly, I was not

<BR>aware of them, except in the painful form of con-

<BR>vulsive starts that seemed to come on me even

<BR>while I walked.&nbsp; From about five, however, until

<BR>after seven I would sleep openly under the fading

<BR>stars.



<P>I would say to the helmsman: "Call me at

<BR>need," and drop into that chair and close my eyes,

<BR>feeling that there was no more sleep for me on

<BR>earth.&nbsp; And then I would know nothing till, some

<BR>time between seven and eight, I would feel a touch

<BR>on my shoulder and look up at Ransome's face,

<BR>with its faint, wistful smile and friendly, gray

<BR>eyes, as though he were tenderly amused at my

<BR>slumbers.&nbsp; Occasionally the second mate would

<BR>come up and relieve me at early coffee time.&nbsp; But

<BR>it didn't really matter.&nbsp; Generally it was a dead

<BR>calm, or else faint airs so changing and fugitive

<BR>that it really wasn't worth while to touch a brace

<BR>for them.&nbsp; If the air steadied at all the seaman at

<BR>the helm could be trusted for a warning shout:

<BR>"Ship's all aback, sir!" which like a trumpet-

<BR>call would make me spring a foot above the deck.

<BR>Those were the words which it seemed to me would

<BR>have made me spring up from eternal sleep.&nbsp; But

<BR>this was not often.&nbsp; I have never met since such

<BR>breathless sunrises.&nbsp; And if the second mate hap-

<BR>pened to be there (he had generally one day in

<BR>three free of fever) I would find him sitting on the

<BR>skylight half senseless, as it were, and with an

<BR>idiotic gaze fastened on some object near by--a

<BR>rope, a cleat, a belaying pin, a ringbolt.



<P>That young man was rather troublesome.&nbsp; He

<BR>remained cubbish in his sufferings.&nbsp; He seemed to

<BR>have become completely imbecile; and when the re-

<BR>turn of fever drove him to his cabin below, the next

<BR>thing would be that we would miss him from there.

<BR>The first time it happened Ransome and I were

<BR>very much alarmed.&nbsp; We started a quiet search

<BR>and ultimately Ransome discovered him curled up

<BR>in the sail-locker, which opened into the lobby by a

<BR>sliding door.&nbsp; When remonstrated with, he mut-

<BR>tered sulkily, "It's cool in there."&nbsp; That wasn't

<BR>true.&nbsp; It was only dark there.



<P>The fundamental defects of his face were not im-

<BR>proved by its uniform livid hue.&nbsp; The disease dis-

<BR>closed its low type in a startling way.&nbsp; It was not

<BR>so with many of the men.&nbsp; The wastage of ill-

<BR>health seemed to idealise the general character of

<BR>the features, bringing out the unsuspected nobility

<BR>of some, the strength of others, and in one case re-

<BR>vealing an essentially comic aspect.&nbsp; He was a

<BR>short, gingery, active man with a nose and chin of

<BR>the Punch type, and whom his shipmates called

<BR>"Frenchy."&nbsp; I don't know why.&nbsp; He may have

<BR>been a Frenchman, but I have never heard him

<BR>utter a single word in French.



<P>To see him coming aft to the wheel comforted

<BR>one.&nbsp; The blue dungaree trousers turned up the

<BR>calf, one leg a little higher than the other, the clean

<BR>check shirt, the white canvas cap, evidently made

<BR>by himself, made up a whole of peculiar smartness,

<BR>and the persistent jauntiness of his gait, even, poor

<BR>fellow, when he couldn't help tottering, told of his

<BR>invincible spirit.&nbsp; There was also a man called

<BR>Gambril.&nbsp; He was the only grizzled person in the

<BR>ship.&nbsp; His face was of an austere type.&nbsp; But if I re-

<BR>member all their faces, wasting tragically before my

<BR>eyes, most of their names have vanished from my

<BR>memory.



<P>The words that passed between us were few and

<BR>puerile in regard of the situation.&nbsp; I had to force

<BR>myself to look them in the face.&nbsp; I expected to

<BR>meet reproachful glances.&nbsp; There were none.&nbsp; The

<BR>expression of suffering in their eyes was indeed

<BR>hard enough to bear.&nbsp; But that they couldn't help.

<BR>For the rest, I ask myself whether it was the temper

<BR>of their souls or the sympathy of their imagination

<BR>that made them so wonderful, so worthy of my un-

<BR>dying regard.



<P>For myself, neither my soul was highly tempered,

<BR>nor my imagination properly under control.&nbsp; There

<BR>were moments when I felt, not only that I would go

<BR>mad, but that I had gone mad already; so that I

<BR>dared not open my lips for fear of betraying myself

<BR>by some insane shriek.&nbsp; Luckily I had only orders

<BR>to give, and an order has a steadying influence upon

<BR>him who has to give it.&nbsp; Moreover, the seaman,

<BR>the officer of the watch, in me was sufficiently sane.

<BR>I was like a mad carpenter making a box.

<BR>Were he ever so convinced that he was King of

<BR>Jerusalem, the box he would make would be a sane

<BR>box.&nbsp; What I feared was a shrill note escaping me

<BR>involuntarily and upsetting my balance.&nbsp; Luckily,

<BR>again, there was no necessity to raise one's voice.

<BR>The brooding stillness of the world seemed sensitive

<BR>to the slightest sound, like a whispering gallery.

<BR>The conversational tone would almost carry a

<BR>word from one end of the ship to the other.&nbsp; The

<BR>terrible thing was that the only voice that I ever

<BR>heard was my own.&nbsp; At night especially it reverber-

<BR>ated very lonely amongst the planes of the un-

<BR>stirring sails.



<P>Mr. Burns, still keeping to his bed with that air

<BR>of secret determination, was moved to grumble at

<BR>many things.&nbsp; Our interviews were short five-

<BR>minute affairs, but fairly frequent.&nbsp; I was everlast-

<BR>ingly diving down below to get a light, though I did

<BR>not consume much tobacco at that time.&nbsp; The pipe

<BR>was always going out; for in truth my mind was not

<BR>composed enough to enable me to get a decent

<BR>smoke.&nbsp; Likewise, for most of the time during the

<BR>twenty-four hours I could have struck matches on

<BR>deck and held them aloft till the flame burnt my

<BR>fingers.&nbsp; But I always used to run below.&nbsp; It was

<BR>a change.&nbsp; It was the only break in the incessant

<BR>strain; and, of course, Mr. Burns through the open

<BR>door could see me come in and go out every time.



<P>With his knees gathered up under his chin and

<BR>staring with his greenish eyes over them, he was a

<BR>weird figure, and with my knowledge of the crazy

<BR>notion in his head, not a very attractive one for me.

<BR>Still, I had to speak to him now and then, and one

<BR>day he complained that the ship was very silent.

<BR>For hours and hours, he said, he was lying there, not

<BR>hearing a sound, till he did not know what to do

<BR>with himself.



<P>"When Ransome happens to be forward in his

<BR>galley everything's so still that one might think

<BR>everybody in the ship was dead," he grumbled.

<BR>"The only voice I do hear sometimes is yours, sir,

<BR>and that isn't enough to cheer me up.&nbsp; What's the

<BR>matter with the men?&nbsp; Isn't there one left that can

<BR>sing out at the ropes?"



<P>"Not one, Mr. Burns," I said.&nbsp; "There is no

<BR>breath to spare on board this ship for that.&nbsp; Are

<BR>you aware that there are times when I can't muster

<BR>more than three hands to do anything?"



<P>He asked swiftly but fearfully:



<P>"Nobody dead yet, sir?"



<P>"No."



<P>"It wouldn't do," Mr. Burns declared forcibly.

<BR>"Mustn't let him.&nbsp; If he gets hold of one he will

<BR>get them all."



<P>I cried out angrily at this.&nbsp; I believe I even

<BR>swore at the disturbing effect of these words.

<BR>They attacked all the self-possession that was left

<BR>to me.&nbsp; In my endless vigil in the face of the enemy

<BR>I had been haunted by gruesome images enough.&nbsp; I

<BR>had had visions of a ship drifting in calms and

<BR>swinging in light airs, with all her crew dying slowly

<BR>about her decks.&nbsp; Such things had been known to

<BR>happen.



<P>Mr. Burns met my outburst by a mysterious

<BR>silence.



<P>"Look here," I said.&nbsp; "You don't believe your-

<BR>self what you say.&nbsp; You can't.&nbsp; It's impossible.

<BR>It isn't the sort of thing I have a right to expect

<BR>from you.&nbsp; My position's bad enough without

<BR>being worried with your silly fancies."



<P>He remained unmoved.&nbsp; On account of the way

<BR>in which the light fell on his head I could not be

<BR>sure whether he had smiled faintly or not.&nbsp; I

<BR>changed my tone.



<P>"Listen," I said.&nbsp; "It's getting so desperate

<BR>that I had thought for a moment, since we can't

<BR>make our way south, whether I wouldn't try to

<BR>steer west and make an attempt to reach the mail-

<BR>boat track.&nbsp; We could always get some quinine

<BR>from her, at least.&nbsp; What do you think?"



<P>He cried out: "No, no, no.&nbsp; Don't do that, sir.

<BR>You mustn't for a moment give up facing that old

<BR>ruffian.&nbsp; If you do he will get the upper hand of

<BR>us."



<P>I left him.&nbsp; He was impossible.&nbsp; It was like a

<BR>case of possession.&nbsp; His protest, however, was

<BR>essentially quite sound.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, my

<BR>notion of heading out west on the chance of sight-

<BR>ing a problematical steamer could not bear calm

<BR>examination.&nbsp; On the side where we were we had

<BR>enough wind, at least from time to time, to struggle

<BR>on toward the south.&nbsp; Enough, at least, to keep

<BR>hope alive.&nbsp; But suppose that I had used those

<BR>capricious gusts of wind to sail away to the west-

<BR>ward, into some region where there was not a

<BR>breath of air for days on end, what then?&nbsp; Perhaps

<BR>my appalling vision of a ship floating with a dead

<BR>crew would become a reality for the discovery

<BR>weeks afterward by some horror-stricken mariners.



<P>That afternoon Ransome brought me up a cup

<BR>of tea, and while waiting there, tray in hand, he re-

<BR>marked in the exactly right tone of sympathy:



<P>"You are holding out well, sir."



<P>"Yes," I said.&nbsp; "You and I seem to have been

<BR>forgotten."



<P>"Forgotten, sir?"



<P>"Yes, by the fever-devil who has got on board

<BR>this ship," I said.



<P>Ransome gave me one of his attractive, intelli-

<BR>gent, quick glances and went away with the tray.

<BR>It occurred to me that I had been talking some-

<BR>what in Mr. Burns' manner.&nbsp; It annoyed me.&nbsp; Yet

<BR>often in darker moments I forgot myself into an

<BR>attitude toward our troubles more fit for a contest

<BR>against a living enemy.



<P>Yes.&nbsp; The fever-devil had not laid his hand yet

<BR>either on Ransome or on me.&nbsp; But he might at any

<BR>time.&nbsp; It was one of those thoughts one had to

<BR>fight down, keep at arm's length at any cost.&nbsp; It

<BR>was unbearable to contemplate the possibility of

<BR>Ransome, the housekeeper of the ship, being laid

<BR>low.&nbsp; And what would happen to my command if

<BR>I got knocked over, with Mr. Burns too weak to

<BR>stand without holding on to his bed-place and the

<BR>second mate reduced to a state of permanent im-

<BR>becility?&nbsp; It was impossible to imagine, or rather,

<BR>it was only too easy to imagine.



<P>I was alone on the poop.&nbsp; The ship having no

<BR>steerage way, I had sent the helmsman away to sit

<BR>down or lie down somewhere in the shade.&nbsp; The

<BR>men's strength was so reduced that all unnecessary

<BR>calls on it had to be avoided.&nbsp; It was the austere

<BR>Gambril with the grizzly beard.&nbsp; He went away

<BR>readily enough, but he was so weakened by re-

<BR>peated bouts of fever, poor fellow, that in order to

<BR>get down the poop ladder he had to turn sideways

<BR>and hang on with both hands to the brass rail.&nbsp; It

<BR>was just simply heart-breaking to watch.&nbsp; Yet he

<BR>was neither very much worse nor much better than

<BR>most of the half-dozen miserable victims I could

<BR>muster up on deck.



<P>It was a terribly lifeless afternoon.&nbsp; For several

<BR>days in succession low clouds had appeared in the

<BR>distance, white masses with dark convolutions rest-

<BR>ing on the water, motionless, almost solid, and yet

<BR>all the time changing their aspects subtly.&nbsp; To-

<BR>ward evening they vanished as a rule.&nbsp; But this

<BR>day they awaited the setting sun, which glowed and

<BR>smouldered sulkily amongst them before it sank

<BR>down.&nbsp; The punctual and wearisome stars re-

<BR>appeared over our mastheads, but the air remained

<BR>stagnant and oppressive.



<P>The unfailing Ransome lighted the binnacle-

<BR>lamps and glided, all shadowy, up to me.



<P>"Will you go down and try to eat something,

<BR>sir?" he suggested.



<P>His low voice startled me.&nbsp; I had been standing

<BR>looking out over the rail, saying nothing, feeling

<BR>nothing, not even the weariness of my limbs, over-

<BR>come by the evil spell.



<P>"Ransome," I asked abruptly, "how long have I

<BR>been on deck?&nbsp; I am losing the notion of time."



<P>"Twelve days, sir," he said, "and it's just a

<BR>fortnight since we left the anchorage."



<P>His equable voice sounded mournful somehow.

<BR>He waited a bit, then added: "It's the first time

<BR>that it looks as if we were to have some rain."



<P>I noticed then the broad shadow on the horizon,

<BR>extinguishing the low stars completely, while those

<BR>overhead, when I looked up, seemed to shine down

<BR>on us through a veil of smoke.



<P>How it got there, how it had crept up so high, I

<BR>couldn't say.&nbsp; It had an ominous appearance.&nbsp; The

<BR>air did not stir.&nbsp; At a renewed invitation from

<BR>Ransome I did go down into the cabin to--in his

<BR>own words--"try and eat something."&nbsp; I don't

<BR>know that the trial was very successful.&nbsp; I sup-

<BR>pose at that period I did exist on food in the usual

<BR>way; but the memory is now that in those days life

<BR>was sustained on invincible anguish, as a sort of

<BR>infernal stimulant exciting and consuming at the

<BR>same time.



<P>It's the only period of my life in which I at-

<BR>tempted to keep a diary.&nbsp; No, not the only one.

<BR>Years later, in conditions of moral isolation, I did

<BR>put down on paper the thoughts and events of a

<BR>score of days.&nbsp; But this was the first time.&nbsp; I don't

<BR>remember how it came about or how the pocket-

<BR>book and the pencil came into my hands.&nbsp; It's in-

<BR>conceivable that I should have looked for them on

<BR>purpose.&nbsp; I suppose they saved me from the crazy

<BR>trick of talking to myself.



<P>Strangely enough, in both cases I took to that

<BR>sort of thing in circumstances in which I did not ex-

<BR>pect, in colloquial phrase, "to come out of it."

<BR>Neither could I expect the record to outlast me.

<BR>This shows that it was purely a personal need for

<BR>intimate relief and not a call of egotism.



<P>Here I must give another sample of it, a few de-

<BR>tached lines, now looking very ghostly to my own

<BR>eyes, out of the part scribbled that very evening:

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>***

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is something going on in the sky like

<BR>a decomposition; like a corruption of the air,

<BR>which remains as still as ever.&nbsp; After all, mere

<BR>clouds, which may or may not hold wind or rain.

<BR>Strange that it should trouble me so.&nbsp; I feel as if all

<BR>my sins had found me out.&nbsp; But I suppose the

<BR>trouble is that the ship is still lying motionless, not

<BR>under command; and that I have nothing to do to

<BR>keep my imagination from running wild amongst

<BR>the disastrous images of the worst that may befall

<BR>us.&nbsp; What's going to happen?&nbsp; Probably nothing.

<BR>Or anything.&nbsp; It may be a furious squall coming,

<BR>butt end foremost.&nbsp; And on deck there are five

<BR>men with the vitality and the strength, of say, two.

<BR>We may have all our sails blown away.&nbsp; Every

<BR>stitch of canvas has been on her since we broke

<BR>ground at the mouth of the Mei-nam, fifteen days

<BR>ago . . . or fifteen centuries.&nbsp; It seems to me

<BR>that all my life before that momentous day is in-

<BR>finitely remote, a fading memory of light-hearted

<BR>youth, something on the other side of a shadow.

<BR>Yes, sails may very well be blown away.&nbsp; And that

<BR>would be like a death sentence on the men.&nbsp; We

<BR>haven't strength enough on board to bend another

<BR>suit; incredible thought, but it is true.&nbsp; Or we may

<BR>even get dismasted.&nbsp; Ships have been dismasted in

<BR>squalls simply because they weren't handled quick

<BR>enough, and we have no power to whirl the yards

<BR>around.&nbsp; It's like being bound hand and foot pre-

<BR>paratory to having one's throat cut.&nbsp; And what

<BR>appals me most of all is that I shrink from going on

<BR>deck to face it.&nbsp; It's due to the ship, it's due to the

<BR>men who are there on deck--some of them, ready

<BR>to put out the last remnant of their strength at a

<BR>word from me.&nbsp; And I am shrinking from it.&nbsp; From

<BR>the mere vision.&nbsp; My first command.&nbsp; Now I

<BR>understand that strange sense of insecurity in my

<BR>past.&nbsp; I always suspected that I might be no good.

<BR>And here is proof positive.&nbsp; I am shirking it.&nbsp; I

<BR>am no good."

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>***

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At that moment, or, perhaps, the moment after,

<BR>I became aware of Ransome standing in the cabin.

<BR>Something in his expression startled me.&nbsp; It had a

<BR>meaning which I could not make out.&nbsp; I exclaimed:

<BR>"Somebody's dead."



<P>It was his turn then to look startled.



<P>"Dead?&nbsp; Not that I know of, sir.&nbsp; I have been in

<BR>the forecastle only ten minutes ago and there was

<BR>no dead man there then."



<P>"You did give me a scare," I said.



<P>His voice was extremely pleasant to listen to.

<BR>He explained that he had come down below to close

<BR>Mr. Burns' port in case it should come on to rain.

<BR>"He did not know that I was in the cabin," he added.



<P>"How does it look outside?" I asked him.



<P>"Very black, indeed, sir.&nbsp; There is something in

<BR>it for certain."



<P>"In what quarter?"



<P>"All round, sir."



<P>I repeated idly: "All round.&nbsp; For certain," with

<BR>my elbows on the table.



<P>Ransome lingered in the cabin as if he had some-

<BR>thing to do there, but hesitated about doing it.&nbsp; I

<BR>said suddenly:



<P>"You think I ought to be on deck?"



<P>He answered at once but without any particular

<BR>emphasis or accent: "I do, sir."



<P>I got to my feet briskly, and he made way for me

<BR>to go out.&nbsp; As I passed through the lobby I heard

<BR>Mr. Burns' voice saying:



<P>"Shut the door of my room, will you, steward?"

<BR>And Ransome's rather surprised: "Certainly, sir."



<P>I thought that all my feelings had been dulled

<BR>into complete indifference.&nbsp; But I found it as try-

<BR>ing as ever to be on deck.&nbsp; The impenetrable black-

<BR>ness beset the ship so close that it seemed that by

<BR>thrusting one's hand over the side one could touch

<BR>some unearthly substance.&nbsp; There was in it an

<BR>effect of inconceivable terror and of inexpressible

<BR>mystery.&nbsp; The few stars overhead shed a dim light

<BR>upon the ship alone, with no gleams of any kind

<BR>upon the water, in detached shafts piercing an at-

<BR>mosphere which had turned to soot.&nbsp; It was some-

<BR>thing I had never seen before, giving no hint of the

<BR>direction from which any change would come, the

<BR>closing in of a menace from all sides.



<P>There was still no man at the helm.&nbsp; The im-

<BR>mobility of all things was perfect.&nbsp; If the air had

<BR>turned black, the sea, for all I knew, might have

<BR>turned solid.&nbsp; It was no good looking in any di-

<BR>rection, watching for any sign, speculating upon

<BR>the nearness of the moment.&nbsp; When the time came

<BR>the blackness would overwhelm silently the bit of

<BR>starlight falling upon the ship, and the end of all

<BR>things would come without a sigh, stir, or murmur

<BR>of any kind, and all our hearts would cease to beat

<BR>like run-down clocks.



<P>It was impossible to shake off that sense of

<BR>finality.&nbsp; The quietness that came over me was

<BR>like a foretaste of annihilation.&nbsp; It gave me a sort

<BR>of comfort, as though my soul had become suddenly

<BR>reconciled to an eternity of blind stillness.



<P>The seaman's instinct alone survived whole in

<BR>my moral dissolution.&nbsp; I descended the ladder to

<BR>the quarter-deck.&nbsp; The starlight seemed to die out

<BR>before reaching that spot, but when I asked

<BR>quietly: "Are you there, men?" my eyes made out

<BR>shadow forms starting up around me, very few,

<BR>very indistinct; and a voice spoke: "All here, sir."

<BR>Another amended anxiously:



<P>"All that are any good for anything, sir."



<P>Both voices were very quiet and unringing; with-

<BR>out any special character of readiness or discour-

<BR>agement.&nbsp; Very matter-of-fact voices.



<P>"We must try to haul this mainsail close up," I said.



<P>The shadows swayed away from me without a

<BR>word.&nbsp; Those men were the ghosts of themselves,

<BR>and their weight on a rope could be no more than

<BR>the weight of a bunch of ghosts.&nbsp; Indeed, if ever a

<BR>sail was hauled up by sheer spiritual strength it

<BR>must have been that sail, for, properly speaking,

<BR>there was not muscle enough for the task in the

<BR>whole ship let alone the miserable lot of us on deck.

<BR>Of course, I took the lead in the work myself.

<BR>They wandered feebly after me from rope to rope,

<BR>stumbling and panting.&nbsp; They toiled like Titans.

<BR>We were half-an-hour at it at least, and all the time

<BR>the black universe made no sound.&nbsp; When the last

<BR>leech-line was made fast, my eyes, accustomed to

<BR>the darkness, made out the shapes of exhausted

<BR>men drooping over the rails, collapsed on hatches.

<BR>One hung over the after-capstan, sobbing for

<BR>breath, and I stood amongst them like a tower of

<BR>strength, impervious to disease and feeling only the

<BR>sickness of my soul.&nbsp; I waited for some time fight-

<BR>ing against the weight of my sins, against my sense

<BR>of unworthiness, and then I said:



<P>"Now, men, we'll go aft and square the mainyard.

<BR>That's about all we can do for the ship; and for the

<BR>rest she must take her chance."

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>AS WE all went up it occurred to me that there

<BR>ought to be a man at the helm.&nbsp; I raised my voice

<BR>not much above a whisper, and, noiselessly, an un-

<BR>complaining spirit in a fever-wasted body appeared

<BR>in the light aft, the head with hollow eyes illumi-

<BR>nated against the blackness which had swallowed

<BR>up our world--and the universe.&nbsp; The bared fore-

<BR>arm extended over the upper spokes seemed to

<BR>shine with a light of its own.



<P>I murmured to that luminous appearance:



<P>"Keep the helm right amidships."



<P>It answered in a tone of patient suffering:



<P>"Right amidships, sir."



<P>Then I descended to the quarter-deck.&nbsp; It was

<BR>impossible to tell whence the blow would come.&nbsp; To

<BR>look round the ship was to look into a bottomless,

<BR>black pit.&nbsp; The eye lost itself in inconceivable

<BR>depths.



<P>I wanted to ascertain whether the ropes had been

<BR>picked up off the deck.&nbsp; One could only do that by

<BR>feeling with one's feet.&nbsp; In my cautious progress I

<BR>came against a man in whom I recognized

<BR>Ransome.&nbsp; He possessed an unimpaired physical

<BR>solidity which was manifest to me at the contact.

<BR>He was leaning against the quarter-deck capstan

<BR>and kept silent.&nbsp; It was like a revelation.&nbsp; He was

<BR>the collapsed figure sobbing for breath I had no-

<BR>ticed before we went on the poop.



<P>"You have been helping with the mainsail!" I

<BR>exclaimed in a low tone.



<P>"Yes, sir," sounded his quiet voice.



<P>"Man!&nbsp; What were you thinking of?&nbsp; You

<BR>mustn't do that sort of thing."



<P>After a pause he assented: "I suppose I

<BR>mustn't."&nbsp; Then after another short silence he

<BR>added: "I am all right now," quickly, between the

<BR>tell-tale gasps.



<P>I could neither hear nor see anybody else; but

<BR>when I spoke up, answering sad murmurs filled the

<BR>quarter-deck, and its shadows seemed to shift here

<BR>and there.&nbsp; I ordered all the halyards laid down on

<BR>deck clear for running.



<P>"I'll see to that, sir," volunteered Ransome in

<BR>his natural, pleasant tone, which comforted one

<BR>and aroused one's compassion, too, somehow.



<P>That man ought to have been in his bed, resting,

<BR>and my plain duty was to send him there.&nbsp; But

<BR>perhaps he would not have obeyed me; I had not

<BR>the strength of mind to try.&nbsp; All I said was:



<P>"Go about it quietly, Ransome."



<P>Returning on the poop I approached Gambril.

<BR>His face, set with hollow shadows in the light,

<BR>looked awful, finally silenced.&nbsp; I asked him how

<BR>he felt, but hardly expected an answer.&nbsp; There-

<BR>fore, I was astonished at his comparative loquac-

<BR>ity.



<P>"Them shakes leaves me as weak as a kitten,

<BR>sir," he said, preserving finely that air of uncon-

<BR>sciousness as to anything but his business a helms-

<BR>man should never lose.&nbsp; "And before I can pick

<BR>up my strength that there hot fit comes along and

<BR>knocks me over again."



<P>He sighed.&nbsp; There was no reproach in his tone,

<BR>but the bare words were enough to give me a hor-

<BR>rible pang of self-reproach.&nbsp; It held me dumb for a

<BR>time.&nbsp; When the tormenting sensation had passed

<BR>off I asked:



<P>"Do you feel strong enough to prevent the rud-

<BR>der taking charge if she gets sternway on her?&nbsp; It

<BR>wouldn't do to get something smashed about the

<BR>steering-gear now.&nbsp; We've enough difficulties to

<BR>cope with as it is."



<P>He answered with just a shade of weariness that

<BR>he was strong enough to hang on.&nbsp; He could

<BR>promise me that she shouldn't take the wheel out

<BR>of his hands.&nbsp; More he couldn't say.



<P>At that moment Ransome appeared quite close

<BR>to me, stepping out of the darkness into visibility

<BR>suddenly, as if just created with his composed face

<BR>and pleasant voice.



<P>Every rope on deck, he said, was laid down clear

<BR>for running, as far as one could make certain

<BR>by feeling.&nbsp; It was impossible to see anything.

<BR>Frenchy had stationed himself forward.&nbsp; He said

<BR>he had a jump or two left in him yet.



<P>Here a faint smile altered for an instant the

<BR>clear, firm design of Ransome's lips.&nbsp; With his

<BR>serious clear, gray eyes, his serene temperament--

<BR>he was a priceless man altogether.&nbsp; Soul as firm

<BR>as the muscles of his body.



<P>He was the only man on board (except me, but I

<BR>had to preserve my liberty of movement) who had

<BR>a sufficiency of muscular strength to trust to.&nbsp; For

<BR>a moment I thought I had better ask him to take

<BR>the wheel.&nbsp; But the dreadful knowledge of the

<BR>enemy he had to carry about him made me hesi-

<BR>tate.&nbsp; In my ignorance of physiology it occurred

<BR>to me that he might die suddenly, from excitement,

<BR>at a critical moment.



<P>While this gruesome fear restrained the ready

<BR>words on the tip of my tongue, Ransome stepped

<BR>back two paces and vanished from my sight.



<P>At once an uneasiness possessed me, as if some

<BR>support had been withdrawn.&nbsp; I moved forward,

<BR>too, outside the circle of light, into the darkness

<BR>that stood in front of me like a wall.&nbsp; In one stride

<BR>I penetrated it.&nbsp; Such must have been the dark-

<BR>ness before creation.&nbsp; It had closed behind me.&nbsp; I

<BR>knew I was invisible to the man at the helm.

<BR>Neither could I see anything.&nbsp; He was alone, I was

<BR>alone, every man was alone where he stood.&nbsp; And

<BR>every form was gone, too, spar, sail, fittings, rails;

<BR>everything was blotted out in the dreadful smooth-

<BR>ness of that absolute night.



<P>A flash of lightning would have been a relief--I

<BR>mean physically.&nbsp; I would have prayed for it if it

<BR>hadn't been for my shrinking apprehension of the

<BR>thunder.&nbsp; In the tension of silence I was suffering

<BR>from it seemed to me that the first crash must turn

<BR>me into dust.



<P>And thunder was, most likely, what would hap-

<BR>pen next.&nbsp; Stiff all over and hardly breathing,

<BR>I waited with a horribly strained expectation.

<BR>Nothing happened.&nbsp; It was maddening, but a dull,

<BR>growing ache in the lower part of my face made me

<BR>aware that I had been grinding my teeth madly

<BR>enough, for God knows how long.



<P>It's extraordinary I should not have heard my-

<BR>self doing it; but I hadn't.&nbsp; By an effort which

<BR>absorbed all my faculties I managed to keep my

<BR>jaw still.&nbsp; It required much attention, and while

<BR>thus engaged I became bothered by curious, ir-

<BR>regular sounds of faint tapping on the deck.&nbsp; They

<BR>could be heard single, in pairs, in groups.&nbsp; While

<BR>I wondered at this mysterious devilry, I received

<BR>a slight blow under the left eye and felt an enor-

<BR>mous tear run down my cheek.&nbsp; Raindrops.

<BR>Enormous.&nbsp; Forerunners of something.

<BR>Tap.&nbsp; Tap.&nbsp; Tap. . . .



<P>I turned about, and, addressing Gambrel

<BR>earnestly, entreated him to "hang on to the wheel."

<BR>But I could hardly speak from emotion.&nbsp; The fatal

<BR>moment had come.&nbsp; I held my breath.&nbsp; The tap-

<BR>ping had stopped as unexpectedly as it had begun,

<BR>and there was a renewed moment of intolerable sus-

<BR>pense; something like an additional turn of the

<BR>racking screw.&nbsp; I don't suppose I would have ever

<BR>screamed, but I remember my conviction that

<BR>there was nothing else for it but to scream.



<P>Suddenly--how am I to convey it?&nbsp; Well, sud-

<BR>denly the darkness turned into water.&nbsp; This is the

<BR>only suitable figure.&nbsp; A heavy shower, a down-

<BR>pour, comes along, making a noise.&nbsp; You hear its

<BR>approach on the sea, in the air, too, I verily believe.

<BR>But this was different.&nbsp; With no preliminary

<BR>whisper or rustle, without a splash, and even with-

<BR>out the ghost of impact, I became instantaneously

<BR>soaked to the skin.&nbsp; Not a very difficult matter,

<BR>since I was wearing only my sleeping suit.&nbsp; My

<BR>hair got full of water in an instant, water streamed

<BR>on my skin, it filled my nose, my ears, my eyes.

<BR>In a fraction of a second I swallowed quite a lot

<BR>of it.



<P>As to Gambril, he was fairly choked.&nbsp; He

<BR>coughed pitifully, the broken cough of a sick man;

<BR>and I beheld him as one sees a fish in an aquarium

<BR>by the light of an electric bulb, an elusive, phos-

<BR>phorescent shape.&nbsp; Only he did not glide away.

<BR>But something else happened.&nbsp; Both binnacle-

<BR>lamps went out.&nbsp; I suppose the water forced itself

<BR>into them, though I wouldn't have thought that

<BR>possible, for they fitted into the cowl perfectly.



<P>The last gleam of light in the universe had gone,

<BR>pursued by a low exclamation of dismay from

<BR>Gambril.&nbsp; I groped for him and seized his arm.

<BR>How startlingly wasted it was.



<P>"Never mind," I said.&nbsp; "You don't want the

<BR>light.&nbsp; All you need to do is to keep the wind,

<BR>when it comes, at the back of your head.&nbsp; You

<BR>understand?"



<P>"Aye, aye, sir. . . .&nbsp; But I should like to have

<BR>a light," he added nervously.



<P>All that time the ship lay as steady as a rock.

<BR>The noise of the water pouring off the sails and

<BR>spars, flowing over the break of the poop, had

<BR>stopped short.&nbsp; The poop scuppers gurgled and

<BR>sobbed for a little while longer, and then perfect

<BR>silence, joined to perfect immobility, proclaimed

<BR>the yet unbroken spell of our helplessness, poised

<BR>on the edge of some violent issue, lurking in the

<BR>dark.



<P>I started forward restlessly.&nbsp; I did not need my

<BR>sight to pace the poop of my ill-starred first com-

<BR>mand with perfect assurance.&nbsp; Every square foot

<BR>of her decks was impressed indelibly on my brain,

<BR>to the very grain and knots of the planks.&nbsp; Yet, all

<BR>of a sudden, I fell clean over something, landing

<BR>full length on my hands and face.



<P>It was something big and alive.&nbsp; Not a dog--

<BR>more like a sheep, rather.&nbsp; But there were no

<BR>animals in the ship.&nbsp; How could an animal. . . .

<BR>It was an added and fantastic horror which I could

<BR>not resist.&nbsp; The hair of my head stirred even as I

<BR>picked myself up, awfully scared; not as a man is

<BR>scared while his judgment, his reason still try to

<BR>resist, but completely, boundlessly, and, as it were,

<BR>innocently scared--like a little child.



<P>I could see It--that Thing!&nbsp; The darkness, of

<BR>which so much had just turned into water, had

<BR>thinned down a little.&nbsp; There It was!&nbsp; But I did not

<BR>hit upon the notion of Mr. Burns issuing out of the

<BR>companion on all fours till he attempted to stand

<BR>up, and even then the idea of a bear crossed my

<BR>mind first.



<P>He growled like one when I seized him round the

<BR>body.&nbsp; He had buttoned himself up into an enor-

<BR>mous winter overcoat of some woolly material, the

<BR>weight of which was too much for his reduced state.

<BR>I could hardly feel the incredibly thin lath of his

<BR>body, lost within the thick stuff, but his growl had

<BR>depth and substance: Confounded dump ship with

<BR>a craven, tiptoeing crowd.&nbsp; Why couldn't they

<BR>stamp and go with a brace?&nbsp; Wasn't there one God-

<BR>forsaken lubber in the lot fit to raise a yell on a

<BR>rope?



<P>"Skulking's no good, sir," he attacked me

<BR>directly.&nbsp; "You can't slink past the old murderous

<BR>ruffian.&nbsp; It isn't the way.&nbsp; You must go for him

<BR>boldly--as I did.&nbsp; Boldness is what you want.

<BR>Show him that you don't care for any of his

<BR>damned tricks.&nbsp; Kick up a jolly old row."



<P>"Good God, Mr. Burns," I said angrily.

<BR>"What on earth are you up to?&nbsp; What do you

<BR>mean by coming up on deck in this state?"



<P>"Just that!&nbsp; Boldness.&nbsp; The only way to scare

<BR>the old bullying rascal."



<P>I pushed him, still growling, against the rail.

<BR>"Hold on to it," I said roughly.&nbsp; I did not know

<BR>what to do with him.&nbsp; I left him in a hurry, to go

<BR>to Gambril, who had called faintly that he believed

<BR>there was some wind aloft.&nbsp; Indeed, my own ears

<BR>had caught a feeble flutter of wet canvas, high up

<BR>overhead, the jingle of a slack chain sheet. . . .



<P>These were eerie, disturbing, alarming sounds in

<BR>the dead stillness of the air around me.&nbsp; All the

<BR>instances I had heard of topmasts being whipped

<BR>out of a ship while there was not wind enough on

<BR>her deck to blow out a match rushed into my

<BR>memory.



<P>"I can't see the upper sails, sir," declared

<BR>Gambril shakily.



<P>"Don't move the helm.&nbsp; You'll be all right," I

<BR>said confidently.



<P>The poor man's nerves were gone.&nbsp; Mine were

<BR>not in much better case.&nbsp; It was the moment of

<BR>breaking strain and was relieved by the abrupt

<BR>sensation of the ship moving forward as if of her-

<BR>self under my feet.&nbsp; I heard plainly the soughing

<BR>of the wind aloft, the low cracks of the upper spars

<BR>taking the strain, long before I could feel the least

<BR>draught on my face turned aft, anxious and sight-

<BR>less like the face of a blind man.



<P>Suddenly a louder-sounding note filled our ears,

<BR>the darkness started streaming against our bodies,

<BR>chilling them exceedingly.&nbsp; Both of us, Gambril

<BR>and I, shivered violently in our clinging, soaked

<BR>garments of thin cotton.&nbsp; I said to him:



<P>"You are all right now, my man.&nbsp; All you've got

<BR>to do is to keep the wind at the back of your head.

<BR>Surely you are up to that.&nbsp; A child could steer this

<BR>ship in smooth water."



<P>He muttered: "Aye!&nbsp; A healthy child."&nbsp; And I

<BR>felt ashamed of having been passed over by the

<BR>fever which had been preying on every man's

<BR>strength but mine, in order that my remorse might

<BR>be the more bitter, the feeling of unworthiness more

<BR>poignant, and the sense of responsibility heavier to

<BR>bear.



<P>The ship had gathered great way on her almost

<BR>at once on the calm water.&nbsp; I felt her slipping

<BR>through it with no other noise but a mysterious

<BR>rustle alongside.&nbsp; Otherwise, she had no motion at

<BR>all, neither lift nor roll.&nbsp; It was a disheartening

<BR>steadiness which had lasted for eighteen days

<BR>now; for never, never had we had wind enough in

<BR>that time to raise the slightest run of the sea.&nbsp; The

<BR>breeze freshened suddenly.&nbsp; I thought it was high

<BR>time to get Mr. Burns off the deck.&nbsp; He worried

<BR>me.&nbsp; I looked upon him as a lunatic who would be

<BR>very likely to start roaming over the ship and break

<BR>a limb or fall overboard.



<P>I was truly glad to find he had remained holding

<BR>on where I had left him, sensibly enough.&nbsp; He was,

<BR>however, muttering to himself ominously.



<P>This was discouraging.&nbsp; I remarked in a matter-

<BR>of-fact tone:



<P>"We have never had so much wind as this since

<BR>we left the roads."



<P>"There's some heart in it, too," he growled

<BR>judiciously.&nbsp; It was a remark of a perfectly sane

<BR>seaman.&nbsp; But he added immediately: "It was

<BR>about time I should come on deck.&nbsp; I've been

<BR>nursing my strength for this--just for this.&nbsp; Do

<BR>you see it, sir?"



<P>I said I did, and proceeded to hint that it would

<BR>be advisable for him to go below now and take a

<BR>rest.



<P>His answer was an indignant "Go below!&nbsp; Not if

<BR>I know it, sir."



<P>Very cheerful!&nbsp; He was a horrible nuisance.&nbsp; And

<BR>all at once he started to argue.&nbsp; I could feel his

<BR>crazy excitement in the dark.



<P>"You don't know how to go about it, sir.&nbsp; How

<BR>could you?&nbsp; All this whispering and tiptoeing is no

<BR>good.&nbsp; You can't hope to slink past a cunning,

<BR>wide-awake, evil brute like he was.&nbsp; You never

<BR>heard him talk.&nbsp; Enough to make your hair stand

<BR>on end.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; He wasn't mad.&nbsp; He was no

<BR>more mad than I am.&nbsp; He was just downright

<BR>wicked.&nbsp; Wicked so as to frighten most people.&nbsp; I

<BR>will tell you what he was.&nbsp; He was nothing less

<BR>than a thief and a murderer at heart.&nbsp; And do you

<BR>think he's any different now because he's dead?

<BR>Not he!&nbsp; His carcass lies a hundred fathom under,

<BR>but he's just the same . . . in latitude 8 d 20'

<BR>north."



<P>He snorted defiantly.&nbsp; I noted with weary resig-

<BR>nation that the breeze had got lighter while he

<BR>raved.&nbsp; He was at it again.



<P>"I ought to have thrown the beggar out of the

<BR>ship over the rail like a dog.&nbsp; It was only on ac-

<BR>count of the men. . . .&nbsp; Fancy having to read the

<BR>Burial Service over a brute like that! . . .&nbsp; 'Our

<BR>departed brother' . . . I could have laughed.

<BR>That was what he couldn't bear.&nbsp; I suppose I am

<BR>the only man that ever stood up to laugh at him.

<BR>When he got sick it used to scare that . . .

<BR>brother. . . .&nbsp; Brother. . . .&nbsp; Departed.

<BR>. . .&nbsp; Sooner call a shark brother."



<P>The breeze had let go so suddenly that the way

<BR>of the ship brought the wet sails heavily against the

<BR>mast.&nbsp; The spell of deadly stillness had caught

<BR>us up again.&nbsp; There seemed to be no escape.



<P>"Hallo!" exclaimed Mr. Burns in a startled

<BR>voice.&nbsp; "Calm again!"



<P>I addressed him as though he had been sane.



<P>"This is the sort of thing we've been having for

<BR>seventeen days, Mr. Burns," I said with intense

<BR>bitterness.&nbsp; "A puff, then a calm, and in a mo-

<BR>ment, you'll see, she'll be swinging on her heel with

<BR>her head away from her course to the devil some-

<BR>where."



<P>He caught at the word.&nbsp; "The old dodging

<BR>Devil," he screamed piercingly and burst into such

<BR>a loud laugh as I had never heard before.&nbsp; It was a

<BR>provoking, mocking peal, with a hair-raising,

<BR>screeching over-note of defiance.&nbsp; I stepped back,

<BR>utterly confounded.



<P>Instantly there was a stir on the quarter-deck;

<BR>murmurs of dismay.&nbsp; A distressed voice cried out

<BR>in the dark below us: "Who's that gone crazy,

<BR>now?"



<P>Perhaps they thought it was their captain?

<BR>Rush is not the word that could be applied to the

<BR>utmost speed the poor fellows were up to; but in

<BR>an amazing short time every man in the ship able

<BR>to walk upright had found his way on to that poop.



<P>I shouted to them: "It's the mate.&nbsp; Lay hold of

<BR>him a couple of you. . . ."



<P>I expected this performance to end in a ghastly

<BR>sort of fight.&nbsp; But Mr. Burns cut his derisive

<BR>screeching dead short and turned upon them

<BR>fiercely, yelling:



<P>"Aha!&nbsp; Dog-gone ye!&nbsp; You've found your

<BR>tongues--have ye?&nbsp; I thought you were dumb.

<BR>Well, then--laugh!&nbsp; Laugh--I tell you.&nbsp; Now then

<BR>--all together.&nbsp; One, two, three--laugh!"



<P>A moment of silence ensued, of silence so pro-

<BR>found that you could have heard a pin drop on the

<BR>deck.&nbsp; Then Ransome's unperturbed voice uttered

<BR>pleasantly the words:



<P>"I think he has fainted, sir--"&nbsp; The little

<BR>motionless knot of men stirred, with low murmurs

<BR>of relief.&nbsp; "I've got him under the arms.&nbsp; Get

<BR>hold of his legs, some one."



<P>Yes.&nbsp; It was a relief.&nbsp; He was silenced for a

<BR>time--for a time.&nbsp; I could not have stood another

<BR>peal of that insane screeching.&nbsp; I was sure of it;

<BR>and just then Gambril, the austere Gambril, treated

<BR>us to another vocal performance.&nbsp; He began to

<BR>sing out for relief.&nbsp; His voice wailed pitifully in

<BR>the darkness: "Come aft somebody!&nbsp; I can't

<BR>stand this.&nbsp; Here she'll be off again directly and I

<BR>can't. . . ."



<P>I dashed aft myself meeting on my way a hard

<BR>gust of wind whose approach Gambril's ear had

<BR>detected from afar and which filled the sails on the

<BR>main in a series of muffled reports mingled with the

<BR>low plaint of the spars.&nbsp; I was just in time to seize

<BR>the wheel while Frenchy who had followed me

<BR>caught up the collapsing Gambril.&nbsp; He hauled him

<BR>out of the way, admonished him to lie still where he

<BR>was, and then stepped up to relieve me, asking

<BR>calmly:



<P>"How am I to steer her, sir?"



<P>"Dead before it for the present.&nbsp; I'll get you a

<BR>light in a moment."



<P>But going forward I met Ransome bringing up

<BR>the spare binnacle lamp.&nbsp; That man noticed

<BR>everything, attended to everything, shed comfort

<BR>around him as he moved.&nbsp; As he passed me he re-

<BR>marked in a soothing tone that the stars were com-

<BR>ing out.&nbsp; They were.&nbsp; The breeze was sweeping

<BR>clear the sooty sky, breaking through the indolent

<BR>silence of the sea.



<P>The barrier of awful stillness which had encom-

<BR>passed us for so many days as though we had been

<BR>accursed, was broken.&nbsp; I felt that.&nbsp; I let myself

<BR>fall on to the skylight seat.&nbsp; A faint white ridge of

<BR>foam, thin, very thin, broke alongside.&nbsp; The first for

<BR>ages--for ages.&nbsp; I could have cheered, if it hadn't

<BR>been for the sense of guilt which clung to all

<BR>my thoughts secretly.&nbsp; Ransome stood before me.



<P>"What about the mate," I asked anxiously.

<BR>"Still unconscious?"



<P>"Well, sir--it's funny," Ransome was evidently

<BR>puzzled.&nbsp; "He hasn't spoken a word, and his eyes

<BR>are shut.&nbsp; But it looks to me more like sound sleep

<BR>than anything else."



<P>I accepted this view as the least troublesome of

<BR>any, or at any rate, least disturbing.&nbsp; Dead faint

<BR>or deep slumber, Mr. Burns had to be left to him-

<BR>self for the present.&nbsp; Ransome remarked sud-

<BR>denly:



<P>"I believe you want a coat, sir."



<P>"I believe I do," I sighed out.



<P>But I did not move.&nbsp; What I felt I wanted were

<BR>new limbs.&nbsp; My arms and legs seemed utterly use-

<BR>less, fairly worn out.&nbsp; They didn't even ache.&nbsp; But

<BR>I stood up all the same to put on the coat when

<BR>Ransome brought it up.&nbsp; And when he suggested

<BR>that he had better now "take Gambril forward," I

<BR>said:



<P>"All right.&nbsp; I'll help you to get him down on the

<BR>main deck."



<P>I found that I was quite able to help, too.&nbsp; We

<BR>raised Gambril up between us.&nbsp; He tried to help

<BR>himself along like a man but all the time he was in-

<BR>quiring piteously:



<P>"You won't let me go when we come to the lad-

<BR>der?&nbsp; You won't let me go when we come to the

<BR>ladder?"

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The breeze kept on freshening and blew true,

<BR>true to a hair.&nbsp; At daylight by careful manipula-

<BR>tion of the helm we got the foreyards to run square

<BR>by themselves (the water keeping smooth) and

<BR>then went about hauling the ropes tight.&nbsp; Of the

<BR>four men I had with me at night, I could see now

<BR>only two.&nbsp; I didn't inquire as to the others.&nbsp; They

<BR>had given in.&nbsp; For a time only I hoped.



<P>Our various tasks forward occupied us for hours,

<BR>the two men with me moved so slow and had to

<BR>rest so often.&nbsp; One of them remarked that "every

<BR>blamed thing in the ship felt about a hundred times

<BR>heavier than its proper weight."&nbsp; This was the

<BR>only complaint uttered.&nbsp; I don't know what we

<BR>should have done without Ransome.&nbsp; He worked

<BR>with us, silent, too, with a little smile frozen on his

<BR>lips.&nbsp; From time to time I murmured to him:

<BR>"Go steady"--"Take it easy, Ransome"--and re-

<BR>ceived a quick glance in reply.



<P>When we had done all we could do to make

<BR>things safe, he disappeared into his galley.&nbsp; Some

<BR>time afterward, going forward for a look round, I

<BR>caught sight of him through the open door.&nbsp; He

<BR>sat upright on the locker in front of the stove, with

<BR>his head leaning back against the bulkhead.&nbsp; His

<BR>eyes were closed; his capable hands held open the

<BR>front of his thin cotton shirt baring tragically

<BR>his powerful chest, which heaved in painful and

<BR>laboured gasps.&nbsp; He didn't hear me.



<P>I retreated quietly and went straight on to the

<BR>poop to relieve Frenchy, who by that time was be-

<BR>ginning to look very sick.&nbsp; He gave me the course

<BR>with great formality and tried to go off with a

<BR>jaunty step, but reeled widely twice before getting

<BR>out of my sight.



<P>And then I remained all alone aft, steering my

<BR>ship, which ran before the wind with a buoyant lift

<BR>now and then, and even rolling a little.&nbsp; Presently

<BR>Ransome appeared before me with a tray.&nbsp; The

<BR>sight of food made me ravenous all at once.&nbsp; He

<BR>took the wheel while I sat down of the after grating

<BR>to eat my breakfast.



<P>"This breeze seems to have done for our crowd,"

<BR>he murmured.&nbsp; "It just laid them low--all hands."



<P>"Yes," I said.&nbsp; "I suppose you and I are the

<BR>only two fit men in the ship."



<P>"Frenchy says there's still a jump left in him.&nbsp; I

<BR>don't know.&nbsp; It can't be much," continued Ran-

<BR>some with his wistful smile.&nbsp; Good little man that.

<BR>But suppose, sir, that this wind flies round when

<BR>we are close to the land--what are we going to do

<BR>with her?"



<P>"If the wind shifts round heavily after we close

<BR>in with the land she will either run ashore or get

<BR>dismasted or both.&nbsp; We won't be able to do any-

<BR>thing with her.&nbsp; She's running away with us now.

<BR>All we can do is to steer her.&nbsp; She's a ship without a

<BR>crew."



<P>"Yes.&nbsp; All laid low," repeated Ransome quietly.

<BR>"I do give them a look-in forward every now and

<BR>then, but it's precious little I can do for them."



<P>"I, and the ship, and every one on board of her,

<BR>are very much indebted to you, Ransome," I said

<BR>warmly.



<P>He made as though he had not heard me, and

<BR>steered in silence till I was ready to relieve him.&nbsp; He

<BR>surrendered the wheel, picked up the tray, and for a

<BR>parting shot informed me that Mr. Burns was awake

<BR>and seemed to have a mind to come up on deck.



<P>"I don't know how to prevent him, sir.&nbsp; I can't

<BR>very well stop down below all the time."



<P>It was clear that he couldn't.&nbsp; And sure enough

<BR>Mr. Burns came on deck dragging himself painfully

<BR>aft in his enormous overcoat.&nbsp; I beheld him with a

<BR>natural dread.&nbsp; To have him around and raving

<BR>about the wiles of a dead man while I had to steer a

<BR>wildly rushing ship full of dying men was a rather

<BR>dreadful prospect.



<P>But his first remarks were quite sensible in mean-

<BR>ing and tone.&nbsp; Apparently he had no recollection

<BR>of the night scene.&nbsp; And if he had he didn't betray

<BR>himself once.&nbsp; Neither did he talk very much.&nbsp; He

<BR>sat on the skylight looking desperately ill at first,

<BR>but that strong breeze, before which the last rem-

<BR>nant of my crew had wilted down, seemed to blow a

<BR>fresh stock of vigour into his frame with every gust.

<BR>One could almost see the process.



<P>By way of sanity test I alluded on purpose to the

<BR>late captain.&nbsp; I was delighted to find that Mr.

<BR>Burns did not display undue interest in the sub-

<BR>ject.&nbsp; He ran over the old tale of that savage

<BR>ruffian's iniquities with a certain vindictive gusto

<BR>and then concluded unexpectedly:



<P>"I do believe, sir, that his brain began to go a

<BR>year or more before he died."



<P>A wonderful recovery.&nbsp; I could hardly spare it

<BR>as much admiration as it deserved, for I had to give

<BR>all my mind to the steering.



<P>In comparison with the hopeless languour of the

<BR>preceding days this was dizzy speed.&nbsp; Two ridges

<BR>of foam streamed from the ship's bows; the wind

<BR>sang in a strenuous note which under other cir-

<BR>cumstances would have expressed to me all the joy

<BR>of life.&nbsp; Whenever the hauled-up mainsail started

<BR>trying to slat and bang itself to pieces in its gear,

<BR>Mr. Burns would look at me apprehensively.



<P>"What would you have me to do, Mr. Burns?

<BR>We can neither furl it nor set it.&nbsp; I only wish the

<BR>old thing would thrash itself to pieces and be done

<BR>with it.&nbsp; That beastly racket confuses me."



<P>Mr. Burns wrung his hands, and cried out sud-

<BR>denly:



<P>"How will you get the ship into harbour, sir,

<BR>without men to handle her?"



<P>And I couldn't tell him.



<P>Well--it did get done about forty hours after-

<BR>ward.&nbsp; By the exorcising virtue of Mr. Burns'

<BR>awful laugh, the malicious spectre had been laid,

<BR>the evil spell broken, the curse removed.&nbsp; We were

<BR>now in the hands of a kind and energetic Provi-

<BR>dence.&nbsp; It was rushing us on. . . .



<P>I shall never forget the last night, dark, windy,

<BR>and starry.&nbsp; I steered.&nbsp; Mr. Burns, after having

<BR>obtained from me a solemn promise to give him a

<BR>kick if anything happened, went frankly to sleep on

<BR>the deck close to the binnacle.&nbsp; Convalescents

<BR>need sleep.&nbsp; Ransome, his back propped against

<BR>the mizzen-mast and a blanket over his legs, re-

<BR>mained perfectly still, but I don't suppose he

<BR>closed his eyes for a moment.&nbsp; That embodiment

<BR>of jauntiness, Frenchy, still under the delusion that

<BR>there was a "jump" left in him, had insisted on

<BR>joining us; but mindful of discipline, had laid him-

<BR>self down as far on the forepart of the poop as he

<BR>could get, alongside the bucket-rack.



<P>And I steered, too tired for anxiety, too tired for

<BR>connected thought.&nbsp; I had moments of grim ex-

<BR>ultation and then my heart would sink awfully

<BR>at the thought of that forecastle at the other end

<BR>of the dark deck, full of fever-stricken men--some

<BR>of them dying.&nbsp; By my fault.&nbsp; But never mind.

<BR>Remorse must wait.&nbsp; I had to steer.



<P>In the small hours the breeze weakened, then

<BR>failed altogether.&nbsp; About five it returned, gentle

<BR>enough, enabling us to head for the roadstead.

<BR>Daybreak found Mr. Burns sitting wedged up with

<BR>coils of rope on the stern-grating, and from the

<BR>depths of his overcoat steering the ship with very

<BR>white bony hands; while Ransome and I rushed

<BR>along the decks letting go all the sheets and hal-

<BR>liards by the run.&nbsp; We dashed next up on to the

<BR>forecastle head.&nbsp; The perspiration of labour and

<BR>sheer nervousness simply poured off our heads as

<BR>we toiled to get the anchors cock-billed.&nbsp; I dared

<BR>not look at Ransome as we worked side by side.

<BR>We exchanged curt words; I could hear him panting

<BR>close to me and I avoided turning my eyes his way

<BR>for fear of seeing him fall down and expire in the

<BR>act of putting forth his strength--for what?&nbsp; In-

<BR>deed for some distinct ideal.



<P>The consummate seaman in him was aroused.

<BR>He needed no directions.&nbsp; He knew what to do.

<BR>Every effort, every movement was an act of con-

<BR>sistent heroism.&nbsp; It was not for me to look at a man

<BR>thus inspired.



<P>At last all was ready and I heard him say:



<P>"Hadn't I better go down and open the compressors now, sir?"



<P>"Yes.&nbsp; Do," I said.



<P>And even then I did not glance his way.&nbsp; After a

<BR>time his voice came up from the main deck.



<P>"When you like, sir.&nbsp; All clear on the windlass here."



<P>I made a sign to Mr. Burns to put the helm

<BR>down and let both anchors go one after another,

<BR>leaving the ship to take as much cable as she

<BR>wanted.&nbsp; She took the best part of them both be-

<BR>fore she brought up.&nbsp; The loose sails coming aback

<BR>ceased their maddening racket above my head.&nbsp; A

<BR>perfect stillness reigned in the ship.&nbsp; And while I

<BR>stood forward feeling a little giddy in that sudden

<BR>peace, I caught faintly a moan or two and the in-

<BR>coherent mutterings of the sick in the forecastle.



<P>As we had a signal for medical assistance flying

<BR>on the mizzen it is a fact that before the ship was

<BR>fairly at rest three steam launches from various

<BR>men-of-war were alongside; and at least five naval

<BR>surgeons had clambered on board.&nbsp; They stood in

<BR>a knot gazing up and down the empty main deck,

<BR>then looked aloft--where not a man could be seen,

<BR>either.



<P>I went toward them--a solitary figure, in a blue

<BR>and gray striped sleeping suit and a pipe-clayed cork

<BR>helmet on its head.&nbsp; Their disgust was extreme.

<BR>They had expected surgical cases.&nbsp; Each one had

<BR>brought his carving tools with him.&nbsp; But they soon

<BR>got over their little disappointment.&nbsp; In less than

<BR>five minutes one of the steam launches was rushing

<BR>shoreward to order a big boat and some hospital

<BR>people for the removal of the crew.&nbsp; The big

<BR>steam pinnace went off to her ship to bring over a

<BR>few bluejackets to furl my sails for me.



<P>One of the surgeons had remained on board.&nbsp; He

<BR>came out of the forecastle looking impenetrable,

<BR>and noticed my inquiring gaze.



<P>"There's nobody dead in there, if that's what

<BR>you want to know," he said deliberately.&nbsp; Then

<BR>added in a tone of wonder: "The whole crew!"



<P>"And very bad?"



<P>"And very bad," he repeated.&nbsp; His eyes were

<BR>roaming all over the ship.&nbsp; "Heavens!&nbsp; What's

<BR>that?"



<P>"That," I said, glancing aft, "is Mr. Burns, my

<BR>chief officer."



<P>Mr. Burns with his moribund head nodding on

<BR>the stalk of his lean neck was a sight for any one

<BR>to exclaim at.&nbsp; The surgeon asked:



<P>"Is he going to the hospital, too?"



<P>"Oh, no," I said jocosely.&nbsp; "Mr. Burns can't go

<BR>on shore till the mainmast goes.&nbsp; I am very proud

<BR>of him.&nbsp; He's my only convalescent."



<P>"You look--" began the doctor staring at me.

<BR>But I interrupted him angrily:



<P>"I am not ill."



<P>"No. . . .&nbsp; You look queer."



<P>"Well, you see, I have been seventeen days on deck."



<P>"Seventeen! . . .&nbsp; But you must have slept."



<P>"I suppose I must have.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; But I'm certain

<BR>that I didn't sleep for the last forty hours."



<P>"Phew! . . .&nbsp; You will be going ashore presently I suppose?"



<P>"As soon as ever I can.&nbsp; There's no end of

<BR>business waiting for me there."



<P>The surgeon released my hand, which he had

<BR>taken while we talked, pulled out his pocket-book,

<BR>wrote in it rapidly, tore out the page and offered

<BR>it to me.



<P>"I strongly advise you to get this prescription

<BR>made up for yourself ashore.&nbsp; Unless I am much

<BR>mistaken you will need it this evening."



<P>"What is it, then?" I asked with suspicion.



<P>"Sleeping draught," answered the surgeon

<BR>curtly; and moving with an air of interest toward

<BR>Mr. Burns he engaged him in conversation.



<P>As I went below to dress to go ashore, Ransome

<BR>followed me.&nbsp; He begged my pardon; he wished,

<BR>too, to be sent ashore and paid off.



<P>I looked at him in surprise.&nbsp; He was waiting for

<BR>my answer with an air of anxiety.



<P>"You don't mean to leave the ship!" I cried

<BR>out.



<P>"I do really, sir.&nbsp; I want to go and be quiet some-

<BR>where.&nbsp; Anywhere.&nbsp; The hospital will do."



<P>"But, Ransome," I said.&nbsp; "I hate the idea of

<BR>parting with you."



<P>"I must go," he broke in.&nbsp; "I have a right!"

<BR>. . .&nbsp; He gasped and a look of almost savage de-

<BR>termination passed over his face.&nbsp; For an instant

<BR>he was another being.&nbsp; And I saw under the worth

<BR>and the comeliness of the man the humble reality

<BR>of things.&nbsp; Life was a boon to him--this precarious

<BR>hard life, and he was thoroughly alarmed about

<BR>himself.



<P>"Of course I shall pay you off if you wish it," I

<BR>hastened to say.&nbsp; "Only I must ask you to remain

<BR>on board till this afternoon.&nbsp; I can't leave Mr.

<BR>Burns absolutely by himself in the ship for hours."



<P>He softened at once and assured me with a smile

<BR>and in his natural pleasant voice that he under-

<BR>stood that very well.



<P>When I returned on deck everything was ready

<BR>for the removal of the men.&nbsp; It was the last ordeal

<BR>of that episode which had been maturing and tem-

<BR>pering my character--though I did not know it.



<P>It was awful.&nbsp; They passed under my eyes one

<BR>after another--each of them an embodied reproach

<BR>of the bitterest kind, till I felt a sort of revolt wake

<BR>up in me.&nbsp; Poor Frenchy had gone suddenly under.

<BR>He was carried past me insensible, his comic

<BR>face horribly flushed and as if swollen, breathing

<BR>stertorously.&nbsp; He looked more like Mr. Punch than

<BR>ever; a disgracefully intoxicated Mr. Punch.



<P>The austere Gambril, on the contrary, had im-

<BR>proved temporarily.&nbsp; He insisted on walking on

<BR>his own feet to the rail--of course with assistance

<BR>on each side of him.&nbsp; But he gave way to a sudden

<BR>panic at the moment of being swung over the side

<BR>and began to wail pitifully:



<P>"Don't let them drop me, sir.&nbsp; Don't let them

<BR>drop me, sir!"&nbsp; While I kept on shouting to him in

<BR>most soothing accents: "All right, Gambril.

<BR>They won't!&nbsp; They won't!"



<P>It was no doubt very ridiculous.&nbsp; The blue-

<BR>jackets on our deck were grinning quietly, while

<BR>even Ransome himself (much to the fore in lending

<BR>a hand) had to enlarge his wistful smile for a fleet-

<BR>ing moment.



<P>I left for the shore in the steam pinnace, and on

<BR>looking back beheld Mr. Burns actually standing

<BR>up by the taffrail, still in his enormous woolly over-

<BR>coat.&nbsp; The bright sunlight brought out his weird-

<BR>ness amazingly.&nbsp; He looked like a frightful and

<BR>elaborate scarecrow set up on the poop of a death-

<BR>stricken ship, set up to keep the seabirds from the

<BR>corpses.



<P>Our story had got about already in town and

<BR>everybody on shore was most kind.&nbsp; The Marine

<BR>Office let me off the port dues, and as there hap-

<BR>pened to be a shipwrecked crew staying in the

<BR>Home I had no difficulty in obtaining as many men

<BR>as I wanted.&nbsp; But when I inquired if I could see

<BR>Captain Ellis for a moment I was told in accents of

<BR>pity for my ignorance that our deputy-Neptune

<BR>had retired and gone home on a pension about

<BR>three weeks after I left the port.&nbsp; So I suppose that

<BR>my appointment was the last act, outside the

<BR>daily routine, of his official life.



<P>It is strange how on coming ashore I was struck

<BR>by the springy step, the lively eyes, the strong

<BR>vitality of every one I met.&nbsp; It impressed me

<BR>enormously.&nbsp; And amongst those I met there was

<BR>Captain Giles, of course.&nbsp; It would have been very

<BR>extraordinary if I had not met him.&nbsp; A prolonged

<BR>stroll in the business part of the town was the

<BR>regular employment of all his mornings when he

<BR>was ashore.



<P>I caught the glitter of the gold watch-chain

<BR>across his chest ever so far away.&nbsp; He radiated

<BR>benevolence.



<P>"What is it I hear?" he queried with a "kind

<BR>uncle" smile, after shaking hands.&nbsp; "Twenty-one

<BR>days from Bangkok?"



<P>"Is this all you've heard?" I said.&nbsp; "You must

<BR>come to tiffin with me.&nbsp; I want you to know ex-

<BR>actly what you have let me in for."



<P>He hesitated for almost a minute.



<P>"Well--I will," he said condescendingly at last.



<P>We turned into the hotel.&nbsp; I found to my sur-

<BR>prise that I could eat quite a lot.&nbsp; Then over the

<BR>cleared table-cloth I unfolded to Captain Giles the

<BR>history of these twenty days in all its professional

<BR>and emotional aspects, while he smoked patiently

<BR>the big cigar I had given him.



<P>Then he observed sagely:



<P>"You must feel jolly well tired by this time."



<P>"No," I said.&nbsp; "Not tired.&nbsp; But I'll tell you,

<BR>Captain Giles, how I feel.&nbsp; I feel old.&nbsp; And I must

<BR>be.&nbsp; All of you on shore look to me just a lot of

<BR>skittish youngsters that have never known a care

<BR>in the world."



<P>He didn't smile.&nbsp; He looked insufferably ex-

<BR>emplary.&nbsp; He declared:



<P>"That will pass.&nbsp; But you do look older--it's a

<BR>fact."



<P>"Aha!" I said.



<P>"No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; The truth is that one must not make

<BR>too much of anything in life, good or bad."



<P>"Live at half-speed," I murmured perversely.

<BR>"Not everybody can do that."



<P>"You'll be glad enough presently if you can keep

<BR>going even at that rate," he retorted with his air of

<BR>conscious virtue.&nbsp; "And there's another thing: a

<BR>man should stand up to his bad luck, to his mis-

<BR>takes, to his conscience and all that sort of thing.

<BR>Why--what else would you have to fight against."



<P>I kept silent.&nbsp; I don't know what he saw in my

<BR>face but he asked abruptly:



<P>"Why--you aren't faint-hearted?"



<P>"God only knows, Captain Giles," was my sin-

<BR>cere answer.



<P>"That's all right," he said calmly.&nbsp; "You will

<BR>learn soon how not to be faint-hearted.&nbsp; A man has

<BR>got to learn everything--and that's what so many

<BR>of them youngsters don't understand."



<P>"Well, I am no longer a youngster."



<P>"No," he conceded.&nbsp; "Are you leaving soon?"



<P>"I am going on board directly," I said.&nbsp; "I shall

<BR>pick up one of my anchors and heave in to half-

<BR>cable on the other directly my new crew comes on

<BR>board and I shall be off at daylight to-morrow!"



<P>"You will," grunted Captain Giles approvingly.

<BR>"that's the way.&nbsp; You'll do."



<P>"What did you think?&nbsp; That I would want to

<BR>take a week ashore for a rest?" I said, irritated by

<BR>his tone.&nbsp; "There's no rest for me till she's out

<BR>in the Indian Ocean and not much of it even

<BR>then."



<P>He puffed at his cigar moodily, as if transformed.



<P>"Yes.&nbsp; That's what it amounts to," he said in a

<BR>musing tone.&nbsp; It was as if a ponderous curtain had

<BR>rolled up disclosing an unexpected Captain Giles.

<BR>But it was only for a moment, just the time to let

<BR>him add, "Precious little rest in life for anybody.

<BR>Better not think of it."



<P>We rose, left the hotel, and parted from each

<BR>other in the street with a warm handshake, just as

<BR>he began to interest me for the first time in our

<BR>intercourse.



<P>The first thing I saw when I got back to the ship

<BR>was Ransome on the quarter-deck sitting quietly

<BR>on his neatly lashed sea-chest.



<P>I beckoned him to follow me into the saloon

<BR>where I sat down to write a letter of recommenda-

<BR>tion for him to a man I knew on shore.



<P>When finished I pushed it across the table.&nbsp; "It

<BR>may be of some good to you when you leave the

<BR>hospital."



<P>He took it, put it in his pocket.&nbsp; His eyes were

<BR>looking away from me--nowhere.&nbsp; His face was

<BR>anxiously set.



<P>"How are you feeling now?" I asked.



<P>"I don't feel bad now, sir," he answered stiffly.

<BR>"But I am afraid of its coming on. . . ."&nbsp; The

<BR>wistful smile came back on his lips for a mo-

<BR>ment.&nbsp; "I--I am in a blue funk about my heart,

<BR>sir."



<P>I approached him with extended hand.&nbsp; His

<BR>eyes not looking at me had a strained expres-

<BR>sion.&nbsp; He was like a man listening for a warning

<BR>call.



<P>"Won't you shake hands, Ransome?" I said

<BR>gently.



<P>He exclaimed, flushed up dusky red, gave my

<BR>hand a hard wrench--and next moment, left alone

<BR>in the cabin, I listened to him going up the com-

<BR>panion stairs cautiously, step by step, in mortal

<BR>fear of starting into sudden anger our common

<BR>enemy it was his hard fate to carry consciously

<BR>within his faithful breast.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE first thing I saw down there was the upper part

<BR>of a man's body projecting backward, as it were,

<BR>from one of the doors at the foot of the stairs.&nbsp; His

<BR>eyes looked at me very wide and still.&nbsp; In one hand

<BR>he held a dinner plate, in the other a cloth.



<P>"I am your new Captain," I said quietly.



<P>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, he had

<BR>got rid of the plate and the cloth and jumped to

<BR>open the cabin door.&nbsp; As soon as I passed into the

<BR>saloon he vanished, but only to reappear instantly,

<BR>buttoning up a jacket he had put on with the

<BR>swiftness of a "quick-change" artist.



<P>"Where's the chief mate?" I asked.



<P>"In the hold, I think, sir.&nbsp; I saw him go down

<BR>the after-hatch ten minutes ago."



<P>"Tell him I am on board."



<P>The mahogany table under the skylight shone in

<BR>the twilight like a dark pool of water.&nbsp; The side-

<BR>board, surmounted by a wide looking-glass in an

<BR>ormulu frame, had a marble top.&nbsp; It bore a pair of

<BR>silver-plated lamps and some other pieces--

<BR>obviously a harbour display.&nbsp; The saloon itself

<BR>was panelled in two kinds of wood in the excellent

<BR>simple taste prevailing when the ship was built.



<P>I sat down in the armchair at the head of the

<BR>table--the captain's chair, with a small tell-tale

<BR>compass swung above it--a mute reminder of un-

<BR>remitting vigilance.



<P>A succession of men had sat in that chair.&nbsp; I be-

<BR>came aware of that thought suddenly, vividly, as

<BR>though each had left a little of himself between the

<BR>four walls of these ornate bulkheads; as if a sort of

<BR>composite soul, the soul of command, had whispered

<BR>suddenly to mine of long days at sea and of anxious

<BR>moments.



<P>"You, too!" it seemed to say, "you, too, shall

<BR>taste of that peace and that unrest in a searching

<BR>intimacy with your own self--obscure as we were

<BR>and as supreme in the face of all the winds and all

<BR>the seas, in an immensity that receives no impress,

<BR>preserves no memories, and keeps no reckoning of

<BR>lives."



<P>Deep within the tarnished ormulu frame, in the

<BR>hot half-light sifted through the awning, I saw my

<BR>own face propped between my hands.&nbsp; And I

<BR>stared back at myself with the perfect detachment

<BR>of distance, rather with curiosity than with any

<BR>other feeling, except of some sympathy for this

<BR>latest representative of what for all intents and

<BR>purposes was a dynasty, continuous not in blood

<BR>indeed, but in its experience, in its training, in its

<BR>conception of duty, and in the blessed simplicity of

<BR>its traditional point of view on life.



<P>It struck me that this quietly staring man whom

<BR>I was watching, both as if he were myself and some-

<BR>body else, was not exactly a lonely figure.&nbsp; He had

<BR>his place in a line of men whom he did not know, of

<BR>whom he had never heard; but who were fashioned

<BR>by the same influences, whose souls in relation to

<BR>their humble life's work had no secrets for him.



<P>Suddenly I perceived that there was another man

<BR>in the saloon, standing a little on one side and look-

<BR>ing intently at me.&nbsp; The chief mate.&nbsp; His long,

<BR>red moustache determined the character of his

<BR>physiognomy, which struck me as pugnacious in

<BR>(strange to say) a ghastly sort of way.



<P>How long had he been there looking at me, ap-

<BR>praising me in my unguarded day-dreaming state?

<BR>I would have been more disconcerted if, having the

<BR>clock set in the top of the mirror-frame right in

<BR>front of me, I had not noticed that its long hand

<BR>had hardly moved at all.



<P>I could not have been in that cabin more than

<BR>two minutes altogether.&nbsp; Say three. . . .&nbsp; So

<BR>he could not have been watching me more than a

<BR>mere fraction of a minute, luckily.&nbsp; Still, I re-

<BR>gretted the occurrence.



<P>But I showed nothing of it as I rose leisurely (it

<BR>had to be leisurely) and greeted him with perfect

<BR>friendliness.



<P>There was something reluctant and at the same

<BR>time attentive in his bearing.&nbsp; His name was

<BR>Burns.&nbsp; We left the cabin and went round the ship

<BR>together.&nbsp; His face in the full light of day ap-

<BR>peared very pale, meagre, even haggard.&nbsp; Some-

<BR>how I had a delicacy as to looking too often at him;

<BR>his eyes, on the contrary, remained fairly glued on

<BR>my face.&nbsp; They were greenish and had an ex-

<BR>pectant expression.



<P>He answered all my questions readily enough,

<BR>but my ear seemed to catch a tone of unwillingness.

<BR>The second officer, with three or four hands, was

<BR>busy forward.&nbsp; The mate mentioned his name and

<BR>I nodded to him in passing.&nbsp; He was very young.

<BR>He struck me as rather a cub.



<P>When we returned below, I sat down on one end

<BR>of a deep, semi-circular, or, rather, semi-oval settee,

<BR>upholstered in red plush.&nbsp; It extended right across

<BR>the whole after-end of the cabin.&nbsp; Mr. Burns

<BR>motioned to sit down, dropped into one of the

<BR>swivel-chairs round the table, and kept his eyes on

<BR>me as persistently as ever, and with that strange air

<BR>as if all this were make-believe and he expected me

<BR>to get up, burst into a laugh, slap him on the back,

<BR>and vanish from the cabin.



<P>There was an odd stress in the situation which

<BR>began to make me uncomfortable.&nbsp; I tried to react

<BR>against this vague feeling.



<P>"It's only my inexperience," I thought.



<P>In the face of that man, several years, I judged,

<BR>older than myself, I became aware of what I had

<BR>left already behind me--my youth.&nbsp; And that was

<BR>indeed poor comfort.&nbsp; Youth is a fine thing, a

<BR>mighty power--as long as one does not think of

<BR>it.&nbsp; I felt I was becoming self-conscious.&nbsp; Almost

<BR>against my will I assumed a moody gravity.&nbsp; I

<BR>said: "I see you have kept her in very good order,

<BR>Mr. Burns."



<P>Directly I had uttered these words I asked my-

<BR>self angrily why the deuce did I want to say that?

<BR>Mr. Burns in answer had only blinked at me.&nbsp; What

<BR>on earth did he mean?



<P>I fell back on a question which had been in my

<BR>thoughts for a long time--the most natural ques-

<BR>tion on the lips of any seaman whatever joining a

<BR>ship.&nbsp; I voiced it (confound this self-consciousness)

<BR>in a degage cheerful tone: "I suppose she can travel

<BR>--what?"



<P>Now a question like this might have been an-

<BR>swered normally, either in accents of apologetic

<BR>sorrow or with a visibly suppressed pride, in a "I

<BR>don't want to boast, but you shall see," sort of

<BR>tone.&nbsp; There are sailors, too, who would have been

<BR>roughly outspoken: "Lazy brute," or openly de-

<BR>lighted: "She's a flyer."&nbsp; Two ways, if four

<BR>manners.



<P>But Mr. Burns found another way, a way of his

<BR>own which had, at all events, the merit of saving

<BR>his breath, if no other.



<P>Again he did not say anything.&nbsp; He only

<BR>frowned.&nbsp; And it was an angry frown.&nbsp; I waited.

<BR>Nothing more came.



<P>"What's the matter? . . .&nbsp; Can't you tell

<BR>after being nearly two years in the ship?"&nbsp; I ad-

<BR>dressed him sharply.



<P>He looked as startled for a moment as though he

<BR>had discovered my presence only that very mo-

<BR>ment.&nbsp; But this passed off almost at once.&nbsp; He

<BR>put on an air of indifference.&nbsp; But I suppose he

<BR>thought it better to say something.&nbsp; He said that a

<BR>ship needed, just like a man, the chance to show the

<BR>best she could do, and that this ship had never had

<BR>a chance since he had been on board of her.&nbsp; Not

<BR>that he could remember.&nbsp; The last captain. . . .

<BR>He paused.



<P>"Has he been so very unlucky?" I asked with

<BR>frank incredulity.&nbsp; Mr. Burns turned his eyes away

<BR>from me.&nbsp; No, the late captain was not an unlucky

<BR>man.&nbsp; One couldn't say that.&nbsp; But he had not

<BR>seemed to want to make use of his luck.



<P>Mr. Burns--man of enigmatic moods--made

<BR>this statement with an inanimate face and staring

<BR>wilfully at the rudder casing.&nbsp; The statement itself

<BR>was obscurely suggestive.&nbsp; I asked quietly:



<P>"Where did he die?"



<P>"In this saloon.&nbsp; Just where you are sitting

<BR>now," answered Mr. Burns.



<P>I repressed a silly impulse to jump up; but upon

<BR>the whole I was relieved to hear that he had not

<BR>died in the bed which was now to be mine.&nbsp; I

<BR>pointed out to the chief mate that what I really

<BR>wanted to know was where he had buried his late

<BR>captain.



<P>Mr. Burns said that it was at the entrance to the

<BR>gulf.&nbsp; A roomy grave; a sufficient answer.&nbsp; But

<BR>the mate, overcoming visibly something within him

<BR>--something like a curious reluctance to believe in

<BR>my advent (as an irrevocable fact, at any rate), did

<BR>not stop at that--though, indeed, he may have

<BR>wished to do so.



<P>As a compromise with his feelings, I believe, he

<BR>addressed himself persistently to the rudder-casing,

<BR>so that to me he had the appearance of a man

<BR>talking in solitude, a little unconsciously, however.



<P>His tale was that at seven bells in the forenoon

<BR>watch he had all hands mustered on the quarter-

<BR>deck and told them they had better go down to say

<BR>good-bye to the captain.



<P>Those words, as if grudged to an intruding per-

<BR>sonage, were enough for me to evoke vividly that

<BR>strange ceremony: The bare-footed, bare-headed

<BR>seamen crowding shyly into that cabin, a small

<BR>mob pressed against that sideboard, uncomfortable

<BR>rather than moved, shirts open on sunburnt chests,

<BR>weather-beaten faces, and all staring at the dying

<BR>man with the same grave and expectant expression.



<P>"Was he conscious?" I asked.



<P>"He didn't speak, but he moved his eyes to look

<BR>at them," said the mate.



<P>After waiting a moment, Mr. Burns motioned

<BR>the crew to leave the cabin, but he detained the two

<BR>eldest men to stay with the captain while he went

<BR>on deck with his sextant to "take the sun."&nbsp; It

<BR>was getting toward noon and he was anxious to

<BR>obtain a good observation for latitude.&nbsp; When he

<BR>returned below to put his sextant away he found

<BR>that the two men had retreated out into the lobby.

<BR>Through the open door he had a view of the captain

<BR>lying easy against the pillows.&nbsp; He had "passed

<BR>away" while Mr. Burns was taking this observa-

<BR>tion.&nbsp; As near noon as possible.&nbsp; He had hardly

<BR>changed his position.



<P>Mr. Burns sighed, glanced at me inquisitively,

<BR>as much as to say, "Aren't you going yet?" and then

<BR>turned his thoughts from his new captain back to

<BR>the old, who, being dead, had no authority, was not

<BR>in anybody's way, and was much easier to deal with.



<P>Mr. Burns dealt with him at some length.&nbsp; He

<BR>was a peculiar man--of sixty-five about--iron gray,

<BR>hard-faced, obstinate, and uncommunicative.&nbsp; He

<BR>used to keep the ship loafing at sea for inscrutable

<BR>reasons.&nbsp; Would come on deck at night sometimes,

<BR>take some sail off her, God only knows why or

<BR>wherefore, then go below, shut himself up in his

<BR>cabin, and play on the violin for hours--till day-

<BR>break perhaps.&nbsp; In fact, he spent most of his time

<BR>day or night playing the violin.&nbsp; That was when

<BR>the fit took him.&nbsp; Very loud, too.



<P>It came to this, that Mr. Burns mustered his

<BR>courage one day and remonstrated earnestly with

<BR>the captain.&nbsp; Neither he nor the second mate

<BR>could get a wink of sleep in their watches below for

<BR>the noise. . . .&nbsp; And how could they be ex-

<BR>pected to keep awake while on duty?&nbsp; He pleaded.

<BR>The answer of that stern man was that if he and the

<BR>second mate didn't like the noise, they were wel-

<BR>come to pack up their traps and walk over the side.

<BR>When this alternative was offered the ship hap-

<BR>pened to be 600 miles from the nearest land.



<P>Mr. Burns at this point looked at me with an air

<BR>of curiosity.&nbsp; I began to think that my predecessor

<BR>was a remarkably peculiar old man.



<P>But I had to hear stranger things yet.&nbsp; It came

<BR>out that this stern, grim, wind-tanned, rough, sea-

<BR>salted, taciturn sailor of sixty-five was not only an

<BR>artist, but a lover as well.&nbsp; In Haiphong, when

<BR>they got there after a course of most unprofitable

<BR>peregrinations (during which the ship was nearly

<BR>lost twice), he got himself, in Mr. Burns' own

<BR>words, "mixed up" with some woman.&nbsp; Mr. Burns

<BR>had had no personal knowledge of that affair, but

<BR>positive evidence of it existed in the shape of a

<BR>photograph taken in Haiphong.&nbsp; Mr. Burns found

<BR>it in one of the drawers in the captain's room.



<P>In due course I, too, saw that amazing human

<BR>document (I even threw it overboard later).

<BR>There he sat, with his hands reposing on his knees,

<BR>bald, squat, gray, bristly, recalling a wild boar

<BR>somehow; and by his side towered an awful mature,

<BR>white female with rapacious nostrils and a cheaply

<BR>ill-omened stare in her enormous eyes.&nbsp; She was

<BR>disguised in some semi-oriental, vulgar, fancy

<BR>costume.&nbsp; She resembled a low-class medium or

<BR>one of those women who tell fortunes by cards for

<BR>half a crown.&nbsp; And yet she was striking.&nbsp; A pro-

<BR>fessional sorceress from the slums.&nbsp; It was incom-

<BR>prehensible.&nbsp; There was something awful in the

<BR>thought that she was the last reflection of the world

<BR>of passion for the fierce soul which seemed to look

<BR>at one out of the sardonically savage face of that old

<BR>seaman.&nbsp; However, I noticed that she was holding

<BR>some musical instrument--guitar or mandoline--

<BR>in her hand.&nbsp; Perhaps that was the secret of her

<BR>sortilege.



<P>For Mr. Burns that photograph explained why

<BR>the unloaded ship had kept sweltering at anchor

<BR>for three weeks in a pestilential hot harbour with-

<BR>out air.&nbsp; They lay there and gasped.&nbsp; The cap-

<BR>tain, appearing now and then on short visits,

<BR>mumbled to Mr. Burns unlikely tales about some

<BR>letters he was waiting for.



<P>Suddenly, after vanishing for a week, he came on

<BR>board in the middle of the night and took the ship

<BR>out to sea with the first break of dawn.&nbsp; Daylight

<BR>showed him looking wild and ill.&nbsp; The mere getting

<BR>clear of the land took two days, and somehow or

<BR>other they bumped slightly on a reef.&nbsp; However,

<BR>no leak developed, and the captain, growling "no

<BR>matter," informed Mr. Burns that he had made up

<BR>his mind to take the ship to Hong-Kong and dry-

<BR>dock her there.



<P>At this Mr. Burns was plunged into despair.&nbsp; For

<BR>indeed, to beat up to Hong-Kong against a fierce

<BR>monsoon, with a ship not sufficiently ballasted and

<BR>with her supply of water not completed, was an in-

<BR>sane project.



<P>But the captain growled peremptorily, "Stick

<BR>her at it," and Mr. Burns, dismayed and enraged,

<BR>stuck her at it, and kept her at it, blowing away

<BR>sails, straining the spars, exhausting the crew--

<BR>nearly maddened by the absolute conviction that

<BR>the attempt was impossible and was bound to end

<BR>in some catastrophe.



<P>Meantime the captain, shut up in his cabin and

<BR>wedged in a corner of his settee against the crazy

<BR>bounding of the ship, played the violin--or, at any

<BR>rate, made continuous noise on it.



<P>When he appeared on deck he would not speak

<BR>and not always answer when spoken to.&nbsp; It was

<BR>obvious that he was ill in some mysterious manner,

<BR>and beginning to break up.



<P>As the days went by the sounds of the violin be-

<BR>came less and less loud, till at last only a feeble

<BR>scratching would meet Mr. Burns' ear as he stood

<BR>in the saloon listening outside the door of the cap-

<BR>tain's state-room.



<P>One afternoon in perfect desperation he burst

<BR>into that room and made such a scene, tearing his

<BR>hair and shouting such horrid imprecations that he

<BR>cowed the contemptuous spirit of the sick man.

<BR>The water-tanks were low, they had not gained fifty

<BR>miles in a fortnight.&nbsp; She would never reach Hong-

<BR>Kong.



<P>It was like fighting desperately toward destruc-

<BR>tion for the ship and the men.&nbsp; This was evident

<BR>without argument.&nbsp; Mr. Burns, losing all restraint,

<BR>put his face close to his captain's and fairly

<BR>yelled: "You, sir, are going out of the world.&nbsp; But

<BR>I can't wait till you are dead before I put the helm

<BR>up.&nbsp; You must do it yourself.&nbsp; You must do it

<BR>now!"



<P>The man on the couch snarled in contempt.

<BR>"So I am going out of the world--am I?"



<P>"Yes, sir--you haven't many days left in it,"

<BR>said Mr. Burns calming down.&nbsp; "One can see it by

<BR>your face."



<P>"My face, eh? . . .&nbsp; Well, put up the helm

<BR>and be damned to you."



<P>Burns flew on deck, got the ship before the wind,

<BR>then came down again composed, but resolute.



<P>"I've shaped a course for Pulo Condor, sir," he

<BR>said.&nbsp; "When we make it, if you are still with us,

<BR>you'll tell me into what port you wish me to take

<BR>the ship and I'll do it."



<P>The old man gave him a look of savage spite,

<BR>and said those atrocious words in deadly, slow

<BR>tones.



<P>"If I had my wish, neither the ship nor any of

<BR>you would ever reach a port.&nbsp; And I hope you

<BR>won't."



<P>Mr. Burns was profoundly shocked.&nbsp; I believe

<BR>he was positively frightened at the time.&nbsp; It seems,

<BR>however, that he managed to produce such an

<BR>effective laugh that it was the old man's turn to be

<BR>frightened.&nbsp; He shrank within himself and turned

<BR>his back on him.



<P>"And his head was not gone then," Mr. Burns

<BR>assured me excitedly.&nbsp; "He meant every word of it."



<P>"Such was practically the late captain's last

<BR>speech.&nbsp; No connected sentence passed his lips

<BR>afterward.&nbsp; That night he used the last of his

<BR>strength to throw his fiddle over the side.&nbsp; No one

<BR>had actually seen him in the act, but after his

<BR>death Mr. Burns couldn't find the thing anywhere.

<BR>The empty case was very much in evidence, but

<BR>the fiddle was clearly not in the ship.&nbsp; And where

<BR>else could it have gone to but overboard?"



<P>"Threw his violin overboard!" I exclaimed.



<P>"He did," cried Mr. Burns excitedly.&nbsp; "And

<BR>it's my belief he would have tried to take the ship

<BR>down with him if it had been in human power.&nbsp; He

<BR>never meant her to see home again.&nbsp; He wouldn't

<BR>write to his owners, he never wrote to his old wife,

<BR>either--he wasn't going to.&nbsp; He had made up his

<BR>mind to cut adrift from everything.&nbsp; That's what

<BR>it was.&nbsp; He didn't care for business, or freights, or

<BR>for making a passage--or anything.&nbsp; He meant to

<BR>have gone wandering about the world till he lost her

<BR>with all hands."



<P>Mr. Burns looked like a man who had escaped

<BR>great danger.&nbsp; For a little he would have ex-

<BR>claimed: "If it hadn't been for me!"&nbsp; And the

<BR>transparent innocence of his indignant eyes was

<BR>underlined quaintly by the arrogant pair of

<BR>moustaches which he proceeded to twist, and as if

<BR>extend, horizontally.



<P>I might have smiled if I had not been busy with

<BR>my own sensations, which were not those of Mr.

<BR>Burns.&nbsp; I was already the man in command.&nbsp; My

<BR>sensations could not be like those of any other man

<BR>on board.&nbsp; In that community I stood, like a king

<BR>in his country, in a class all by myself.&nbsp; I mean an

<BR>hereditary king, not a mere elected head of a state.

<BR>I was brought there to rule by an agency as remote

<BR>from the people and as inscrutable almost to them

<BR>as the Grace of God.



<P>And like a member of a dynasty, feeling a semi-

<BR>mystical bond with the dead, I was profoundly

<BR>shocked by my immediate predecessor.



<P>That man had been in all essentials but his age

<BR>just such another man as myself.&nbsp; Yet the end of

<BR>his life was a complete act of treason, the betrayal

<BR>of a tradition which seemed to me as imperative as

<BR>any guide on earth could be.&nbsp; It appeared that

<BR>even at sea a man could become the victim of evil

<BR>spirits.&nbsp; I felt on my face the breath of unknown

<BR>powers that shape our destinies.



<P>Not to let the silence last too long I asked Mr.

<BR>Burns if he had written to his captain's wife.&nbsp; He

<BR>shook his head.&nbsp; He had written to nobody.



<P>In a moment he became sombre.&nbsp; He never

<BR>thought of writing.&nbsp; It took him all his time to

<BR>watch incessantly the loading of the ship by a

<BR>rascally Chinese stevedore.&nbsp; In this Mr. Burns

<BR>gave me the first glimpse of the real chief mate's

<BR>soul which dwelt uneasily in his body.



<P>He mused, then hastened on with gloomy

<BR>force.



<P>"Yes!&nbsp; The captain died as near noon as pos-

<BR>sible.&nbsp; I looked through his papers in the afternoon.

<BR>I read the service over him at sunset and then I

<BR>stuck the ship's head north and brought her in

<BR>here.&nbsp; I--brought--her--in."



<P>He struck the table with his fist.



<P>"She would hardly have come in by herself," I

<BR>observed.&nbsp; "But why didn't you make for Singa-

<BR>pore instead?"



<P>His eyes wavered.&nbsp; "The nearest port," he

<BR>muttered sullenly.



<P>I had framed the question in perfect innocence,

<BR>but his answer (the difference in distance was in-

<BR>significant) and his manner offered me a clue to the

<BR>simple truth.&nbsp; He took the ship to a port where he

<BR>expected to be confirmed in his temporary com-

<BR>mand from lack of a qualified master to put over his

<BR>head.&nbsp; Whereas Singapore, he surmised justly,

<BR>would be full of qualified men.&nbsp; But his naive

<BR>reasoning forgot to take into account the telegraph

<BR>cable reposing on the bottom of the very Gulf up

<BR>which he had turned that ship which he imagined

<BR>himself to have saved from destruction.&nbsp; Hence

<BR>the bitter flavour of our interview.&nbsp; I tasted it

<BR>more and more distinctly--and it was less and less

<BR>to my taste.



<P>"Look here, Mr. Burns," I began very firmly.

<BR>"You may as well understand that I did not run

<BR>after this command.&nbsp; It was pushed in my way.

<BR>I've accepted it.&nbsp; I am here to take the ship home

<BR>first of all, and you may be sure that I shall see

<BR>to it that every one of you on board here does his

<BR>duty to that end.&nbsp; This is all I have to say--for

<BR>the present."



<P>He was on his feet by this time, but instead of

<BR>taking his dismissal he remained with trembling,

<BR>indignant lips, and looking at me hard as though,

<BR>really, after this, there was nothing for me to do in

<BR>common decency but to vanish from his outraged

<BR>sight.&nbsp; Like all very simple emotional states this

<BR>was moving.&nbsp; I felt sorry for him--almost sympa-

<BR>thetic, till (seeing that I did not vanish) he spoke

<BR>in a tone of forced restraint.



<P>"If I hadn't a wife and a child at home you may

<BR>be sure, sir, I would have asked you to let me go the

<BR>very minute you came on board."



<P>I answered him with a matter-of-course calmness

<BR>as though some remote third person were in question.



<P>"And I, Mr. Burns, would not have let you go.

<BR>You have signed the ship's articles as chief officer,

<BR>and till they are terminated at the final port of

<BR>discharge I shall expect you to attend to your duty

<BR>and give me the benefit of your experience to the

<BR>best of your ability."



<P>Stony incredulity lingered in his eyes: but it

<BR>broke down before my friendly attitude.&nbsp; With a

<BR>slight upward toss of his arms (I got to know that

<BR>gesture well afterward) he bolted out of the

<BR>cabin.



<P>We might have saved ourselves that little pas-

<BR>sage of harmless sparring.&nbsp; Before many days had

<BR>elapsed it was Mr. Burns who was pleading with

<BR>me anxiously not to leave him behind; while I could

<BR>only return him but doubtful answers.&nbsp; The whole

<BR>thing took on a somewhat tragic complexion.



<P>And this horrible problem was only an extrane-

<BR>ous episode, a mere complication in the general

<BR>problem of how to get that ship--which was mine

<BR>with her appurtenances and her men, with her body

<BR>and her spirit now slumbering in that pestilential

<BR>river--how to get her out to sea.



<P>Mr. Burns, while still acting captain, had

<BR>hastened to sign a charter-party which in an ideal

<BR>world without guile would have been an excellent

<BR>document.&nbsp; Directly I ran my eye over it I fore-

<BR>saw trouble ahead unless the people of the other

<BR>part were quite exceptionally fair-minded and open

<BR>to argument.



<P>Mr. Burns, to whom I imparted my fears, chose

<BR>to take great umbrage at them.&nbsp; He looked at me

<BR>with that usual incredulous stare, and said bitterly:



<P>"I suppose, sir, you want to make out I've acted

<BR>like a fool?"



<P>I told him, with my systematic kindliness which

<BR>always seemed to augment his surprise, that I did

<BR>not want to make out anything.&nbsp; I would leave

<BR>that to the future.



<P>And, sure enough, the future brought in a lot of

<BR>trouble.&nbsp; There were days when I used to remem-

<BR>ber Captain Giles with nothing short of abhor-

<BR>rence.&nbsp; His confounded acuteness had let me in

<BR>for this job; while his prophecy that I "would have

<BR>my hands full" coming true, made it appear as if

<BR>done on purpose to play an evil joke on my young

<BR>innocence.



<P>Yes.&nbsp; I had my hands full of complications which

<BR>were most valuable as "experience."&nbsp; People have

<BR>a great opinion of the advantages of experience.

<BR>But in this connection experience means always

<BR>something disagreeable as opposed to the charm

<BR>and innocence of illusions.



<P>I must say I was losing mine rapidly.&nbsp; But on

<BR>these instructive complications I must not enlarge

<BR>more than to say that they could all be resumed in

<BR>the one word: Delay.



<P>A mankind which has invented the proverb,

<BR>"Time is money," will understand my vexation.

<BR>The word "Delay" entered the secret chamber of

<BR>my brain, resounded there like a tolling bell which

<BR>maddens the ear, affected all my senses, took on a

<BR>black colouring, a bitter taste, a deadly meaning.



<P>"I am really sorry to see you worried like this.

<BR>Indeed, I am. . . ."



<P>It was the only humane speech I used to hear at

<BR>that time.&nbsp; And it came from a doctor, ap-

<BR>propriately enough.



<P>A doctor is humane by definition.&nbsp; But that man

<BR>was so in reality.&nbsp; His speech was not professional.

<BR>I was not ill.&nbsp; But other people were, and that was

<BR>the reason of his visiting the ship.



<P>He was the doctor of our Legation and, of course,

<BR>of the Consulate, too.&nbsp; He looked after the ship's

<BR>health, which generally was poor, and trembling,

<BR>as it were, on the verge of a break-up.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; The

<BR>men ailed.&nbsp; And thus time was not only money,

<BR>but life as well.



<P>I had never seen such a steady ship's company.

<BR>As the doctor remarked to me: "You seem to have

<BR>a most respectable lot of seamen."&nbsp; Not only were

<BR>they consistently sober, but they did not even

<BR>want to go ashore.&nbsp; Care was taken to expose

<BR>them as little as possible to the sun.&nbsp; They were

<BR>employed on light work under the awnings.&nbsp; And

<BR>the humane doctor commended me.



<P>"Your arrangements appear to me to be very

<BR>judicious, my dear Captain."



<P>It is difficult to express how much that pro-

<BR>nouncement comforted me.&nbsp; The doctor's round,

<BR>full face framed in a light-coloured whisker was the

<BR>perfection of a dignified amenity.&nbsp; He was the only

<BR>human being in the world who seemed to take the

<BR>slightest interest in me.&nbsp; He would generally sit in

<BR>the cabin for half an hour or so at every visit.



<P>I said to him one day:



<P>"I suppose the only thing now is to take care of

<BR>them as you are doing till I can get the ship to

<BR>sea?"



<P>He inclined his head, shutting his eyes under the

<BR>large spectacles, and murmured:



<P>"The sea . . . undoubtedly."



<P>The first member of the crew fairly knocked over

<BR>was the steward--the first man to whom I had

<BR>spoken on board.&nbsp; He was taken ashore (with

<BR>choleric symptoms) and died there at the end of a

<BR>week.&nbsp; Then, while I was still under the startling

<BR>impression of this first home-thrust of the climate,

<BR>Mr. Burns gave up and went to bed in a raging

<BR>fever without saying a word to anybody.



<P>I believe he had partly fretted himself into that

<BR>illness; the climate did the rest with the swiftness

<BR>of an invisible monster ambushed in the air, in the

<BR>water, in the mud of the river-bank.&nbsp; Mr. Burns

<BR>was a predestined victim.



<P>I discovered him lying on his back, glaring sul-

<BR>lenly and radiating heat on one like a small furnace.

<BR>He would hardly answer my questions, and only

<BR>grumbled.&nbsp; Couldn't a man take an afternoon off

<BR>duty with a bad headache--for once?



<P>That evening, as I sat in the saloon after dinner,

<BR>I could hear him muttering continuously in his

<BR>room.&nbsp; Ransome, who was clearing the table, said

<BR>to me:



<P>"I am afraid, sir, I won't be able to give the mate

<BR>all the attention he's likely to need.&nbsp; I will have

<BR>to be forward in the galley a great part of my

<BR>time."



<P>Ransome was the cook.&nbsp; The mate had pointed

<BR>him out to me the first day, standing on the deck,

<BR>his arms crossed on his broad chest, gazing on the

<BR>river.



<P>Even at a distance his well-proportioned figure,

<BR>something thoroughly sailor-like in his poise, made

<BR>him noticeable.&nbsp; On nearer view the intelligent,

<BR>quiet eyes, a well-bred face, the disciplined in-

<BR>dependence of his manner made up an attractive

<BR>personality.&nbsp; When, in addition, Mr. Burns told

<BR>me that he was the best seaman in the ship, I ex-

<BR>pressed my surprise that in his earliest prime and of

<BR>such appearance he should sign on as cook on board

<BR>a ship.



<P>"It's his heart," Mr. Burns had said.&nbsp; "There's

<BR>something wrong with it.&nbsp; He mustn't exert him-

<BR>self too much or he may drop dead suddenly."



<P>And he was the only one the climate had not

<BR>touched--perhaps because, carrying a deadly

<BR>enemy in his breast, he had schooled himself into a

<BR>systematic control of feelings and movements.

<BR>When one was in the secret this was apparent in his

<BR>manner.&nbsp; After the poor steward died, and as he

<BR>could not be replaced by a white man in this

<BR>Oriental port, Ransome had volunteered to do the

<BR>double work.



<P>"I can do it all right, sir, as long as I go about it

<BR>quietly," he had assured me.



<P>But obviously he couldn't be expected to take up

<BR>sick-nursing in addition.&nbsp; Moreover, the doctor

<BR>peremptorily ordered Mr. Burns ashore.



<P>With a seaman on each side holding him up

<BR>under the arms, the mate went over the gangway

<BR>more sullen than ever.&nbsp; We built him up with pil-

<BR>lows in the gharry, and he made an effort to say

<BR>brokenly:



<P>"Now--you've got--what you wanted--got me

<BR>out of--the ship."



<P>"You were never more mistaken in your life,

<BR>Mr. Burns," I said quietly, duly smiling at him;

<BR>and the trap drove off to a sort of sanatorium, a

<BR>pavilion of bricks which the doctor had in the

<BR>grounds of his residence.



<P>I visited Mr. Burns regularly.&nbsp; After the first

<BR>few days, when he didn't know anybody, he re-

<BR>ceived me as if I had come either to gloat over an

<BR>enemy or else to curry favour with a deeply

<BR>wronged person.&nbsp; It was either one or the other,

<BR>just as it happened according to his fantastic sick-

<BR>room moods.&nbsp; Whichever it was, he managed to

<BR>convey it to me even during the period when he ap-

<BR>peared almost too weak to talk.&nbsp; I treated him to

<BR>my invariable kindliness.



<P>Then one day, suddenly, a surge of downright

<BR>panic burst through all this craziness.



<P>If I left him behind in this deadly place he would

<BR>die.&nbsp; He felt it, he was certain of it.&nbsp; But I

<BR>wouldn't have the heart to leave him ashore.&nbsp; He

<BR>had a wife and child in Sydney.



<P>He produced his wasted forearms from under the

<BR>sheet which covered him and clasped his fleshless

<BR>claws.&nbsp; He would die!&nbsp; He would die here. . . .



<P>He absolutely managed to sit up, but only for a

<BR>moment, and when he fell back I really thought

<BR>that he would die there and then.&nbsp; I called to the

<BR>Bengali dispenser, and hastened away from the

<BR>room.



<P>Next day he upset me thoroughly by renewing

<BR>his entreaties.&nbsp; I returned an evasive answer, and

<BR>left him the picture of ghastly despair.&nbsp; The day

<BR>after I went in with reluctance, and he attacked me

<BR>at once in a much stronger voice and with an

<BR>abundance of argument which was quite startling.

<BR>He presented his case with a sort of crazy vigour,

<BR>and asked me finally how would I like to have a

<BR>man's death on my conscience?&nbsp; He wanted me to

<BR>promise that I would not sail without him.



<P>I said that I really must consult the doctor first.

<BR>He cried out at that.&nbsp; The doctor!&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; That

<BR>would be a death sentence.



<P>The effort had exhausted him.&nbsp; He closed his

<BR>eyes, but went on rambling in a low voice.&nbsp; I had

<BR>hated him from the start.&nbsp; The late captain had

<BR>hated him, too.&nbsp; Had wished him dead.&nbsp; Had

<BR>wished all hands dead. . . .



<P>"What do you want to stand in with that wicked

<BR>corpse for, sir?&nbsp; He'll have you, too," he ended,

<BR>blinking his glazed eyes vacantly.



<P>"Mr. Burns," I cried, very much discomposed,

<BR>"what on earth are you talking about?"



<P>He seemed to come to himself, though he was too

<BR>weak to start.



<P>"I don't know," he said languidly.&nbsp; "But don't

<BR>ask that doctor, sir.&nbsp; You are I are sailors.&nbsp; Don't

<BR>ask him, sir.&nbsp; Some day perhaps you will have a

<BR>wife and child yourself."



<P>And again he pleaded for the promise that I

<BR>would not leave him behind.&nbsp; I had the firmness of

<BR>mind not to give it to him.&nbsp; Afterward this stern-

<BR>ness seemed criminal; for my mind was made up.

<BR>That prostrated man, with hardly strength enough

<BR>to breathe and ravaged by a passion of fear, was

<BR>irresistible.&nbsp; And, besides, he had happened to hit

<BR>on the right words.&nbsp; He and I were sailors.&nbsp; That

<BR>was a claim, for I had no other family.&nbsp; As to the

<BR>wife and child (some day) argument, it had no force.

<BR>It sounded merely bizarre.



<P>I could imagine no claim that would be stronger

<BR>and more absorbing than the claim of that ship, of

<BR>these men snared in the river by silly commercial

<BR>complications, as if in some poisonous trap.



<P>However, I had nearly fought my way out.&nbsp; Out

<BR>to sea.&nbsp; The sea--which was pure, safe, and

<BR>friendly.&nbsp; Three days more.



<P>That thought sustained and carried me on my

<BR>way back to the ship.&nbsp; In the saloon the doctor's

<BR>voice greeted me, and his large form followed his

<BR>voice, issuing out of the starboard spare cabin

<BR>where the ship's medicine chest was kept securely

<BR>lashed in the bed-place.



<P>Finding that I was not on board he had gone in

<BR>there, he said, to inspect the supply of drugs,

<BR>bandages, and so on.&nbsp; Everything was completed

<BR>and in order.



<P>I thanked him; I had just been thinking of

<BR>asking him to do that very thing, as in a couple of

<BR>days, as he knew, we were going to sea, where

<BR>all our troubles of every sort would be over at

<BR>last.



<P>He listened gravely and made no answer.&nbsp; But

<BR>when I opened to him my mind as to Mr. Burns he

<BR>sat down by my side, and, laying his hand on my

<BR>knee amicably, begged me to think what it was I

<BR>was exposing myself to.



<P>The man was just strong enough to bear being

<BR>moved and no more.&nbsp; But he couldn't stand a re-

<BR>turn of the fever.&nbsp; I had before me a passage of

<BR>sixty days perhaps, beginning with intricate navi-

<BR>gation and ending probably with a lot of bad

<BR>weather.&nbsp; Could I run the risk of having to go

<BR>through it single-handed, with no chief officer and

<BR>with a second quite a youth? . . .



<P>He might have added that it was my first com-

<BR>mand, too.&nbsp; He did probably think of that fact, for he

<BR>checked himself.&nbsp; It was very present to my mind.



<P>He advised me earnestly to cable to Singapore

<BR>for a chief officer, even if I had to delay my sailing

<BR>for a week.



<P>"Never," I said.&nbsp; The very thought gave me the

<BR>shivers.&nbsp; The hands seemed fairly fit, all of them,

<BR>and this was the time to get them away.&nbsp; Once at

<BR>sea I was not afraid of facing anything.&nbsp; The sea

<BR>was now the only remedy for all my troubles.



<P>The doctor's glasses were directed at me like two

<BR>lamps searching the genuineness of my resolution.

<BR>He opened his lips as if to argue further, but shut

<BR>them again without saying anything.&nbsp; I had a

<BR>vision so vivid of poor Burns in his exhaustion,

<BR>helplessness, and anguish, that it moved me more

<BR>than the reality I had come away from only an

<BR>hour before.&nbsp; It was purged from the drawbacks of

<BR>his personality, and I could not resist it.



<P>"Look here," I said.&nbsp; "Unless you tell me

<BR>officially that the man must not be moved I'll make

<BR>arrangements to have him brought on board to-

<BR>morrow, and shall take the ship out of the river

<BR>next morning, even if I have to anchor outside the

<BR>bar for a couple of days to get her ready for sea."



<P>"Oh!&nbsp; I'll make all the arrangements myself,"

<BR>said the doctor at once.&nbsp; "I spoke as I did only as a

<BR>friend--as a well-wisher, and that sort of thing."



<P>He rose in his dignified simplicity and gave me a

<BR>warm handshake, rather solemnly, I thought.&nbsp; But

<BR>he was as good as his word.&nbsp; When Mr. Burns ap-

<BR>peared at the gangway carried on a stretcher, the

<BR>doctor himself walked by its side.&nbsp; The programme

<BR>had been altered in so far that this transportation

<BR>had been left to the last moment, on the very morn-

<BR>ing of our departure.



<P>It was barely an hour after sunrise.&nbsp; The doctor

<BR>waved his big arm to me from the shore and walked

<BR>back at once to his trap, which had followed him

<BR>empty to the river-side.&nbsp; Mr. Burns, carried across

<BR>the quarter-deck, had the appearance of being

<BR>absolutely lifeless.&nbsp; Ransome went down to settle

<BR>him in his cabin.&nbsp; I had to remain on deck to look

<BR>after the ship, for the tug had got hold of our tow-

<BR>rope already.



<P>The splash of our shore-fasts falling in the water

<BR>produced a complete change of feeling in me.&nbsp; It

<BR>was like the imperfect relief of awakening from a

<BR>nightmare.&nbsp; But when the ship's head swung down

<BR>the river away from that town, Oriental and

<BR>squalid, I missed the expected elation of that

<BR>striven-for moment.&nbsp; What there was, un-

<BR>doubtedly, was a relaxation of tension which trans-

<BR>lated itself into a sense of weariness after an in-

<BR>glorious fight.



<P>About midday we anchored a mile outside the

<BR>bar.&nbsp; The afternoon was busy for all hands.

<BR>Watching the work from the poop, where I re-

<BR>mained all the time, I detected in it some of the

<BR>languor of the six weeks spent in the steaming heat

<BR>of the river.&nbsp; The first breeze would blow that

<BR>away.&nbsp; Now the calm was complete.&nbsp; I judged

<BR>that the second officer--a callow youth with an

<BR>unpromising face--was not, to put it mildly, of that

<BR>invaluable stuff from which a commander's right

<BR>hand is made.&nbsp; But I was glad to catch along the

<BR>main deck a few smiles on those seamen's faces at

<BR>which I had hardly had time to have a good look as

<BR>yet.&nbsp; Having thrown off the mortal coil of shore

<BR>affairs, I felt myself familiar with them and yet a

<BR>little strange, like a long-lost wanderer among his

<BR>kin.



<P>Ransome flitted continually to and fro between

<BR>the galley and the cabin.&nbsp; It was a pleasure to

<BR>look at him.&nbsp; The man positively had grace.&nbsp; He

<BR>alone of all the crew had not had a day's illness in

<BR>port.&nbsp; But with the knowledge of that uneasy

<BR>heart within his breast I could detect the restraint

<BR>he put on the natural sailor-like agility of his

<BR>movements.&nbsp; It was as though he had something

<BR>very fragile or very explosive to carry about his

<BR>person and was all the time aware of it.



<P>I had occasion to address him once or twice.&nbsp; He

<BR>answered me in his pleasant, quiet voice and with a

<BR>faint, slightly wistful smile.&nbsp; Mr. Burns appeared

<BR>to be resting.&nbsp; He seemed fairly comfortable.



<P>After sunset I came out on deck again to meet

<BR>only a still void.&nbsp; The thin, featureless crust of the

<BR>coast could not be distinguished.&nbsp; The darkness

<BR>had risen around the ship like a mysterious emana-

<BR>tion from the dumb and lonely waters.&nbsp; I leaned

<BR>on the rail and turned my ear to the shadows of the

<BR>night.&nbsp; Not a sound.&nbsp; My command might have

<BR>been a planet flying vertiginously on its appointed

<BR>path in a space of infinite silence.&nbsp; I clung to the

<BR>rail as if my sense of balance were leaving me for

<BR>good.&nbsp; How absurd.&nbsp; I failed nervously.



<P>"On deck there!"



<P>The immediate answer, "Yes, sir," broke the

<BR>spell.&nbsp; The anchor-watch man ran up the poop

<BR>ladder smartly.&nbsp; I told him to report at once the

<BR>slightest sign of a breeze coming.



<P>Going below I looked in on Mr. Burns.&nbsp; In fact,

<BR>I could not avoid seeing him, for his door stood

<BR>open.&nbsp; The man was so wasted that, in this white

<BR>cabin, under a white sheet, and with his diminished

<BR>head sunk in the white pillow, his red moustaches

<BR>captured their eyes exclusively, like something arti-

<BR>ficial--a pair of moustaches from a shop exhibited

<BR>there in the harsh light of the bulkhead-lamp

<BR>without a shade.



<P>While I stared with a sort of wonder he asserted

<BR>himself by opening his eyes and even moving them

<BR>in my direction.&nbsp; A minute stir.



<P>"Dead calm, Mr. Burns," I said resignedly.



<P>In an unexpectedly distinct voice Mr. Burns be-

<BR>gan a rambling speech.&nbsp; Its tone was very strange,

<BR>not as if affected by his illness, but as if of a differ-

<BR>ent nature.&nbsp; It sounded unearthly.&nbsp; As to the

<BR>matter, I seemed to make out that it was the fault

<BR>of the "old man"--the late captain--ambushed

<BR>down there under the sea with some evil intention.

<BR>It was a weird story.



<P>I listened to the end; then stepping into the

<BR>cabin I laid my hand on the mate's forehead.&nbsp; It

<BR>was cool.&nbsp; He was light-headed only from extreme

<BR>weakness.&nbsp; Suddenly he seemed to become aware

<BR>of me, and in his own voice--of course, very feeble

<BR>--he asked regretfully:



<P>"Is there no chance at all to get under way, sir?"



<P>"What's the good of letting go our hold of the

<BR>ground only to drift, Mr. Burns?" I answered.



<P>He sighed and I left him to his immobility.&nbsp; His

<BR>hold on life was as slender as his hold on sanity.&nbsp; I

<BR>was oppressed by my lonely responsibilities.&nbsp; I

<BR>went into my cabin to seek relief in a few hours'

<BR>sleep, but almost before I closed my eyes the man

<BR>on deck came down reporting a light breeze.

<BR>Enough to get under way with, he said.



<P>And it was no more than just enough.&nbsp; I ordered

<BR>the windlass manned, the sails loosed, and the top-

<BR>sails set.&nbsp; But by the time I had cast the ship I

<BR>could hardly feel any breath of wind.&nbsp; Neverthe-

<BR>less, I trimmed the yards and put everything on

<BR>her.&nbsp; I was not going to give up the attempt.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>HE SHOOK hands with me: "Well, there you are, on

<BR>your own, appointed officially under my re-

<BR>sponsibility."



<P>He was actually walking with me to the door.

<BR>What a distance off it seemed!&nbsp; I moved like a

<BR>man in bonds.&nbsp; But we reached it at last.&nbsp; I opened

<BR>it with the sensation of dealing with mere dream-

<BR>stuff, and then at the last moment the fellowship

<BR>of seamen asserted itself, stronger than the differ-

<BR>ence of age and station.&nbsp; It asserted itself in

<BR>Captain Ellis' voice.



<P>"Good-bye--and good luck to you," he said so

<BR>heartily that I could only give him a grateful

<BR>glance.&nbsp; Then I turned and went out, never to see

<BR>him again in my life.&nbsp; I had not made three steps

<BR>into the outer office when I heard behind my back

<BR>a gruff, loud, authoritative voice, the voice of our

<BR>deputy-Neptune.



<P>It was addressing the head Shipping-Master

<BR>who, having let me in, had, apparently, remained

<BR>hovering in the middle distance ever since

<BR>"Mr. R., let the harbour launch have steam up to

<BR>take the captain here on board the Melita at half-

<BR>past nine to-night."



<P>I was amazed at the startled alacrity of R's

<BR>"Yes, sir."&nbsp; He ran before me out on the landing.

<BR>My new dignity sat yet so lightly on me that I was

<BR>not aware that it was I, the Captain, the object of

<BR>this last graciousness.&nbsp; It seemed as if all of a sud-

<BR>den a pair of wings had grown on my shoulders.&nbsp; I

<BR>merely skimmed along the polished floor.



<P>But R. was impressed.



<P>"I say!" he exclaimed on the landing, while the

<BR>Malay crew of the steam-launch standing by looked

<BR>stonily at the man for whom they were going to be

<BR>kept on duty so late, away from their gambling,

<BR>from their girls, or their pure domestic joys.&nbsp; "I

<BR>say!&nbsp; His own launch.&nbsp; What have you done to

<BR>him?"



<P>His stare was full of respectful curiosity.&nbsp; I was

<BR>quite confounded.



<P>"Was it for me?&nbsp; I hadn't the slightest notion,"

<BR>I stammered out.



<P>He nodded many times.&nbsp; "Yes.&nbsp; And the last

<BR>person who had it before you was a Duke.&nbsp; So,

<BR>there!"



<P>I think he expected me to faint on the spot.

<BR>But I was in too much of a hurry for emotional

<BR>displays.&nbsp; My feelings were already in such a whirl

<BR>that this staggering information did not seem to

<BR>make the slightest difference.&nbsp; It merely fell into

<BR>the seething cauldron of my brain, and I carried it

<BR>off with me after a short but effusive passage of

<BR>leave-taking with R.



<P>The favour of the great throws an aureole round

<BR>the fortunate object of its selection.&nbsp; That ex-

<BR>cellent man enquired whether he could do anything

<BR>for me.&nbsp; He had known me only by sight, and he

<BR>was well aware he would never see me again; I was,

<BR>in common with the other seamen of the port,

<BR>merely a subject for official writing, filling up of

<BR>forms with all the artificial superiority of a man of

<BR>pen and ink to the men who grapple with realities

<BR>outside the consecrated walls of official buildings.

<BR>What ghosts we must have been to him!&nbsp; Mere

<BR>symbols to juggle with in books and heavy

<BR>registers, without brains and muscles and per-

<BR>plexities; something hardly useful and decidedly

<BR>inferior.



<P>And he--the office hours being over--wanted to

<BR>know if he could be of any use to me!



<P>I ought--properly speaking--I ought to have

<BR>been moved to tears.&nbsp; But I did not even think of it.

<BR>It was merely another miraculous manifestation of

<BR>that day of miracles.&nbsp; I parted from him as if he

<BR>were a mere symbol.&nbsp; I floated down the staircase.

<BR>I floated out of the official and imposing portal.&nbsp; I

<BR>went on floating along.



<P>I use that word rather than the word "flew," be-

<BR>cause I have a distinct impression that, though up-

<BR>lifted by my aroused youth, my movements were

<BR>deliberate enough.&nbsp; To that mixed white, brown,

<BR>and yellow portion of mankind, out abroad on their

<BR>own affairs, I presented the appearance of a man

<BR>walking rather sedately.&nbsp; And nothing in the way

<BR>of abstraction could have equalled my deep de-

<BR>tachment from the forms and colours of this world.

<BR>It was, as it were, final.



<P>And yet, suddenly, I recognized Hamilton.&nbsp; I

<BR>recognized him without effort, without a shock,

<BR>without a start.&nbsp; There he was, strolling toward

<BR>the Harbour Office with his stiff, arrogant dignity.

<BR>His red face made him noticeable at a distance.&nbsp; It

<BR>flamed, over there, on the shady side of the street.



<P>He had perceived me, too.&nbsp; Something (uncon-

<BR>scious exuberance of spirits perhaps) moved me to

<BR>wave my hand to him elaborately.&nbsp; This lapse

<BR>from good taste happened before I was aware that

<BR>I was capable of it.



<P>The impact of my impudence stopped him short,

<BR>much as a bullet might have done.&nbsp; I verily believe

<BR>he staggered, though as far as I could see he didn't

<BR>actually fall.&nbsp; I had gone past in a moment and did

<BR>not turn my head.&nbsp; I had forgotten his existence.



<P>The next ten minutes might have been ten

<BR>seconds or ten centuries for all my consciousness

<BR>had to do with it.&nbsp; People might have been falling

<BR>dead around me, houses crumbling, guns firing,

<BR>I wouldn't have known.&nbsp; I was thinking: "By

<BR>Jove!&nbsp; I have got it."&nbsp; IT being the command.&nbsp; It

<BR>had come about in a way utterly unforeseen in my

<BR>modest day-dreams.



<P>I perceived that my imagination had been run-

<BR>ning in conventional channels and that my hopes

<BR>had always been drab stuff.&nbsp; I had envisaged a

<BR>command as a result of a slow course of promotion

<BR>in the employ of some highly respectable firm.

<BR>The reward of faithful service.&nbsp; Well, faithful

<BR>service was all right.&nbsp; One would naturally give

<BR>that for one's own sake, for the sake of the ship,

<BR>for the love of the life of one's choice; not for the

<BR>sake of the reward.



<P>There is something distasteful in the notion of a

<BR>reward.



<P>And now here I had my command, absolutely in

<BR>my pocket, in a way undeniable indeed, but most

<BR>unexpected; beyond my imaginings, outside all

<BR>reasonable expectations, and even notwithstanding

<BR>the existence of some sort of obscure intrigue to

<BR>keep it away from me.&nbsp; It is true that the intrigue

<BR>was feeble, but it helped the feeling of wonder--as

<BR>if I had been specially destined for that ship I did

<BR>not know, by some power higher than the prosaic

<BR>agencies of the commercial world.



<P>A strange sense of exultation began to creep into

<BR>me.&nbsp; If I had worked for that command ten years

<BR>or more there would have been nothing of the kind.

<BR>I was a little frightened.



<P>"Let us be calm," I said to myself.



<P>Outside the door of the Officers' Home the

<BR>wretched Steward seemed to be waiting for me.

<BR>There was a broad flight of a few steps, and he ran

<BR>to and fro on the top of it as if chained there.&nbsp; A

<BR>distressed cur.&nbsp; He looked as though his throat

<BR>were too dry for him to bark.



<P>I regret to say I stopped before going in.&nbsp; There

<BR>had been a revolution in my moral nature.&nbsp; He

<BR>waited open-mouthed, breathless, while I looked

<BR>at him for half a minute.



<P>"And you thought you could keep me out of it,"

<BR>I said scathingly.



<P>"You said you were going home," he squeaked

<BR>miserably.&nbsp; "You said so.&nbsp; You said so."



<P>"I wonder what Captain Ellis will have to say

<BR>to that excuse," I uttered slowly with a sinister

<BR>meaning.



<P>His lower jaw had been trembling all the time and

<BR>his voice was like the bleating of a sick goat.&nbsp; "You

<BR>have given me away?&nbsp; You have done for me?"



<P>Neither his distress nor yet the sheer absurdity

<BR>of it was able to disarm me.&nbsp; It was the first in-

<BR>stance of harm being attempted to be done to me

<BR>--at any rate, the first I had ever found out.&nbsp; And

<BR>I was still young enough, still too much on this side

<BR>of the shadow line, not to be surprised and indig-

<BR>nant at such things.



<P>I gazed at him inflexibly.&nbsp; Let the beggar suffer.

<BR>He slapped his forehead and I passed in, pursued,

<BR>into the dining room, by his screech: "I always

<BR>said you'd be the death of me."



<P>This clamour not only overtook me, but went

<BR>ahead as it were on to the verandah and brought

<BR>out Captain Giles.



<P>He stood before me in the doorway in all the

<BR>commonplace solidity of his wisdom.&nbsp; The gold

<BR>chain glittered on his breast.&nbsp; He clutched a

<BR>smouldering pipe.



<P>I extended my hand to him warmly and he

<BR>seemed surprised, but did respond heartily enough

<BR>in the end, with a faint smile of superior knowledge

<BR>which cut my thanks short as if with a knife.&nbsp; I

<BR>don't think that more than one word came out.

<BR>And even for that one, judging by the temperature

<BR>of my face, I had blushed as if for a bad action.

<BR>Assuming a detached tone, I wondered how on

<BR>earth he had managed to spot the little underhand

<BR>game that had been going on.



<P>He murmured complacently that there were but

<BR>few things done in the town that he could not see

<BR>the inside of.&nbsp; And as to this house, he had been

<BR>using it off and on for nearly ten years.&nbsp; Nothing

<BR>that went on in it could escape his great experience.

<BR>It had been no trouble to him.&nbsp; No trouble at all.



<P>Then in his quiet, thick tone he wanted to know

<BR>if I had complained formally of the Steward's

<BR>action.



<P>I said that I hadn't--though, indeed, it was not

<BR>for want of opportunity.&nbsp; Captain Ellis had gone

<BR>for me bald-headed in a most ridiculous fashion for

<BR>being out of the way when wanted.



<P>"Funny old gentleman," interjected Captain

<BR>Giles.&nbsp; "What did you say to that?"



<P>"I said simply that I came along the very mo-

<BR>ment I heard of his message.&nbsp; Nothing more.&nbsp; I

<BR>didn't want to hurt the Steward.&nbsp; I would scorn

<BR>to harm such an object.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I made no com-

<BR>plaint, but I believe he thinks I've done so.&nbsp; Let

<BR>him think.&nbsp; He's got a fright he won't forget in a

<BR>hurry, for Captain Ellis would kick him out into

<BR>the middle of Asia. . . ."



<P>"Wait a moment," said Captain Giles, leaving

<BR>me suddenly.&nbsp; I sat down feeling very tired,

<BR>mostly in my head.&nbsp; Before I could start a train of

<BR>thought he stood again before me, murmuring the

<BR>excuse that he had to go and put the fellow's mind

<BR>at ease.



<P>I looked up with surprise.&nbsp; But in reality I was

<BR>indifferent.&nbsp; He explained that he had found the

<BR>Steward lying face downward on the horsehair sofa.

<BR>He was all right now.



<P>"He would not have died of fright," I said con-

<BR>temptuously.



<P>"No.&nbsp; But he might have taken an overdose out

<BR>of one of them little bottles he keeps in his room,"

<BR>Captain Giles argued seriously.&nbsp; "The confounded

<BR>fool has tried to poison himself once--a few years

<BR>ago."



<P>"Really," I said without emotion.&nbsp; "He doesn't

<BR>seem very fit to live, anyhow."



<P>"As to that, it may be said of a good many."



<P>"Don't exaggerate like this!" I protested,

<BR>laughing irritably.&nbsp; "But I wonder what this part

<BR>of the world would do if you were to leave off look-

<BR>ing after it, Captain Giles?&nbsp; Here you have got me

<BR>a command and saved the Steward's life in one

<BR>afternoon.&nbsp; Though why you should have taken all

<BR>that interest in either of us is more than I can

<BR>understand."



<P>Captain Giles remained silent for a minute.

<BR>Then gravely:



<P>"He's not a bad steward really.&nbsp; He can find a

<BR>good cook, at any rate.&nbsp; And, what's more, he can

<BR>keep him when found.&nbsp; I remember the cooks we

<BR>had here before his time! . . ."



<P>I must have made a movement of impatience,

<BR>because he interrupted himself with an apology for

<BR>keeping me yarning there, while no doubt I needed

<BR>all my time to get ready.



<P>What I really needed was to be alone for a bit.

<BR>I seized this opening hastily.&nbsp; My bedroom was a

<BR>quiet refuge in an apparently uninhabited wing of

<BR>the building.&nbsp; Having absolutely nothing to do

<BR>(for I had not unpacked my things), I sat down on

<BR>the bed and abandoned myself to the influences of

<BR>the hour.&nbsp; To the unexpected influences. . . .



<P>And first I wondered at my state of mind.&nbsp; Why

<BR>was I not more surprised?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Here I was, in-

<BR>vested with a command in the twinkling of an eye,

<BR>not in the common course of human affairs, but

<BR>more as if by enchantment.&nbsp; I ought to have been

<BR>lost in astonishment.&nbsp; But I wasn't.&nbsp; I was very

<BR>much like people in fairy tales.&nbsp; Nothing ever

<BR>astonishes them.&nbsp; When a fully appointed gala

<BR>coach is produced out of a pumpkin to take

<BR>her to a ball, Cinderella does not exclaim.&nbsp; She

<BR>gets in quietly and drives away to her high for-

<BR>tune.



<P>Captain Ellis (a fierce sort of fairy) had pro-

<BR>duced a command out of a drawer almost as un-

<BR>expectedly as in a fairy tale.&nbsp; But a command is an

<BR>abstract idea, and it seemed a sort of "lesser

<BR>marvel" till it flashed upon me that it involved the

<BR>concrete existence of a ship.



<P>A ship!&nbsp; My ship!&nbsp; She was mine, more abso-

<BR>lutely mine for possession and care than anything

<BR>in the world; an object of responsibility and de-

<BR>votion.&nbsp; She was there waiting for me, spell-bound,

<BR>unable to move, to live, to get out into the world

<BR>(till I came), like an enchanted princess.&nbsp; Her call

<BR>had come to me as if from the clouds.&nbsp; I had never

<BR>suspected her existence.&nbsp; I didn't know how she

<BR>looked, I had barely heard her name, and yet we

<BR>were indissolubly united for a certain portion of our

<BR>future, to sink or swim together!



<P>A sudden passion of anxious impatience rushed

<BR>through my veins, gave me such a sense of the in-

<BR>tensity of existence as I have never felt before or

<BR>since.&nbsp; I discovered how much of a seaman I was,

<BR>in heart, in mind, and, as it were, physically--a

<BR>man exclusively of sea and ships; the sea the only

<BR>world that counted, and the ships, the test of man-

<BR>liness, of temperament, of courage and fidelity--

<BR>and of love.



<P>I had an exquisite moment.&nbsp; It was unique also.

<BR>Jumping up from my seat, I paced up and down

<BR>my room for a long time.&nbsp; But when I came down-

<BR>stairs I behaved with sufficient composure.&nbsp; I

<BR>only couldn't eat anything at dinner.



<P>Having declared my intention not to drive but

<BR>to walk down to the quay, I must render the

<BR>wretched Steward justice that he bestirred himself

<BR>to find me some coolies for the luggage.&nbsp; They de-

<BR>parted, carrying all my worldly possessions (except

<BR>a little money I had in my pocket) slung from a long

<BR>pole.&nbsp; Captain Giles volunteered to walk down

<BR>with me.



<P>We followed the sombre, shaded alley across the

<BR>Esplanade.&nbsp; It was moderately cool there under

<BR>the trees.&nbsp; Captain Giles remarked, with a sudden

<BR>laugh: "I know who's jolly thankful at having seen

<BR>the last of you."



<P>I guessed that he meant the Steward.&nbsp; The fellow

<BR>had borne himself to me in a sulkily frightened

<BR>manner at the last.&nbsp; I expressed my wonder that

<BR>he should have tried to do me a bad turn for no

<BR>reason at all.



<P>"Don't you see that what he wanted was to get

<BR>rid of our friend Hamilton by dodging him in front

<BR>of you for that job?&nbsp; That would have removed

<BR>him for good.&nbsp; See?"



<P>"Heavens!" I exclaimed, feeling humiliated

<BR>somehow.&nbsp; "Can it be possible?&nbsp; What a fool he

<BR>must be!&nbsp; That overbearing, impudent loafer!

<BR>Why!&nbsp; He couldn't. . . .&nbsp; And yet he's nearly

<BR>done it, I believe; for the Harbour Office was bound

<BR>to send somebody."



<P>"Aye.&nbsp; A fool like our Steward can be dangerous

<BR>sometimes," declared Captain Giles sententiously.

<BR>"Just because he is a fool," he added, imparting

<BR>further instruction in his complacent low tones.

<BR>"For," he continued in the manner of a set demon-

<BR>stration, "no sensible person would risk being

<BR>kicked out of the only berth between himself and

<BR>starvation just to get rid of a simple annoyance--

<BR>a small worry.&nbsp; Would he now?"



<P>"Well, no," I conceded, restraining a desire to

<BR>laugh at that something mysteriously earnest in

<BR>delivering the conclusions of his wisdom as though

<BR>it were the product of prohibited operations.&nbsp; "But

<BR>that fellow looks as if he were rather crazy.&nbsp; He

<BR>must be."



<P>"As to that, I believe everybody in the world is a

<BR>little mad," he announced quietly.



<P>"You make no exceptions?" I inquired, just to

<BR>hear his manner.



<P>"Why!&nbsp; Kent says that even of you."



<P>"Does he?" I retorted, extremely embittered

<BR>all at once against my former captain.&nbsp; "There's

<BR>nothing of that in the written character from him

<BR>which I've got in my pocket.&nbsp; Has he given you

<BR>any instances of my lunacy?"



<P>Captain Giles explained in a conciliating tone

<BR>that it had been only a friendly remark in refer-

<BR>ence to my abrupt leaving the ship for no apparent

<BR>reason.



<P>I muttered grumpily: "Oh! leaving his ship,"

<BR>and mended my pace.&nbsp; He kept up by my side in

<BR>the deep gloom of the avenue as if it were his con-

<BR>scientious duty to see me out of the colony as an

<BR>undesirable character.&nbsp; He panted a little, which

<BR>was rather pathetic in a way.&nbsp; But I was not

<BR>moved.&nbsp; On the contrary.&nbsp; His discomfort gave

<BR>me a sort of malicious pleasure.



<P>Presently I relented, slowed down, and said:



<P>"What I really wanted was to get a fresh grip.

<BR>I felt it was time.&nbsp; Is that so very mad?"



<P>He made no answer.&nbsp; We were issuing from the

<BR>avenue.&nbsp; On the bridge over the canal a dark, ir-

<BR>resolute figure seemed to be awaiting something or

<BR>somebody.



<P>It was a Malay policeman, barefooted, in his

<BR>blue uniform.&nbsp; The silver band on his little round

<BR>cap shone dimly in the light of the street lamp.&nbsp; He

<BR>peered in our direction timidly.



<P>Before we could come up to him he turned about

<BR>and walked in front of us in the direction of the

<BR>jetty.&nbsp; The distance was some hundred yards; and

<BR>then I found my coolies squatting on their heels.

<BR>They had kept the pole on their shoulders, and all

<BR>my worldly goods, still tied to the pole, were resting

<BR>on the ground between them.&nbsp; As far as the eye

<BR>could reach along the quay there was not another

<BR>soul abroad except the police peon, who saluted us.



<P>It seems he had detained the coolies as suspicious

<BR>characters, and had forbidden them the jetty.&nbsp; But

<BR>at a sign from me he took off the embargo with

<BR>alacrity.&nbsp; The two patient fellows, rising together

<BR>with a faint grunt, trotted off along the planks, and

<BR>I prepared to take my leave of Captain Giles, who

<BR>stood there with an air as though his mission were

<BR>drawing to a close.&nbsp; It could not be denied that he

<BR>had done it all.&nbsp; And while I hesitated about an

<BR>appropriate sentence he made himself heard:



<P>"I expect you'll have your hands pretty full of

<BR>tangled-up business."



<P>I asked him what made him think so; and he an-

<BR>swered that it was his general experience of the

<BR>world.&nbsp; Ship a long time away from her port,

<BR>owners inaccessible by cable, and the only man who

<BR>could explain matters dead and buried.



<P>"And you yourself new to the business in a way,"

<BR>he concluded in a sort of unanswerable tone.



<P>"Don't insist," I said.&nbsp; "I know it only too well.

<BR>I only wish you could impart to me some small

<BR>portion of your experience before I go.&nbsp; As it can't

<BR>be done in ten minutes I had better not begin to ask

<BR>you.&nbsp; There's that harbour launch waiting for me,

<BR>too.&nbsp; But I won't feel really at peace till I have that

<BR>ship of mine out in the Indian Ocean."



<P>He remarked casually that from Bangkok to the

<BR>Indian Ocean was a pretty long step.&nbsp; And this

<BR>murmur, like a dim flash from a dark lantern,

<BR>showed me for a moment the broad belt of islands

<BR>and reefs between that unknown ship, which was

<BR>mine, and the freedom of the great waters of the

<BR>globe.



<P>But I felt no apprehension.&nbsp; I was familiar

<BR>enough with the Archipelago by that time.&nbsp; Ex-

<BR>treme patience and extreme care would see me

<BR>through the region of broken land, of faint airs, and

<BR>of dead water to where I would feel at last my

<BR>command swing on the great swell and list over to

<BR>the great breath of regular winds, that would give

<BR>her the feeling of a large, more intense life.&nbsp; The

<BR>road would be long.&nbsp; All roads are long that lead

<BR>toward one's heart's desire.&nbsp; But this road my

<BR>mind's eye could see on a chart, professionally,

<BR>with all its complications and difficulties, yet simple

<BR>enough in a way.&nbsp; One is a seaman or one is not.

<BR>And I had no doubt of being one.



<P>The only part I was a stranger to was the Gulf of

<BR>Siam.&nbsp; And I mentioned this to Captain Giles.

<BR>Not that I was concerned very much.&nbsp; It belonged

<BR>to the same region the nature of which I knew, into

<BR>whose very soul I seemed to have looked during the

<BR>last months of that existence with which I had

<BR>broken now, suddenly, as one parts with some en-

<BR>chanting company.



<P>"The gulf . . . Ay!&nbsp; A funny piece of

<BR>water--that," said Captain Giles.



<P>Funny, in this connection, was a vague word.

<BR>The whole thing sounded like an opinion uttered

<BR>by a cautious person mindful of actions for slander.



<P>I didn't inquire as to the nature of that funni-

<BR>ness.&nbsp; There was really no time.&nbsp; But at the very

<BR>last he volunteered a warning.



<P>"Whatever you do keep to the east side of it.

<BR>The west side is dangerous at this time of the year.

<BR>Don't let anything tempt you over.&nbsp; You'll find

<BR>nothing but trouble there."



<P>Though I could hardly imagine what could tempt

<BR>me to involve my ship amongst the currents and

<BR>reefs of the Malay shore, I thanked him for the

<BR>advice.



<P>He gripped my extended arm warmly, and the

<BR>end of our acquaintance came suddenly in the

<BR>words: "Good-night."



<P>That was all he said: "Good-night."&nbsp; Nothing

<BR>more.&nbsp; I don't know what I intended to say, but

<BR>surprise made me swallow it, whatever it was.&nbsp; I

<BR>choked slightly, and then exclaimed with a sort of

<BR>nervous haste: "Oh!&nbsp; Good-night, Captain Giles,

<BR>good-night."



<P>His movements were always deliberate, but his

<BR>back had receded some distance along the deserted

<BR>quay before I collected myself enough to follow his

<BR>example and made a half turn in the direction of

<BR>the jetty.



<P>Only my movements were not deliberate.&nbsp; I

<BR>hurried down to the steps, and leaped into the

<BR>launch.&nbsp; Before I had fairly landed in her stern-

<BR>sheets the slim little craft darted away from the

<BR>jetty with a sudden swirl of her propeller and the

<BR>hard, rapid puffing of the exhaust in her vaguely

<BR>gleaming brass funnel amidships.



<P>The misty churning at her stern was the only

<BR>sound in the world.&nbsp; The shore lay plunged in the

<BR>silence of the deeper slumber.&nbsp; I watched the town

<BR>recede still and soundless in the hot night, till the

<BR>abrupt hail, "Steam-launch, ahoy!" made me spin

<BR>round face forward.&nbsp; We were close to a white

<BR>ghostly steamer.&nbsp; Lights shone on her decks, in her

<BR>portholes.&nbsp; And the same voice shouted from her:



<P>"Is that our passenger?"



<P>"It is," I yelled.



<P>Her crew had been obviously on the jump.&nbsp; I

<BR>could hear them running about.&nbsp; The modern

<BR>spirit of haste was loudly vocal in the orders to

<BR>"Heave away on the cable"--to "Lower the side-

<BR>ladder," and in urgent requests to me to "Come

<BR>along, sir!&nbsp; We have been delayed three hours for

<BR>you. . . .&nbsp; Our time is seven o'clock, you know!"



<P>I stepped on the deck.&nbsp; I said "No!&nbsp; I don't

<BR>know."&nbsp; The spirit of modern hurry was embodied

<BR>in a thin, long-armed, long-legged man, with a

<BR>closely clipped gray beard.&nbsp; His meagre hand was

<BR>hot and dry.&nbsp; He declared feverishly:



<P>"I am hanged if I would have waited another

<BR>five minutes Harbour-Master or no Harbour-

<BR>Master."



<P>"That's your own business," I said.&nbsp; "I didn't

<BR>ask you to wait for me."



<P>"I hope you don't expect any supper," he burst

<BR>out.&nbsp; "This isn't a boarding-house afloat.&nbsp; You are

<BR>the first passenger I ever had in my life and I hope

<BR>to goodness you will be the last."



<P>I made no answer to this hospitable communi-

<BR>cation; and, indeed, he didn't wait for any, bolting

<BR>away on to his bridge to get his ship under way.



<P>For the three days he had me on board he did not

<BR>depart from that half-hostile attitude.&nbsp; His ship

<BR>having been delayed three hours on my account he

<BR>couldn't forgive me for not being a more distin-

<BR>guished person.&nbsp; He was not exactly outspoken

<BR>about it, but that feeling of annoyed wonder was

<BR>peeping out perpetually in his talk.



<P>He was absurd.



<P>He was also a man of much experience, which he

<BR>liked to trot out; but no greater contrast with Cap-

<BR>tain Giles could have been imagined.&nbsp; He would

<BR>have amused me if I had wanted to be amused.

<BR>But I did not want to be amused.&nbsp; I was like a

<BR>lover looking forward to a meeting.&nbsp; Human hos-

<BR>tility was nothing to me.&nbsp; I thought of my un-

<BR>known ship.&nbsp; It was amusement enough, torment

<BR>enough, occupation enough.



<P>He perceived my state, for his wits were suffi-

<BR>ciently sharp for that, and he poked sly fun at my

<BR>preoccupation in the manner some nasty, cynical

<BR>old men assume toward the dreams and illusions of

<BR>youth.&nbsp; I, on my side, refrained from questioning

<BR>him as to the appearance of my ship, though I

<BR>knew that being in Bangkok every fortnight or so he

<BR>must have known her by sight.&nbsp; I was not going to

<BR>expose the ship, my ship! to some slighting

<BR>reference.



<P>He was the first really unsympathetic man I had

<BR>ever come in contact with.&nbsp; My education was far

<BR>from being finished, though I didn't know it.&nbsp; No!

<BR>I didn't know it.



<P>All I knew was that he disliked me and had some

<BR>contempt for my person.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Apparently

<BR>because his ship had been delayed three hours on

<BR>my account.&nbsp; Who was I to have such a thing done

<BR>for me?&nbsp; Such a thing had never been done for him.

<BR>It was a sort of jealous indignation.



<P>My expectation, mingled with fear, was wrought

<BR>to its highest pitch.&nbsp; How slow had been the days

<BR>of the passage and how soon they were over.&nbsp; One

<BR>morning, early, we crossed the bar, and while the

<BR>sun was rising splendidly over the flat spaces of the

<BR>land we steamed up the innumerable bends, passed

<BR>under the shadow of the great gilt pagoda, and

<BR>reached the outskirts of the town.



<P>There it was, spread largely on both banks, the

<BR>Oriental capital which had as yet suffered no white

<BR>conqueror; an expanse of brown houses of bamboo,

<BR>of mats, of leaves, of a vegetable-matter style of

<BR>architecture, sprung out of the brown soil on the

<BR>banks of the muddy river.&nbsp; It was amazing to think

<BR>that in those miles of human habitations there was

<BR>not probably half a dozen pounds of nails.&nbsp; Some

<BR>of those houses of sticks and grass, like the nests of

<BR>an aquatic race, clung to the low shores.&nbsp; Others

<BR>seemed to grow out of the water; others again

<BR>floated in long anchored rows in the very middle of

<BR>the stream.&nbsp; Here and there in the distance, above

<BR>the crowded mob of low, brown roof ridges, towered

<BR>great piles of masonry, King's Palace, temples,

<BR>gorgeous and dilapidated, crumbling under the

<BR>vertical sunlight, tremendous, overpowering, al-

<BR>most palpable, which seemed to enter one's breast

<BR>with the breath of one's nostrils and soak into one's

<BR>limbs through every pore of one's skin.



<P>The ridiculous victim of jealousy had for some

<BR>reason or other to stop his engines just then.&nbsp; The

<BR>steamer drifted slowly up with the tide.&nbsp; Oblivious

<BR>of my new surroundings I walked the deck, in anx-

<BR>ious, deadened abstraction, a commingling of

<BR>romantic reverie with a very practical survey of

<BR>my qualifications.&nbsp; For the time was approaching

<BR>for me to behold my command and to prove my

<BR>worth in the ultimate test of my profession.



<P>Suddenly I heard myself called by that imbe-

<BR>cile.&nbsp; He was beckoning me to come up on his

<BR>bridge.



<P>I didn't care very much for that, but as it

<BR>seemed that he had something particular to say I

<BR>went up the ladder.



<P>He laid his hand on my shoulder and gave me a slight turn,

<BR>pointing with his other arm at the same time.



<P>"There!&nbsp; That's your ship, Captain," he said.



<P>I felt a thump in my breast--only one, as if my

<BR>heart had then ceased to beat.&nbsp; There were ten or

<BR>more ships moored along the bank, and the one

<BR>he meant was partly hidden away from my sight by her

<BR>next astern.&nbsp; He said: "We'll drift abreast her in

<BR>a moment."



<P>What was his tone?&nbsp; Mocking?&nbsp; Threatening?

<BR>Or only indifferent?&nbsp; I could not tell.&nbsp; I suspected

<BR>some malice in this unexpected manifestation of

<BR>interest.



<P>He left me, and I leaned over the rail of the

<BR>bridge looking over the side.&nbsp; I dared not raise my

<BR>eyes.&nbsp; Yet it had to be done--and, indeed, I could

<BR>not have helped myself.&nbsp; I believe I trembled.



<P>But directly my eyes had rested on my ship all

<BR>my fear vanished.&nbsp; It went off swiftly, like a bad

<BR>dream.&nbsp; Only that a dream leaves no shame be-

<BR>hind it, and that I felt a momentary shame at my

<BR>unworthy suspicions.



<P>Yes, there she was.&nbsp; Her hull, her rigging filled

<BR>my eye with a great content.&nbsp; That feeling of life-

<BR>emptiness which had made me so restless for the

<BR>last few months lost its bitter plausibility, its evil

<BR>influence, dissolved in a flow of joyous emotion.



<P>At first glance I saw that she was a high-class

<BR>vessel, a harmonious creature in the lines of her

<BR>fine body, in the proportioned tallness of her spars.

<BR>Whatever her age and her history, she had pre-

<BR>served the stamp of her origin.&nbsp; She was one of

<BR>those craft that, in virtue of their design and com-

<BR>plete finish, will never look old.&nbsp; Amongst her com-

<BR>panions moored to the bank, and all bigger than

<BR>herself, she looked like a creature of high breed--

<BR>an Arab steed in a string of cart-horses.



<P>A voice behind me said in a nasty equivocal tone:

<BR>"I hope you are satisfied with her, Captain."&nbsp; I

<BR>did not even turn my head.&nbsp; It was the master of

<BR>the steamer, and whatever he meant, whatever he

<BR>thought of her, I knew that, like some rare women,

<BR>she was one of those creatures whose mere existence

<BR>is enough to awaken an unselfish delight.&nbsp; One

<BR>feels that it is good to be in the world in which she

<BR>has her being.



<P>That illusion of life and character which charms

<BR>one in men's finest handiwork radiated from her.

<BR>An enormous bulk of teak-wood timber swung over

<BR>her hatchway; lifeless matter, looking heavier and

<BR>bigger than anything aboard of her.&nbsp; When they

<BR>started lowering it the surge of the tackle sent a

<BR>quiver through her from water-line to the trucks up

<BR>the fine nerves of her rigging, as though she had

<BR>shuddered at the weight.&nbsp; It seemed cruel to load

<BR>her so. . . .



<P>Half an hour later, putting my foot on her deck

<BR>for the first time, I received the feeling of deep

<BR>physical satisfaction.&nbsp; Nothing could equal the

<BR>fullness of that moment, the ideal completeness of

<BR>that emotional experience which had come to me

<BR>without the preliminary toil and disenchantments

<BR>of an obscure career.



<P>My rapid glance ran over her, enveloped, ap-

<BR>propriated the form concreting the abstract senti-

<BR>ment of my command.&nbsp; A lot of details perceptible

<BR>to a seaman struck my eye, vividly in that instant.

<BR>For the rest, I saw her disengaged from the material

<BR>conditions of her being.&nbsp; The shore to which she

<BR>was moored was as if it did not exist.&nbsp; What were

<BR>to me all the countries of the globe?&nbsp; In all the

<BR>parts of the world washed by navigable waters our

<BR>relation to each other would be the same--and

<BR>more intimate than there are words to express in

<BR>the language.&nbsp; Apart from that, every scene and

<BR>episode would be a mere passing show.&nbsp; The very

<BR>gang of yellow coolies busy about the main hatch

<BR>was less substantial than the stuff dreams are made

<BR>of.&nbsp; For who on earth would dream of Chinamen? . . .



<P>I went aft, ascended the poop, where, under the

<BR>awning, gleamed the brasses of the yacht-like

<BR>fittings, the polished surfaces of the rails, the glass

<BR>of the skylights.&nbsp; Right aft two seamen, busy

<BR>cleaning the steering gear, with the reflected ripples

<BR>of light running playfully up their bent backs, went

<BR>on with their work, unaware of me and of the al-

<BR>most affectionate glance I threw at them in passing

<BR>toward the companion-way of the cabin.



<P>The doors stood wide open, the slide was pushed

<BR>right back.&nbsp; The half-turn of the staircase cut off

<BR>the view of the lobby.&nbsp; A low humming ascended

<BR>from below, but it stopped abruptly at the sound of

<BR>my descending footsteps.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>ONLY the young have such moments.&nbsp; I don't

<BR>mean the very young.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The very young have,

<BR>properly speaking, no moments.&nbsp; It is the privi-

<BR>lege of early youth to live in advance of its days

<BR>in all the beautiful continuity of hope which

<BR>knows no pauses and no introspection.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One closes behind one the little gate of mere

<BR>boyishness--and enters an enchanted garden.&nbsp; Its

<BR>very shades glow with promise.&nbsp; Every turn of the

<BR>path has its seduction.&nbsp; And it isn't because it

<BR>is an undiscovered country.&nbsp; One knows well

<BR>enough that all mankind had streamed that way.

<BR>It is the charm of universal experience from which

<BR>one expects an uncommon or personal sensation--

<BR>a bit of one's own.



<P>One goes on recognizing the landmarks of the

<BR>predecessors, excited, amused, taking the hard

<BR>luck and the good luck together--the kicks and

<BR>the halfpence, as the saying is--the picturesque

<BR>common lot that holds so many possibilities for

<BR>the deserving or perhaps for the lucky.&nbsp; Yes.

<BR>One goes on.&nbsp; And the time, too, goes on--till one

<BR>perceives ahead a shadow-line warning one that

<BR>the region of early youth, too, must be left be-

<BR>hind.



<P>This is the period of life in which such moments

<BR>of which I have spoken are likely to come.&nbsp; What

<BR>moments?&nbsp; Why, the moments of boredom, of

<BR>weariness, of dissatisfaction.&nbsp; Rash moments.

<BR>I mean moments when the still young are inclined

<BR>to commit rash actions, such as getting married

<BR>suddenly or else throwing up a job for no rea-

<BR>son.



<P>This is not a marriage story.&nbsp; It wasn't so bad

<BR>as that with me.&nbsp; My action, rash as it was, had

<BR>more the character of divorce--almost of deser-

<BR>tion.&nbsp; For no reason on which a sensible person

<BR>could put a finger I threw up my job--chucked

<BR>my berth--left the ship of which the worst that

<BR>could be said was that she was a steamship and

<BR>therefore, perhaps, not entitled to that blind

<BR>loyalty which. . . .&nbsp; However, it's no use try-

<BR>ing to put a gloss on what even at the time I myself

<BR>half suspected to be a caprice.



<P>It was in an Eastern port.&nbsp; She was an Eastern

<BR>ship, inasmuch as then she belonged to that port.

<BR>She traded among dark islands on a blue reef-

<BR>scarred sea, with the Red Ensign over the taffrail

<BR>and at her masthead a house-flag, also red, but

<BR>with a green border and with a white crescent in

<BR>it.&nbsp; For an Arab owned her, and a Syed at that.

<BR>Hence the green border on the flag.&nbsp; He was the

<BR>head of a great House of Straits Arabs, but as

<BR>loyal a subject of the complex British Empire as

<BR>you could find east of the Suez Canal.&nbsp; World

<BR>politics did not trouble him at all, but he had a

<BR>great occult power amongst his own people.



<P>It was all one to us who owned the ship.&nbsp; He

<BR>had to employ white men in the shipping part of

<BR>his business, and many of those he so employed

<BR>had never set eyes on him from the first to the

<BR>last day.&nbsp; I myself saw him but once, quite

<BR>accidentally on a wharf--an old, dark little man

<BR>blind in one eye, in a snowy robe and yellow

<BR>slippers.&nbsp; He was having his hand severely kissed

<BR>by a crowd of Malay pilgrims to whom he had

<BR>done some favour, in the way of food and money.

<BR>His alms-giving, I have heard, was most exten-

<BR>sive, covering almost the whole Archipelago.&nbsp; For

<BR>isn't it said that "The charitable man is the friend

<BR>of Allah"?



<P>Excellent (and picturesque) Arab owner, about

<BR>whom one needed not to trouble one's head, a

<BR>most excellent Scottish ship--for she was that

<BR>from the keep up--excellent sea-boat, easy to

<BR>keep clean, most handy in every way, and if it

<BR>had not been for her internal propulsion, worthy

<BR>of any man's love, I cherish to this day a profound

<BR>respect for her memory.&nbsp; As to the kind of trade

<BR>she was engaged in and the character of my ship-

<BR>mates, I could not have been happier if I had had

<BR>the life and the men made to my order by a

<BR>benevolent Enchanter.



<P>And suddenly I left all this.&nbsp; I left it in that,

<BR>to us, inconsequential manner in which a bird

<BR>flies away from a comfortable branch.&nbsp; It was as

<BR>though all unknowing I had heard a whisper or

<BR>seen something.&nbsp; Well--perhaps!&nbsp; One day I was

<BR>perfectly right and the next everything was gone

<BR>--glamour, flavour, interest, contentment--every-

<BR>thing.&nbsp; It was one of these moments, you know.

<BR>The green sickness of late youth descended on me

<BR>and carried me off.&nbsp; Carried me off that ship, I

<BR>mean.



<P>We were only four white men on board, with a

<BR>large crew of Kalashes and two Malay petty

<BR>officers.&nbsp; The Captain stared hard as if wondering

<BR>what ailed me.&nbsp; But he was a sailor, and he, too,

<BR>had been young at one time.&nbsp; Presently a smile

<BR>came to lurk under his thick iron-gray moustache,

<BR>and he observed that, of course, if I felt I must

<BR>go he couldn't keep me by main force.&nbsp; And it was

<BR>arranged that I should be paid off the next morn-

<BR>ing.&nbsp; As I was going out of his cabin he added

<BR>suddenly, in a peculiar wistful tone, that he hoped

<BR>I would find what I was so anxious to go and look

<BR>for.&nbsp; A soft, cryptic utterance which seemed to

<BR>reach deeper than any diamond-hard tool could

<BR>have done.&nbsp; I do believe he understood my case.



<P>But the second engineer attacked me differently.

<BR>He was a sturdy young Scot, with a smooth face and

<BR>light eyes.&nbsp; His honest red countenance emerged

<BR>out of the engine-room companion and then the

<BR>whole robust man, with shirt sleeves turned up,

<BR>wiping slowly the massive fore-arms with a lump

<BR>of cotton-waste.&nbsp; And his light eyes expressed

<BR>bitter distaste, as though our friendship had turned

<BR>to ashes.&nbsp; He said weightily: "Oh!&nbsp; Aye!&nbsp; I've

<BR>been thinking it was about time for you to run

<BR>away home and get married to some silly girl."



<P>It was tacitly understood in the port that John

<BR>Nieven was a fierce misogynist; and the absurd

<BR>character of the sally convinced me that he meant

<BR>to be nasty--very nasty--had meant to say the

<BR>most crushing thing he could think of.&nbsp; My laugh

<BR>sounded deprecatory.&nbsp; Nobody but a friend could

<BR>be so angry as that.&nbsp; I became a little crestfallen.

<BR>Our chief engineer also took a characteristic view

<BR>of my action, but in a kindlier spirit.



<P>He was young, too, but very thin, and with a

<BR>mist of fluffy brown beard all round his haggard

<BR>face.&nbsp; All day long, at sea or in harbour, he could

<BR>be seen walking hastily up and down the after-

<BR>deck, wearing an intense, spiritually rapt ex-

<BR>pression, which was caused by a perpetual con-

<BR>sciousness of unpleasant physical sensations in

<BR>his internal economy.&nbsp; For he was a confirmed

<BR>dyspeptic.&nbsp; His view of my case was very simple.

<BR>He said it was nothing but deranged liver.&nbsp; Of

<BR>course!&nbsp; He suggested I should stay for another

<BR>trip and meantime dose myself with a certain

<BR>patent medicine in which his own belief was ab-

<BR>solute.&nbsp; "I'll tell you what I'll do.&nbsp; I'll buy you

<BR>two bottles, out of my own pocket.&nbsp; There.&nbsp; I

<BR>can't say fairer than that, can I?"



<P>I believe he would have perpetrated the atrocity

<BR>(or generosity) at the merest sign of weakening

<BR>on my part.&nbsp; By that time, however, I was more

<BR>discontented, disgusted, and dogged than ever.

<BR>The past eighteen months, so full of new and varied

<BR>experience, appeared a dreary, prosaic waste of

<BR>days.&nbsp; I felt--how shall I express it?--that there

<BR>was no truth to be got out of them.



<P>What truth?&nbsp; I should have been hard put to it to

<BR>explain.&nbsp; Probably, if pressed, I would have burst

<BR>into tears simply.&nbsp; I was young enough for that.



<P>Next day the Captain and I transacted our busi-

<BR>ness in the Harbour Office.&nbsp; It was a lofty, big,

<BR>cool, white room, where the screened light of day

<BR>glowed serenely.&nbsp; Everybody in it--the officials,

<BR>the public--were in white.&nbsp; Only the heavy

<BR>polished desks gleamed darkly in a central avenue,

<BR>and some papers lying on them were blue.&nbsp; Enor-

<BR>mous punkahs sent from on high a gentle draught

<BR>through that immaculate interior and upon our

<BR>perspiring heads.



<P>The official behind the desk we approached

<BR>grinned amiably and kept it up till, in answer to

<BR>his perfunctory question, "Sign off and on again?"

<BR>my Captain answered, "No!&nbsp; Signing off for good."

<BR>And then his grin vanished in sudden solemnity.

<BR>He did not look at me again till he handed me my

<BR>papers with a sorrowful expression, as if they had

<BR>been my passports for Hades.



<P>While I was putting them away he murmured

<BR>some question to the Captain, and I heard the

<BR>latter answer good-humouredly:



<P>"No.&nbsp; He leaves us to go home."



<P>"Oh!" the other exclaimed, nodding mournfully

<BR>over my sad condition.



<P>I didn't know him outside the official building,

<BR>but he leaned forward the desk to shake hands

<BR>with me, compassionately, as one would with some

<BR>poor devil going out to be hanged; and I am afraid

<BR>I performed my part ungraciously, in the hardened

<BR>manner of an impenitent criminal.



<P>No homeward-bound mail-boat was due for

<BR>three or four days.&nbsp; Being now a man without a

<BR>ship, and having for a time broken my connection

<BR>with the sea--become, in fact, a mere potential

<BR>passenger--it would have been more appropriate

<BR>perhaps if I had gone to stay at an hotel.&nbsp; There

<BR>it was, too, within a stone's throw of the Harbour

<BR>Office, low, but somehow palatial, displaying its

<BR>white, pillared pavilions surrounded by trim grass

<BR>plots.&nbsp; I would have felt a passenger indeed in

<BR>there!&nbsp; I gave it a hostile glance and directed my

<BR>steps toward the Officers' Sailors' Home.



<P>I walked in the sunshine, disregarding it, and in

<BR>the shade of the big trees on the esplanade without

<BR>enjoying it.&nbsp; The heat of the tropical East de-

<BR>scended through the leafy boughs, enveloping my

<BR>thinly-clad body, clinging to my rebellious dis-

<BR>content, as if to rob it of its freedom.



<P>The Officers' Home was a large bungalow with

<BR>a wide verandah and a curiously suburban-looking

<BR>little garden of bushes and a few trees between it

<BR>and the street.&nbsp; That institution partook some-

<BR>what of the character of a residential club, but

<BR>with a slightly Governmental flavour about it,

<BR>because it was administered by the Harbour Office.

<BR>Its manager was officially styled Chief Steward.

<BR>He was an unhappy, wizened little man, who if put

<BR>into a jockey's rig would have looked the part to

<BR>perfection.&nbsp; But it was obvious that at some time

<BR>or other in his life, in some capacity or other, he

<BR>had been connected with the sea.&nbsp; Possibly in the

<BR>comprehensive capacity of a failure.



<P>I should have thought his employment a very

<BR>easy one, but he used to affirm for some reason or

<BR>other that his job would be the death of him some

<BR>day.&nbsp; It was rather mysterious.&nbsp; Perhaps everything

<BR>naturally was too much trouble for him.&nbsp; He cer-

<BR>tainly seemed to hate having people in the house.



<P>On entering it I thought he must be feeling

<BR>pleased.&nbsp; It was as still as a tomb.&nbsp; I could see no

<BR>one in the living rooms; and the verandah, too,

<BR>was empty, except for a man at the far end dozing

<BR>prone in a long chair.&nbsp; At the noise of my footsteps

<BR>he opened one horribly fish-like eye.&nbsp; He was a

<BR>stranger to me.&nbsp; I retreated from there, and cross-

<BR>ing the dining room--a very bare apartment with

<BR>a motionless punkah hanging over the centre table

<BR>--I knocked at a door labelled in black letters:

<BR>"Chief Steward."



<P>The answer to my knock being a vexed and dole-

<BR>ful plaint: "Oh, dear!&nbsp; Oh, dear!&nbsp; What is it

<BR>now?"&nbsp; I went in at once.



<P>It was a strange room to find in the tropics.

<BR>Twilight and stuffiness reigned in there.&nbsp; The

<BR>fellow had hung enormously ample, dusty, cheap

<BR>lace curtains over his windows, which were shut.

<BR>Piles of cardboard boxes, such as milliners and

<BR>dressmakers use in Europe, cumbered the corners;

<BR>and by some means he had procured for himself

<BR>the sort of furniture that might have come out of

<BR>a respectable parlour in the East End of London

<BR>--a horsehair sofa, arm-chairs of the same.&nbsp; I

<BR>glimpsed grimy antimacassars scattered over that

<BR>horrid upholstery, which was awe-inspiring, in-

<BR>somuch that one could not guess what mysterious

<BR>accident, need, or fancy had collected it there.

<BR>Its owner had taken off his tunic, and in white

<BR>trousers and a thin, short-sleeved singlet prowled

<BR>behind the chair-backs nursing his meagre el-

<BR>bows.



<P>An exclamation of dismay escaped him when he

<BR>heard that I had come for a stay; but he could not

<BR>deny that there were plenty of vacant rooms.



<P>"Very well.&nbsp; Can you give me the one I had

<BR>before?"



<P>He emitted a faint moan from behind a pile of

<BR>cardboard boxes on the table, which might have

<BR>contained gloves or handkerchies or neckties.&nbsp; I

<BR>wonder what the fellow did keep in them?&nbsp; There

<BR>was a smell of decaying coral, or Oriental dust

<BR>of zoological speciments in that den of his.&nbsp; I

<BR>could only see the top of his head and his un-

<BR>happy eyes levelled at me over the barrier.



<P>"It's only for a couple of days," I said, intending

<BR>to cheer him up.



<P>"Perhaps you would like to pay in advance?"

<BR>he suggested eagerly.



<P>"Certainly not!" I burst out directly I could

<BR>speak.&nbsp; "Never heard of such a thing!&nbsp; This is

<BR>the most infernal cheek. . . ."



<P>He had seized his head in both hands--a gesture

<BR>of despair which checked my indignation.



<P>"Oh, dear!&nbsp; Oh, dear!&nbsp; Don't fly out like this.

<BR>I am asking everybody."



<P>"I don't believe it," I said bluntly.



<P>"Well, I am going to.&nbsp; And if you gentlemen

<BR>all agreed to pay in advance I could make Hamil-

<BR>ton pay up, too.&nbsp; He's always turning up ashore

<BR>dead broke, and even when he has some money

<BR>he won't settle his bills.&nbsp; I don't know what to do

<BR>with him.&nbsp; He swears at me and tells me I can't

<BR>chuck a white man out into the street here.&nbsp; So if

<BR>you only would. . . ."



<P>I was amazed.&nbsp; Incredulous, too.&nbsp; I suspected

<BR>the fellow of gratuitous impertinence.&nbsp; I told him

<BR>with marked emphasis that I would see him and

<BR>Hamilton hanged first, and requested him to con-

<BR>duct me to my room with no more of his nonsense.

<BR>He produced then a key from somewhere and led

<BR>the way out of his lair, giving me a vicious sidelong

<BR>look in passing.



<P>"Any one I know staying here?" I asked him

<BR>before he left my room.



<P>He had recovered his usual pained impatient

<BR>tone, and said that Captain Giles was there, back

<BR>from a Solo Sea trip.&nbsp; Two other guests were stay-

<BR>ing also.&nbsp; He paused.&nbsp; And, of course, Hamilton,

<BR>he added.



<P>"Oh, yes!&nbsp; Hamilton," I said, and the miserable

<BR>creature took himself off with a final groan.



<P>His impudence still rankled when I came into the

<BR>dining room at tiffin time.&nbsp; He was there on duty

<BR>overlooking the Chinamen servants.&nbsp; The tiffin

<BR>was laid on one end only of the long table, and the

<BR>punkah was stirring the hot air lazily--mostly

<BR>above a barren waste of polished wood.



<P>We were four around the cloth.&nbsp; The dozing

<BR>stranger from the chair was one.&nbsp; Both his eyes

<BR>were partly opened now, but they did not seem to

<BR>see anything.&nbsp; He was supine.&nbsp; The dignified

<BR>person next him, with short side whiskers and a

<BR>carefully scraped chin, was, of course, Hamilton.

<BR>I have never seen any one so full of dignity for the

<BR>station in life Providence had been pleased to

<BR>place him in.&nbsp; I had been told that he regarded me

<BR>as a rank outsider.&nbsp; He raised not only his eyes,

<BR>but his eyebrows as well, at the sound I made

<BR>pulling back my chair.



<P>Captain Giles was at the head of the table.&nbsp; I

<BR>exchanged a few words of greeting with him and sat

<BR>down on his left.&nbsp; Stout and pale, with a great

<BR>shiny dome of a bald forehead and prominent

<BR>brown eyes, he might have been anything but a

<BR>seaman.&nbsp; You would not have been surprised to

<BR>learn that he was an architect.&nbsp; To me (I know

<BR>how absurd it is) to me he looked like a church-

<BR>warden.&nbsp; He had the appearance of a man from

<BR>whom you would expect sound advice, moral

<BR>sentiments, with perhaps a platitude or two thrown

<BR>in on occasion, not from a desire to dazzle, but

<BR>from honest conviction.



<P>Though very well known and appreciated in the

<BR>shipping world, he had no regular employment.

<BR>He did not want it.&nbsp; He had his own peculiar

<BR>position.&nbsp; He was an expert.&nbsp; An expert in--how

<BR>shall I say it?--in intricate navigation.&nbsp; He was

<BR>supposed to know more about remote and im-

<BR>perfectly charted parts of the Archipelago than any

<BR>man living.&nbsp; His brain must have been a perfect

<BR>warehouse of reefs, positions, bearings, images of

<BR>headlands, shapes of obscure coasts, aspects of

<BR>innumerable islands, desert and otherwise.&nbsp; Any

<BR>ship, for instance, bound on a trip to Palawan or

<BR>somewhere that way would have Captain Giles on

<BR>board, either in temporary command or "to assist

<BR>the master."&nbsp; It was said that he had a retaining

<BR>fee from a wealthy firm of Chinese steamship

<BR>owners, in view of such services.&nbsp; Besides, he was

<BR>always ready to relieve any man who wished to

<BR>take a spell ashore for a time.&nbsp; No owner was ever

<BR>known to object to an arrangement of that sort.

<BR>For it seemed to be the established opinion at the

<BR>port that Captain Giles was as good as the best, if

<BR>not a little better.&nbsp; But in Hamilton's view he was

<BR>an "outsider."&nbsp; I believe that for Hamilton the

<BR>generalisation "outsider" covered the whole lot of

<BR>us; though I suppose that he made some dis-

<BR>tinctions in his mind.



<P>I didn't try to make conversation with Captain

<BR>Giles, whom I had not seen more than twice in

<BR>my life.&nbsp; But, of course, he knew who I was.

<BR>After a while, inclining his big shiny head my way,

<BR>he addressed me first in his friendly fashion.&nbsp; He

<BR>presumed from seeing me there, he said, that I had

<BR>come ashore for a couple of days' leave.



<P>He was a low-voiced man.&nbsp; I spoke a little

<BR>louder, saying that: No--I had left the ship for

<BR>good.



<P>"A free man for a bit," was his comment.



<P>"I suppose I may call myself that--since eleven

<BR>o'clock," I said.



<P>Hamilton had stopped eating at the sound of

<BR>our voices.&nbsp; He laid down his knife and fork gently,

<BR>got up, and muttering something about "this

<BR>infernal heat cutting one's appetite," went out of

<BR>the room.&nbsp; Almost immediately we heard him

<BR>leave the house down the verandah steps.



<P>On this Captain Giles remarked easily that the

<BR>fellow had no doubt gone off to look after my old

<BR>job.&nbsp; The Chief Steward, who had been leaning

<BR>against the wall, brought his face of an unhappy

<BR>goat nearer to the table and addressed us dole-

<BR>fully.&nbsp; His object was to unburden himself of his

<BR>eternal grievance against Hamilton.&nbsp; The man

<BR>kept him in hot water with the Harbour Office as

<BR>to the state of his accounts.&nbsp; He wished to good-

<BR>ness he would get my job, though in truth what

<BR>would it be?&nbsp; Temporary relief at best.



<P>I said: "You needn't worry.&nbsp; He won't get my

<BR>job.&nbsp; My successor is on board already."



<P>He was surprised, and I believe his face fell

<BR>a little at the news.&nbsp; Captain Giles gave a soft

<BR>laugh.&nbsp; We got up and went out on the verandah,

<BR>leaving the supine stranger to be dealt with by

<BR>the Chinamen.&nbsp; The last thing I saw they had put

<BR>a plate with a slice of pine-apple on it before him

<BR>and stood back to watch what would happen.

<BR>But the experiment seemed a failure.&nbsp; He sat in-

<BR>sensible.



<P>It was imparted to me in a low voice by Captain

<BR>Giles that this was an officer of some Rajah's yacht

<BR>which had come into our port to be dry-docked.

<BR>Must have been "seeing life" last night, he added,

<BR>wrinkling his nose in an intimate, confidential way

<BR>which pleased me vastly.&nbsp; For Captain Giles had

<BR>prestige.&nbsp; He was credited with wonderful ad-

<BR>ventures and with some mysterious tragedy in his

<BR>life.&nbsp; And no man had a word to say against him.

<BR>He continued:



<P>"I remember him first coming ashore here some

<BR>years ago.&nbsp; Seems only the other day.&nbsp; He was a

<BR>nice boy.&nbsp; Oh! these nice boys!"



<P>I could not help laughing aloud.&nbsp; He looked

<BR>startled, then joined in the laugh.&nbsp; "No!&nbsp; No!

<BR>I didn't mean that," he cried.&nbsp; "What I meant

<BR>is that some of them do go soft mighty quick out

<BR>here."



<P>Jocularly I suggested the beastly heat as the

<BR>first cause.&nbsp; But Captain Giles disclosed himself

<BR>possessed of a deeper philosophy.&nbsp; Things out

<BR>East were made easy for white men.&nbsp; That was

<BR>all right.&nbsp; The difficulty was to go on keeping

<BR>white, and some of these nice boys did not know

<BR>how.&nbsp; He gave me a searching look, and in a

<BR>benevolent, heavy-uncle manner asked point blank:



<P>"Why did you throw up your berth?"



<P>I became angry all of a sudden; for you can

<BR>understand how exasperating such a question was

<BR>to a man who didn't know.&nbsp; I said to myself that

<BR>I ought to shut up that moralist; and to him

<BR>aloud I said with challenging politeness:



<P>"Why . . . ?&nbsp; Do you disapprove?"



<P>He was too disconcerted to do more than mutter

<BR>confusedly: "I! . . .&nbsp; In a general way.

<BR>. . ." and then gave me up.&nbsp; But he retired in

<BR>good order, under the cover of a heavily humorous

<BR>remark that he, too, was getting soft, and that this

<BR>was his time for taking his little siesta--when he

<BR>was on shore.&nbsp; "Very bad habit.&nbsp; Very bad

<BR>habit."



<P>There was a simplicity in the man which would

<BR>have disarmed a touchiness even more youthful

<BR>than mine.&nbsp; So when next day at tiffin he bent his

<BR>head toward me and said that he had met my

<BR>late Captain last evening, adding in an undertone:

<BR>"He's very sorry you left.&nbsp; He had never had a

<BR>mate that suited him so well," I answered him

<BR>earnestly, without any affectation, that I certainly

<BR>hadn't been so comfortable in any ship or with any

<BR>commander in all my sea-going days.



<P>"Well--then," he murmured.



<P>"Haven't you heard, Captain Giles, that I in-

<BR>tend to go home?"



<P>"Yes," he said benevolently.&nbsp; "I have heard

<BR>that sort of thing so often before."



<P>"What of that?" I cried.&nbsp; I thought he was the

<BR>most dull, unimaginative man I had ever met.&nbsp; I

<BR>don't know what more I would have said, but

<BR>the much-belated Hamilton came in just then

<BR>and took his usual seat.&nbsp; So I dropped into a mum-

<BR>ble.



<P>"Anyhow, you shall see it done this time."



<P>Hamilton, beautifully shaved, gave Captain

<BR>Giles a curt nod, but didn't even condescend to

<BR>raise his eyebrows at me; and when he spoke it was

<BR>only to tell the Chief Steward that the food on his

<BR>plate wasn't fit to be set before a gentleman.&nbsp; The

<BR>individual addressed seemed much too unhappy to

<BR>groan.&nbsp; He cast his eyes up to the punkah and

<BR>that was all.



<P>Captain Giles and I got up from the table, and

<BR>the stranger next to Hamilton followed our ex-

<BR>ample, manoeuvring himself to his feet with

<BR>difficulty.&nbsp; He, poor fellow, not because he was

<BR>hungry but I verily believe only to recover his

<BR>self-respect, had tried to put some of that un-

<BR>worthy food into his mouth.&nbsp; But after dropping

<BR>his fork twice and generally making a failure of

<BR>it, he had sat still with an air of intense mortifica-

<BR>tion combined with a ghastly glazed stare.&nbsp; Both

<BR>Giles and I had avoided looking his way at

<BR>table.



<P>On the verandah he stopped short on purpose to

<BR>address to us anxiously a long remark which I

<BR>failed to understand completely.&nbsp; It sounded like

<BR>some horrible unknown language.&nbsp; But when

<BR>Captain Giles, after only an instant for reflection,

<BR>assured him with homely friendliness, "Aye, to be

<BR>sure.&nbsp; You are right there," he appeared very

<BR>much gratified indeed, and went away (pretty

<BR>straight, too) to seek a distant long chair.



<P>"What was he trying to say?" I asked with

<BR>disgust.



<P>"I don't know.&nbsp; Mustn't be down too much on

<BR>a fellow.&nbsp; He's feeling pretty wretched, you may

<BR>be sure; and to-morrow he'll feel worse yet."



<P>Judging by the man's appearance it seemed im-

<BR>possible.&nbsp; I wondered what sort of complicated de-

<BR>bauch had reduced him to that unspeakable con-

<BR>dition.&nbsp; Captain Giles' benevolence was spoiled by

<BR>a curious air of complacency which I disliked.&nbsp; I

<BR>said with a little laugh:



<P>"Well, he will have you to look after him."

<BR>He made a deprecatory gesture, sat down, and

<BR>took up a paper.&nbsp; I did the same.&nbsp; The papers

<BR>were old and uninteresting, filled up mostly with

<BR>dreary stereotyped descriptions of Queen Victoria's

<BR>first jubilee celebrations.&nbsp; Probably we should

<BR>have quickly fallen into a tropical afternoon doze

<BR>if it had not been for Hamilton's voice raised in

<BR>the dining room.&nbsp; He was finishing his tiffin there.

<BR>The big double doors stood wide open permanently,

<BR>and he could not have had any idea how near to the

<BR>doorway our chairs were placed.&nbsp; He was heard in

<BR>a loud, supercilious tone answering some state-

<BR>ment ventured by the Chief Steward.



<P>"I am not going to be rushed into anything.

<BR>They will be glad enough to get a gentleman I

<BR>imagine.&nbsp; There is no hurry."



<P>A loud whispering from the Steward succeeded

<BR>and then again Hamilton was heard with even

<BR>intenser scorn.



<P>"What?&nbsp; That young ass who fancies himself

<BR>for having been chief mate with Kent so long?

<BR>. . .&nbsp; Preposterous."



<P>Giles and I looked at each other.&nbsp; Kent being

<BR>the came of my late commander, Captain Giles'

<BR>whisper, "He's talking of you," seemed to me sheer

<BR>waste of breath.&nbsp; The Chief Steward must have

<BR>stuck to his point, whatever it was, because Hamil-

<BR>ton was heard again more supercilious if possible,

<BR>and also very emphatic:



<P>"Rubbish, my good man!&nbsp; One doesn't COMPETE with

<BR>a rank outsider like that.&nbsp; There's plenty of time."



<P>Then there were pushing of chairs, footsteps in

<BR>the next room, and plaintive expostulations from

<BR>the Steward, who was pursuing Hamilton, even out

<BR>of doors through the main entrance.



<P>"That's a very insulting sort of man," remarked

<BR>Captain Giles--superfluously, I thought.&nbsp; "Very

<BR>insulting.&nbsp; You haven't offended him in some way,

<BR>have you?"



<P>"Never spoke to him in my life," I said grumpily.

<BR>"Can't imagine what he means by competing.&nbsp; He

<BR>has been trying for my job after I left--and didn't

<BR>get it.&nbsp; But that isn't exactly competition."



<P>Captain Giles balanced his big benevolent head

<BR>thoughtfully.&nbsp; "He didn't get it," he repeated

<BR>very slowly.&nbsp; "No, not likely either, with Kent.

<BR>Kent is no end sorry you left him.&nbsp; He gives you

<BR>the name of a good seaman, too."



<P>I flung away the paper I was still holding.&nbsp; I sat

<BR>up, I slapped the table with my open palm.&nbsp; I

<BR>wanted to know why he would keep harping on

<BR>that, my absolutely private affair.&nbsp; It was exas-

<BR>perating, really.



<P>Captain Giles silenced me by the perfect

<BR>equanimity of his gaze.&nbsp; "Nothing to be annoyed

<BR>about," he murmured reasonably, with an evident

<BR>desire to soothe the childish irritation he had

<BR>aroused.&nbsp; And he was really a man of an appear-

<BR>ance so inoffensive that I tried to explain myself

<BR>as much as I could.&nbsp; I told him that I did not want

<BR>to hear any more about what was past and gone.

<BR>It had been very nice while it lasted, but now it

<BR>was done with I preferred not to talk about it or

<BR>even think about it.&nbsp; I had made up my mind to go

<BR>home.



<P>He listened to the whole tirade in a particular

<BR>lending-the-ear attitude, as if trying to detect a

<BR>false note in it somewhere; then straightened him-

<BR>self up and appeared to ponder sagaciously over

<BR>the matter.



<P>"Yes.&nbsp; You told me you meant to go home.

<BR>Anything in view there?"



<P>Instead of telling him that it was none of his

<BR>business I said sullenly:



<P>"Nothing that I know of."



<P>I had indeed considered that rather blank side of

<BR>the situation I had created for myself by leaving

<BR>suddenly my very satisfactory employment.&nbsp; And

<BR>I was not very pleased with it.&nbsp; I had it on the tip

<BR>of my tongue to say that common sense had noth-

<BR>ing to do with my action, and that therefore it

<BR>didn't deserve the interest Captain Giles seemed

<BR>to be taking in it.&nbsp; But he was puffing at a short

<BR>wooden pipe now, and looked so guileless, dense,

<BR>and commonplace, that it seemed hardly worth

<BR>while to puzzle him either with truth or sarcasm.



<P>He blew a cloud of smoke, then surprised me

<BR>by a very abrupt: "Paid your passage money

<BR>yet?"



<P>Overcome by the shameless pertinacity of a

<BR>man to whom it was rather difficult to be rude,

<BR>I replied with exaggerated meekness that I had

<BR>not done so yet.&nbsp; I thought there would be plenty

<BR>of time to do that to-morrow.



<P>And I was about to turn away, withdrawing

<BR>my privacy from his fatuous, objectless attempts

<BR>to test what sort of stuff it was made of, when he

<BR>laid down his pipe in an extremely significant

<BR>manner, you know, as if a critical moment had

<BR>come, and leaned sideways over the table be-

<BR>tween us.



<P>"Oh!&nbsp; You haven't yet!"&nbsp; He dropped his

<BR>voice mysteriously.&nbsp; "Well, then I think you

<BR>ought to know that there's something going on

<BR>here."



<P>I had never in my life felt more detached from

<BR>all earthly goings on.&nbsp; Freed from the sea for a

<BR>time, I preserved the sailor's consciousness of

<BR>complete independence from all land affairs.

<BR>How could they concern me?&nbsp; I gazed at Captain

<BR>Giles' animation with scorn rather than with

<BR>curiosity.



<P>To his obviously preparatory question whether

<BR>our Steward had spoken to me that day I said he

<BR>hadn't.&nbsp; And what's more he would have had

<BR>precious little encouragement if he had tried to.

<BR>I didn't want the fellow to speak to me at all.



<P>Unrebuked by my petulance, Captain Giles,

<BR>with an air of immense sagacity, began to tell me

<BR>a minute tale about a Harbour Office peon.&nbsp; It

<BR>was absolutely pointless.&nbsp; A peon was seen walk-

<BR>ing that morning on the verandah with a letter

<BR>in his hand.&nbsp; It was in an official envelope.&nbsp; As

<BR>the habit of these fellows is, he had shown it

<BR>to the first white man he came across.&nbsp; That man

<BR>was our friend in the arm-chair.&nbsp; He, as I knew,

<BR>was not in a state to interest himself in any sub-

<BR>lunary matters.&nbsp; He could only wave the peon

<BR>away.&nbsp; The peon then wandered on along the

<BR>verandah and came upon Captain Giles, who

<BR>was there by an extraordinary chance. . . .



<P>At this point he stopped with a profound look.

<BR>The letter, he continued, was addressed to the

<BR>Chief Steward.&nbsp; Now what could Captain Ellis,

<BR>the Master Attendant, want to write to the

<BR>Steward for?&nbsp; The fellow went every morning,

<BR>anyhow, to the Harbour Office with his report,

<BR>for orders or what not.&nbsp; He hadn't been back

<BR>more than an hour before there was an office

<BR>peon chasing him with a note.&nbsp; Now what was

<BR>that for?



<P>And he began to speculate.&nbsp; It was not for this

<BR>--and it could not be for that.&nbsp; As to that other

<BR>thing it was unthinkable.



<P>The fatuousness of all this made me stare.&nbsp; If

<BR>the man had not been somehow a sympathetic

<BR>personality I would have resented it like an in-

<BR>sult.&nbsp; As it was, I felt only sorry for him.&nbsp; Some-

<BR>thing remarkably earnest in his gaze prevented

<BR>me from laughing in his face.&nbsp; Neither did I

<BR>yawn at him.&nbsp; I just stared.



<P>His tone became a shade more mysterious.

<BR>Directly the fellow (meaning the Steward) got

<BR>that note he rushed for his hat and bolted out of

<BR>the house.&nbsp; But it wasn't because the note called

<BR>him to the Harbour Office.&nbsp; He didn't go there.

<BR>He was not absent long enough for that.&nbsp; He came

<BR>darting back in no time, flung his hat away, and

<BR>raced about the dining room moaning and slapping

<BR>his forehead.&nbsp; All these exciting facts and mani-

<BR>festations had been observed by Captain Giles.

<BR>He had, it seems, been meditating upon them

<BR>ever since.



<P>I began to pity him profoundly.&nbsp; And in a

<BR>tone which I tried to make as little sarcastic as

<BR>possible I said that I was glad he had found

<BR>something to occupy his morning hours.



<P>With his disarming simplicity he made me ob-

<BR>serve, as if it were a matter of some consequence,

<BR>how strange it was that he should have spent

<BR>the morning indoors at all.&nbsp; He generally was

<BR>out before tiffin, visiting various offices, seeing his

<BR>friends in the harbour, and so on.&nbsp; He had felt

<BR>out of sorts somewhat on rising.&nbsp; Nothing much.

<BR>Just enough to make him feel lazy.



<P>All this with a sustained, holding stare which,

<BR>in conjunction with the general inanity of the

<BR>discourse, conveyed the impression of mild, dreary

<BR>lunacy.&nbsp; And when he hitched his chair a little

<BR>and dropped his voice to the low note of mystery,

<BR>it flashed upon me that high professional reputa-

<BR>tion was not necessarily a guarantee of sound

<BR>mind.



<P>It never occurred to me then that I didn't

<BR>know in what soundness of mind exactly con-

<BR>sisted and what a delicate and, upon the whole,

<BR>unimportant matter it was.&nbsp; With some idea of

<BR>not hurting his feelings I blinked at him in an

<BR>interested manner.&nbsp; But when he proceeded to

<BR>ask me mysteriously whether I remembered what

<BR>had passed just now between that Steward of

<BR>ours and "that man Hamilton," I only grunted

<BR>sourly assent and turned away my head.



<P>"Aye.&nbsp; But do you remember every word?" he

<BR>insisted tactfully.



<P>"I don't know.&nbsp; It's none of my business," I

<BR>snapped out, consigning, moreover, the Steward

<BR>and Hamilton aloud to eternal perdition.



<P>I meant to be very energetic and final, but

<BR>Captain Giles continued to gaze at me thought-

<BR>fully.&nbsp; Nothing could stop him.&nbsp; He went on to

<BR>point out that my personality was involved in

<BR>that conversation.&nbsp; When I tried to preserve the

<BR>semblance of unconcern he became positively

<BR>cruel.&nbsp; I heard what the man had said?&nbsp; Yes?

<BR>What did I think of it then?--he wanted to know.



<P>Captain Giles' appearance excluding the sus-

<BR>picion of mere sly malice, I came to the conclusion

<BR>that he was simply the most tactless idiot on earth.

<BR>I almost despised myself for the weakness of

<BR>attempting to enlighten his common understand-

<BR>ing.&nbsp; I started to explain that I did not think

<BR>anything whatever.&nbsp; Hamilton was not worth a

<BR>thought.&nbsp; What such an offensive loafer . . .

<BR>"Aye! that he is," interjected Captain Giles

<BR>. . . thought or said was below any decent

<BR>man's contempt, and I did not propose to take

<BR>the slightest notice of it.



<P>This attitude seemed to me so simple and ob-

<BR>vious that I was really astonished at Giles giving

<BR>no sign of assent.&nbsp; Such perfect stupidity was

<BR>almost interesting.



<P>"What would you like me to do?" I asked,

<BR>laughing.&nbsp; "I can't start a row with him because

<BR>of the opinion he has formed of me.&nbsp; Of course,

<BR>I've heard of the contemptuous way he alludes

<BR>to me.&nbsp; But he doesn't intrude his contempt on

<BR>my notice.&nbsp; He has never expressed it in my

<BR>hearing.&nbsp; For even just now he didn't know we

<BR>could hear him.&nbsp; I should only make myself

<BR>ridiculous."



<P>That hopeless Giles went on puffing at his pipe

<BR>moodily.&nbsp; All at once his face cleared, and he spoke.



<P>"You missed my point."



<P>"Have I?&nbsp; I am very glad to hear it," I said.



<P>With increasing animation he stated again

<BR>that I had missed his point.&nbsp; Entirely.&nbsp; And in a

<BR>tone of growing self-conscious complacency he

<BR>told me that few things escaped his attention,

<BR>and he was rather used to think them out, and

<BR>generally from his experience of life and men ar-

<BR>rived at the right conclusion.



<P>This bit of self-praise, of course, fitted excel-

<BR>lently the laborious inanity of the whole conversa-

<BR>tion.&nbsp; The whole thing strengthened in me that

<BR>obscure feeling of life being but a waste of days,

<BR>which, half-unconsciously, had driven me out of

<BR>a comfortable berth, away from men I liked, to

<BR>flee from the menace of emptiness . . . and

<BR>to find inanity at the first turn.&nbsp; Here was a man

<BR>of recognized character and achievement disclosed

<BR>as an absurd and dreary chatterer.&nbsp; And it was

<BR>probably like this everywhere--from east to west,

<BR>from the bottom to the top of the social scale.



<P>A great discouragement fell on me.&nbsp; A spiritual

<BR>drowsiness.&nbsp; Giles' voice was going on compla-

<BR>cently; the very voice of the universal hollow

<BR>conceit.&nbsp; And I was no longer angry with it.

<BR>There was nothing original, nothing new, star-

<BR>tling, informing, to expect from the world; no op-

<BR>portunities to find out something about oneself,

<BR>no wisdom to acquire, no fun to enjoy.&nbsp; Every-

<BR>thing was stupid and overrated, even as Captain

<BR>Giles was.&nbsp; So be it.



<P>The name of Hamilton suddenly caught my

<BR>ear and roused me up.



<P>"I thought we had done with him," I said, with

<BR>the greatest possible distaste.



<P>"Yes.&nbsp; But considering what we happened to

<BR>hear just now I think you ought to do it."



<P>"Ought to do it?"&nbsp; I sat up bewildered.&nbsp; "Do

<BR>what?"



<P>Captain Giles confronted me very much sur-

<BR>prised.



<P>"Why!&nbsp; Do what I have been advising you to

<BR>try.&nbsp; You go and ask the Steward what was there

<BR>in that letter from the Harbour Office.&nbsp; Ask him

<BR>straight out."



<P>I remained speechless for a time.&nbsp; Here was

<BR>something unexpected and original enough to be

<BR>altogether incomprehensible.&nbsp; I murmured, as-

<BR>tounded:



<P>"But I thought it was Hamilton that you . . ."



<P>"Exactly.&nbsp; Don't you let him.&nbsp; You do what I

<BR>tell you.&nbsp; You tackle that Steward.&nbsp; You'll make

<BR>him jump, I bet," insisted Captain Giles, waving

<BR>his smouldering pipe impressively at me.&nbsp; Then

<BR>he took three rapid puffs at it.



<P>His aspect of triumphant acuteness was inde-

<BR>scribable.&nbsp; Yet the man remained a strangely

<BR>sympathetic creature.&nbsp; Benevolence radiated from

<BR>him ridiculously, mildly, impressively.&nbsp; It was

<BR>irritating, too.&nbsp; But I pointed out coldly, as one

<BR>who deals with the incomprehensible, that I

<BR>didn't see any reason to expose myself to a snub

<BR>from the fellow.&nbsp; He was a very unsatisfactory

<BR>steward and a miserable wretch besides, but I

<BR>would just as soon think of tweaking his nose.



<P>"Tweaking his nose," said Captain Giles in a

<BR>scandalized tone.&nbsp; "Much use it would be to

<BR>you."



<P>That remark was so irrelevant that one could

<BR>make no answer to it.&nbsp; But the sense of the ab-

<BR>surdity was beginning at last to exercise its well-

<BR>known fascination.&nbsp; I felt I must not let the

<BR>man talk to me any more.&nbsp; I got up, observing

<BR>curtly that he was too much for me--that I

<BR>couldn't make him out.



<P>Before I had time to move away he spoke

<BR>again in a changed tone of obstinacy and puffing

<BR>nervously at his pipe.



<P>"Well--he's a--no account cuss--anyhow.

<BR>You just--ask him.&nbsp; That's all."



<P>That new manner impressed me--or rather

<BR>made me pause.&nbsp; But sanity asserting its sway

<BR>at once I left the verandah after giving him a

<BR>mirthless smile.&nbsp; In a few strides I found myself

<BR>in the dining room, now cleared and empty.&nbsp; But

<BR>during that short time various thoughts occurred

<BR>to me, such as: that Giles had been making fun

<BR>of me, expecting some amusement at my expense;

<BR>that I probably looked silly and gullible; that I

<BR>knew very little of life. . . .



<P>The door facing me across the dining room flew

<BR>open to my extreme surprise.&nbsp; It was the door

<BR>inscribed with the word "Steward" and the man

<BR>himself ran out of his stuffy, Philistinish lair in

<BR>his absurd, hunted-animal manner, making for the

<BR>garden door.



<P>To this day I don't know what made me call

<BR>after him.&nbsp; "I say!&nbsp; Wait a minute."&nbsp; Perhaps

<BR>it was the sidelong glance he gave me; or possibly

<BR>I was yet under the influence of Captain Giles'

<BR>mysterious earnestness.&nbsp; Well, it was an impulse

<BR>of some sort; an effect of that force somewhere

<BR>within our lives which shapes them this way or

<BR>that.&nbsp; For if these words had not escaped from my

<BR>lips (my will had nothing to do with that) my

<BR>existence would, to be sure, have been still a sea-

<BR>man's existence, but directed on now to me utterly

<BR>inconceivable lines.



<P>No.&nbsp; My will had nothing to do with it.&nbsp; In-

<BR>deed, no sooner had I made that fateful noise

<BR>than I became extremely sorry for it.&nbsp; Had the

<BR>man stopped and faced me I would have had to

<BR>retire in disorder.&nbsp; For I had no notion to carry

<BR>out Captain Giles' idiotic joke, either at my own

<BR>expense or at the expense of the Steward.



<P>But here the old human instinct of the chase

<BR>came into play.&nbsp; He pretended to be deaf, and I,

<BR>without thinking a second about it, dashed along

<BR>my own side of the dining table and cut him off

<BR>at the very door.



<P>"Why can't you answer when you are spoken

<BR>to?" I asked roughly.



<P>He leaned against the lintel of the door.&nbsp; He

<BR>looked extremely wretched.&nbsp; Human nature is, I

<BR>fear, not very nice right through.&nbsp; There are ugly

<BR>spots in it.&nbsp; I found myself growing angry, and

<BR>that, I believe, only because my quarry looked

<BR>so woe-begone.&nbsp; Miserable beggar!



<P>I went for him without more ado.&nbsp; "I under-

<BR>stand there was an official communication to the

<BR>Home from the Harbour Office this morning.&nbsp; Is

<BR>that so?"



<P>Instead of telling me to mind my own business,

<BR>as he might have done, he began to whine with

<BR>an undertone of impudence.&nbsp; He couldn't see me

<BR>anywhere this morning.&nbsp; He couldn't be expected

<BR>to run all over the town after me.



<P>"Who wants you to?" I cried.&nbsp; And then my

<BR>eyes became opened to the inwardness of things

<BR>and speeches the triviality of which had been so

<BR>baffling and tiresome.



<P>I told him I wanted to know what was in that

<BR>letter.&nbsp; My sternness of tone and behaviour was

<BR>only half assumed.&nbsp; Curiosity can be a very fierce

<BR>sentiment--at times.



<P>He took refuge in a silly, muttering sulkiness.

<BR>It was nothing to me, he mumbled.&nbsp; I had told

<BR>him I was going home.&nbsp; And since I was going

<BR>home he didn't see why he should. . . .



<P>That was the line of his argument, and it was

<BR>irrelevant enough to be almost insulting.&nbsp; Insult-

<BR>ing to one's intelligence, I mean.



<P>In that twilight region between youth and

<BR>maturity, in which I had my being then, one is

<BR>peculiarly sensitive to that kind of insult.&nbsp; I am

<BR>afraid my behaviour to the Steward became very

<BR>rough indeed.&nbsp; But it wasn't in him to face out

<BR>anything or anybody.&nbsp; Drug habit or solitary

<BR>tippling, perhaps.&nbsp; And when I forgot myself so

<BR>far as to swear at him he broke down and began to

<BR>shriek.



<P>I don't mean to say that he made a great out-

<BR>cry.&nbsp; It was a cynical shrieking confession, only

<BR>faint--piteously faint.&nbsp; It wasn't very coherent

<BR>either, but sufficiently so to strike me dumb at first.

<BR>I turned my eyes from him in righteous indig-

<BR>nation, and perceived Captain Giles in the ve-

<BR>randah doorway surveying quietly the scene, his

<BR>own handiwork, if I may express it in that way.

<BR>His smouldering black pipe was very noticeable

<BR>in his big, paternal fist.&nbsp; So, too, was the glitter of

<BR>his heavy gold watch-chain across the breast of his

<BR>white tunic.&nbsp; He exhaled an atmosphere of virtu-

<BR>ous sagacity serene enough for any innocent soul to

<BR>fly to confidently.&nbsp; I flew to him.



<P>"You would never believe it," I cried.&nbsp; "It was

<BR>a notification that a master is wanted for some

<BR>ship.&nbsp; There's a command apparently going about

<BR>and this fellow puts the thing in his pocket."



<P>The Steward screamed out in accents of loud

<BR>despair: "You will be the death of me!"



<P>The mighty slap he gave his wretched forehead

<BR>was very loud, too.&nbsp; But when I turned to look at

<BR>him he was no longer there.&nbsp; He had rushed away

<BR>somewhere out of sight.&nbsp; This sudden disappear-

<BR>ance made me laugh.



<P>This was the end of the incident--for me.

<BR>Captain Giles, however, staring at the place where

<BR>the Steward had been, began to haul at his gor-

<BR>geous gold chain till at last the watch came up

<BR>from the deep pocket like solid truth from a well.

<BR>Solemnly he lowered it down again and only then

<BR>said:



<P>"Just three o'clock.&nbsp; You will be in time--if

<BR>you don't lose any, that is."



<P>"In time for what?" I asked.



<P>"Good Lord!&nbsp; For the Harbour Office.&nbsp; This

<BR>must be looked into.



<P>Strictly speaking, he was right.&nbsp; But I've never

<BR>had much taste for investigation, for showing

<BR>people up and all that no doubt ethically meri-

<BR>torious kind of work.&nbsp; And my view of the episode

<BR>was purely ethical.&nbsp; If any one had to be the death

<BR>of the Steward I didn't see why it shouldn't be

<BR>Captain Giles himself, a man of age and standing,

<BR>and a permanent resident.&nbsp; Whereas, I in com-

<BR>parison, felt myself a mere bird of passage in that

<BR>port.&nbsp; In fact, it might have been said that I had

<BR>already broken off my connection.&nbsp; I muttered

<BR>that I didn't think--it was nothing to me. . . .



<P>"Nothing!" repeated Captain Giles, giving some

<BR>signs of quiet, deliberate indignation.&nbsp; "Kent

<BR>warned me you were a peculiar young fellow.&nbsp; You

<BR>will tell me next that a command is nothing to you

<BR>--and after all the trouble I've taken, too!"



<P>"The trouble!" I murmured, uncomprehending.

<BR>What trouble?&nbsp; All I could remember was being

<BR>mystified and bored by his conversation for a solid

<BR>hour after tiffin.&nbsp; And he called that taking a lot

<BR>of trouble.



<P>He was looking at me with a self-complacency

<BR>which would have been odious in any other man.

<BR>All at once, as if a page of a book had been turned

<BR>over disclosing a word which made plain all that

<BR>had gone before, I perceived that this matter had

<BR>also another than an ethical aspect.



<P>And still I did not move.&nbsp; Captain Giles lost his

<BR>patience a little.&nbsp; With an angry puff at his pipe he

<BR>turned his back on my hesitation.



<P>But it was not hesitation on my part.&nbsp; I had

<BR>been, if I may express myself so, put out of gear

<BR>mentally.&nbsp; But as soon as I had convinced my-

<BR>self that this stale, unprofitable world of my dis-

<BR>content contained such a thing as a command

<BR>to be seized, I recovered my powers of locomo-

<BR>tion.



<P>It's a good step from the Officers' Home to the

<BR>Harbour Office; but with the magic word "Com-

<BR>mand" in my head I found myself suddenly on

<BR>the quay as if transported there in the twinkling of

<BR>an eye, before a portal of dressed white stone above

<BR>a flight of shallow white steps.



<P>All this seemed to glide toward me swiftly.&nbsp; The

<BR>whole great roadstead to the right was just a mere

<BR>flicker of blue, and the dim cool hall swallowed

<BR>me up out of the heat and glare of which I had not

<BR>been aware till the very moment I passed in from it.



<P>The broad inner staircase insinuated itself under

<BR>my feet somehow.&nbsp; Command is a strong magic.

<BR>The first human beings I perceived distinctly since

<BR>I had parted with the indignant back of Captain

<BR>Giles were the crew of the harbour steam-launch

<BR>lounging on the spacious landing about the cur-

<BR>tained archway of the shipping office.



<P>It was there that my buoyancy abandoned me.

<BR>The atmosphere of officialdom would kill anything

<BR>that breathes the air of human endeavour, would

<BR>extinguish hope and fear alike in the supremacy of

<BR>paper and ink.&nbsp; I passed heavily under the curtain

<BR>which the Malay coxswain of the harbour launch

<BR>raised for me.&nbsp; There was nobody in the office

<BR>except the clerks, writing in two industrious rows.

<BR>But the head Shipping-Master hopped down from

<BR>his elevation and hurried along on the thick mats

<BR>to meet me in the broad central passage.



<P>He had a Scottish name, but his complexion was

<BR>of a rich olive hue, his short beard was jet black,

<BR>and his eyes, also black, had a languishing ex-

<BR>pression.&nbsp; He asked confidentially:



<P>"You want to see Him?"



<P>All lightness of spirit and body having departed

<BR>from me at the touch of officialdom, I looked at

<BR>the scribe without animation and asked in my turn

<BR>wearily:



<P>"What do you think?&nbsp; Is it any use?"



<P>"My goodness!&nbsp; He has asked for you twice to-

<BR>day."



<P>This emphatic He was the supreme authority,

<BR>the Marine Superintendent, the Harbour-Master

<BR>--a very great person in the eyes of every single

<BR>quill-driver in the room.&nbsp; But that was nothing to

<BR>the opinion he had of his own greatness.



<P>Captain Ellis looked upon himself as a sort of

<BR>divine (pagan) emanation, the deputy-Neptune for

<BR>the circumambient seas.&nbsp; If he did not actually

<BR>rule the waves, he pretended to rule the fate of

<BR>the mortals whose lives were cast upon the

<BR>waters.



<P>This uplifting illusion made him inquisitorial

<BR>and peremptory.&nbsp; And as his temperament was

<BR>choleric there were fellows who were actually afraid

<BR>of him.&nbsp; He was redoubtable, not in virtue of his

<BR>office, but because of his unwarrantable assump-

<BR>tions.&nbsp; I had never had anything to do with him

<BR>before.



<P>I said: "Oh!&nbsp; He has asked for me twice.&nbsp; Then

<BR>perhaps I had better go in."



<P>"You must!&nbsp; You must!"



<P>The Shipping-Master led the way with a mincing

<BR>gait around the whole system of desks to a tall and

<BR>important-looking door, which he opened with a

<BR>deferential action of the arm.



<P>He stepped right in (but without letting go of

<BR>the handle) and, after gazing reverently down the

<BR>room for a while, beckoned me in by a silent jerk

<BR>of the head.&nbsp; Then he slipped out at once and shut

<BR>the door after me most delicately.



<P>Three lofty windows gave on the harbour.

<BR>There was nothing in them but the dark-blue

<BR>sparkling sea and the paler luminous blue of the

<BR>sky.&nbsp; My eye caught in the depths and distances

<BR>of these blue tones the white speck of some big ship

<BR>just arrived and about to anchor in the outer road-

<BR>stead.&nbsp; A ship from home--after perhaps ninety

<BR>days at sea.&nbsp; There is something touching about a

<BR>ship coming in from sea and folding her white

<BR>wings for a rest.



<P>The next thing I saw was the top-knot of silver

<BR>hair surmounting Captain Ellis' smooth red face,

<BR>which would have been apoplectic if it hadn't had

<BR>such a fresh appearance.



<P>Our deputy-Neptune had no beard on his chin,

<BR>and there was no trident to be seen standing in a

<BR>corner anywhere, like an umbrella.&nbsp; But his hand

<BR>was holding a pen--the official pen, far mightier

<BR>than the sword in making or marring the fortune of

<BR>simple toiling men.&nbsp; He was looking over his

<BR>shoulder at my advance.



<P>When I had come well within range he saluted

<BR>me by a nerve-shattering: "Where have you been

<BR>all this time?"



<P>As it was no concern of his I did not take the

<BR>slightest notice of the shot.&nbsp; I said simply that I

<BR>had heard there was a master needed for some

<BR>vessel, and being a sailing-ship man I thought I

<BR>would apply. . . .



<P>He interrupted me.&nbsp; "Why!&nbsp; Hang it!&nbsp; YOU are

<BR>the right man for that job--if there had been

<BR>twenty others after it.&nbsp; But no fear of that.&nbsp; They

<BR>are all afraid to catch hold.&nbsp; That's what's the

<BR>matter."



<P>He was very irritated.&nbsp; I said innocently: "Are

<BR>they, sir.&nbsp; I wonder why?"



<P>"Why!" he fumed.&nbsp; "Afraid of the sails.

<BR>Afraid of a white crew.&nbsp; Too much trouble.&nbsp; Too

<BR>much work.&nbsp; Too long out here.&nbsp; Easy life and

<BR>deck-chairs more their mark.&nbsp; Here I sit with the

<BR>Consul-General's cable before me, and the only

<BR>man fit for the job not to be found anywhere.&nbsp; I

<BR>began to think you were funking it, too. . . ."



<P>"I haven't been long getting to the office," I

<BR>remarked calmly.



<P>"You have a good name out here, though," he

<BR>growled savagely without looking at me.



<P>"I am very glad to hear it from you, sir," I said.



<P>"Yes.&nbsp; But you are not on the spot when you

<BR>are wanted.&nbsp; You know you weren't.&nbsp; That stew-

<BR>ard of yours wouldn't dare to neglect a message

<BR>from this office.&nbsp; Where the devil did you hide

<BR>yourself for the best part of the day?"



<P>I only smiled kindly down on him, and he seemed

<BR>to recollect himself, and asked me to take a seat.&nbsp; He

<BR>explained that the master of a British ship having

<BR>died in Bangkok the Consul-General had cabled to

<BR>him a request for a competent man to be sent out to

<BR>take command.



<P>Apparently, in his mind, I was the man from the

<BR>first, though for the looks of the thing the notifica-

<BR>tion addressed to the Sailors' Home was general.

<BR>An agreement had already been prepared.&nbsp; He

<BR>gave it to me to read, and when I handed it back to

<BR>him with the remark that I accepted its terms, the

<BR>deputy-Neptune signed it, stamped it with his own

<BR>exalted hand, folded it in four (it was a sheet of

<BR>blue foolscap) and presented it to me--a gift of ex-

<BR>traordinary potency, for, as I put it in my pocket,

<BR>my head swam a little.



<P>"This is your appointment to the command," he

<BR>said with a certain gravity.&nbsp; "An official appoint-

<BR>ment binding the owners to conditions which you

<BR>have accepted.&nbsp; Now--when will you be ready to

<BR>go?"



<P>I said I would be ready that very day if neces-

<BR>sary.&nbsp; He caught me at my word with great

<BR>alacrity.&nbsp; The steamer Melita was leaving for

<BR>Bangkok that evening about seven.&nbsp; He would

<BR>request her captain officially to give me a passage

<BR>and wait for me till ten o'clock.



<P>Then he rose from his office chair, and I got up,

<BR>too.&nbsp; My head swam, there was no doubt about it,

<BR>and I felt a certain heaviness of limbs as if they

<BR>had grown bigger since I had sat down on that

<BR>chair.&nbsp; I made my bow.



<P>A subtle change in Captain Ellis' manner became

<BR>perceptible as though he had laid aside the trident

<BR>of deputy-Neptune.&nbsp; In reality, it was only his

<BR>official pen that he had dropped on getting up.
