<P>Then said Diabolus, 'O ye stout Diabolonians, be it known



<P>unto you, that there is treachery hatched against us in the



<P>rebellious town of Mansoul; for albeit the town is in our



<P>possession, as you see, yet these miserable Mansoulians have



<P>attempted to dare, and have been so hardy as yet to send to



<P>the court to Emmanuel for help.&nbsp; This I give you to



<P>understand, that ye may yet know how to carry it to the



<P>wretched town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Wherefore, O my trusty



<P>Diabolonians, I command that yet more and more ye distress



<P>this town of Mansoul, and vex it with your wiles, ravish



<P>their women, deflower their virgins, slay their children,



<P>brain their ancients, fire their town, and what other



<P>mischief you can; and let this be the reward of the



<P>Mansoulians from me, for their desperate rebellions against



<P>me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This, you see, was the charge; but something stepped in



<P>betwixt that and execution, for as yet there was but little



<P>more done than to rage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Moreover, when Diabolus had done thus, he went the next way



<P>up to the castle gates, and demanded that, upon pain of



<P>death, the gates should be opened to him, and that entrance



<P>should be given him and his men that followed after.&nbsp; To whom



<P>Mr. Godly-Fear replied, (for he it was that had the charge of



<P>that gate,) that the gate should not be opened unto him, nor



<P>to the men that followed after him.&nbsp; He said, moreover, that



<P>Mansoul, when she had suffered awhile, should be made



<P>perfect, strengthened, settled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Diabolus, 'Deliver me, then, the men that have



<P>petitioned against me, especially Captain Credence, that



<P>carried it to your Prince; deliver that varlet into my hands,



<P>and I will depart from the town.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then up starts a Diabolonian, whose name was Mr. Fooling, and



<P>said, 'My lord offereth you fair: it is better for you that



<P>one man perish, than that your whole Mansoul should be



<P>undone.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Mr. Godly-Fear made him this replication, 'How long will



<P>Mansoul be kept out of the dungeon, when she hath given up



<P>her faith to Diabolus!&nbsp; As good lose the town, as lose



<P>Captain Credence; for if one be gone the other must follow.'



<P>But to that Mr. Fooling said nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then did my Lord Mayor reply, and said, 'O thou devouring



<P>tyrant, be it known unto thee, we shall hearken to none of



<P>thy words; we are resolved to resist thee as long as a



<P>captain, a man, a sling, and a stone to throw at thee shall



<P>be found in the town of Mansoul.'&nbsp; But Diabolus answered, 'Do



<P>you hope, do you wait, do you look for help and deliverance?



<P>You have sent to Emmanuel, but your wickedness sticks too



<P>close in your skirts, to let innocent prayers come out of



<P>your lips.&nbsp; Think you that you shall be prevailers and



<P>prosper in this design?&nbsp; You will fail in your wish, you will



<P>fail in your attempts; for it is not only I, but your



<P>Emmanuel is against you: yea, it is he that hath sent me



<P>against you to subdue you.&nbsp; For what, then, do you hope? or



<P>by what means will you escape?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Lord Mayor, 'We have sinned indeed; but that



<P>shall be no help to thee, for our Emmanuel hath said it, and



<P>that in great faithfulness, "and him that cometh to me I will



<P>in no wise cast out."&nbsp; He hath also told us, O our enemy,



<P>that "all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven" to



<P>the sons of men.&nbsp; Therefore we dare not despair, but will



<P>look for, wait for, and hope for deliverance still.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, by this time, Captain Credence was returned and come



<P>from the court from Emmanuel to the castle of Mansoul, and he



<P>returned to them with a packet.&nbsp; So my Lord Mayor, hearing



<P>that Captain Credence was come, withdrew himself from the



<P>noise of the roaring of the tyrant, and left him to yell at



<P>the wall of the town, or against the gates of the castle.&nbsp; So



<P>he came up to the captain's lodgings, and saluting him, he



<P>asked him of his welfare, and what was the best news at



<P>court.&nbsp; But when he asked Captain Credence that, the water



<P>stood in his eyes.&nbsp; Then said the captain, 'Cheer up, my



<P>lord, for all will be well in time.'&nbsp; And with that he first



<P>produced his packet, and laid it by; but that the Lord Mayor,



<P>and the rest of the captains, took for sign of good tidings.



<P>Now a season of grace being come, he sent for all the



<P>captains and elders of the town, that were here and there in



<P>their lodgings in the castle and upon their guard, to let



<P>them know that Captain Credence was returned from the court,



<P>and that he had something in general, and something in



<P>special, to communicate to them.&nbsp; So they all came up to him,



<P>and saluted him, and asked him concerning his journey, and



<P>what was the best news at the court.&nbsp; And he answered them as



<P>he had done the Lord Mayor before, that all would be well at



<P>last.&nbsp; Now, when the captain had thus saluted them, he opened



<P>his packet, and thence did draw out his several notes for



<P>those that he had sent for.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And the first note was for my Lord Mayor, wherein was



<P>signified:- That the Prince Emmanuel had taken it well that



<P>my Lord Mayor had been so true and trusty in his office, and



<P>the great concerns that lay upon him for the town and people



<P>of Mansoul.&nbsp; Also, he bid him to know, that he took it well



<P>that he had been so bold for his Prince Emmanuel, and had



<P>engaged so faithfully in his cause against Diabolus.&nbsp; He also



<P>signified, at the close of his letter, that he should shortly



<P>receive his reward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The second note that came out, was for the noble Lord



<P>Willbewill, wherein there was signified:- That his Prince



<P>Emmanuel did well understand how valiant and courageous he



<P>had been for the honour of his Lord, now in his absence, and



<P>when his name was under contempt by Diabolus.&nbsp; There was



<P>signified also, that his Prince had taken it well that he had



<P>been so faithful to the town of Mansoul, in his keeping of so



<P>strict a hand and eye over and so strict a rein upon the neck



<P>of the Diabolonians, that did still lie lurking in their



<P>several holes in the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; He signified,



<P>moreover, how that he understood that my Lord had, with his



<P>own hand, done great execution upon some of the chief of the



<P>rebels there, to the great discouragement of the adverse



<P>party and to the good example of the whole town of Mansoul;



<P>and that shortly his lordship should have his reward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The third note came out for the subordinate preacher, wherein



<P>was signified:- That his Prince took it well from him, that



<P>he had so honestly and so faithfully performed his office,



<P>and executed the trust committed to him by his Lord, while he



<P>exhorted, rebuked, and forewarned Mansoul according to the



<P>laws of the town.&nbsp; He signified, moreover, that he took it



<P>well at his hand that he called to fasting, to sackcloth, and



<P>ashes, when Mansoul was under her revolt.&nbsp; Also, that he



<P>called for the aid of the Captain Boanerges to help in so



<P>weighty a work; and that shortly he also should receive his



<P>reward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The fourth note came out for Mr. Godly-Fear, wherein his Lord



<P>thus signified:- That his Lordship observed, that he was the



<P>first of all the men in Mansoul that detected Mr. Carnal-



<P>Security as the only one that, through his subtlety and



<P>cunning, had obtained for Diabolus a defection and decay of



<P>goodness in the blessed town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Moreover, his Lord



<P>gave him to understand, that he still remembered his tears



<P>and mourning for the state of Mansoul.&nbsp; It was also observed,



<P>by the same note, that his Lord took notice of his detecting



<P>of this Mr. Carnal-Security, at his own table among his



<P>guests, in his own house, and that in the midst of his



<P>jolliness, even while he was seeking to perfect his villanies



<P>against the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Emmanuel also took notice that



<P>this reverend person, Mr. Godly-Fear, stood stoutly to it, at



<P>the gates of the castle, against all the threats and attempts



<P>of the tyrant; and that he had put the townsmen in a way to



<P>make their petition to their Prince, so as that he might



<P>accept thereof, and as they might obtain an answer of peace;



<P>and that therefore shortly he should receive his reward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After all this, there was yet produced a note which was



<P>written to the whole town of Mansoul, whereby they perceived



<P>- That their Lord took notice of their so often repeating of



<P>petitions to him; and that they should see more of the fruits



<P>of such their doings in time to come.&nbsp; Their Prince did also



<P>therein tell them, that he took it well, that their heart and



<P>mind, now at last, abode fixed upon him and his ways, though



<P>Diabolus had made such inroads upon them; and that neither



<P>flatteries on the one hand, nor hardships on the other, could



<P>make them yield to serve his cruel designs.&nbsp; There was also



<P>inserted at the bottom of this note - That his Lordship had



<P>left the town of Mansoul in the hands of the Lord Secretary,



<P>and under the conduct of Captain Credence, saying, 'Beware



<P>that you yet yield yourselves unto their governance; and in



<P>due time you shall receive your reward.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So, after the brave Captain Credence had delivered his notes



<P>to those to whom they belonged, he retired himself to my Lord



<P>Secretary's lodgings, and there spends time in conversing



<P>with him; for they too were very great one with another, and



<P>did indeed know more how things would go with Mansoul than



<P>did all the townsmen besides.&nbsp; The Lord Secretary also loved



<P>the Captain Credence dearly; yea, many a good bit was sent



<P>him from my Lord's table; also, he might have a show of



<P>countenance, when the rest of Mansoul lay under the clouds:



<P>so, after some time for converse was spent, the captain



<P>betook himself to his chambers to rest.&nbsp; But it was not long



<P>after when my Lord did send for the captain again; so the



<P>captain came to him, and they greeted one another with usual



<P>salutations.&nbsp; Then said the captain to the Lord Secretary,



<P>'What hath my Lord to say to his servant?'&nbsp; So the Lord



<P>Secretary took him and had him aside, and after a sign or two



<P>of more favour, he said, 'I have made thee the Lord's



<P>lieutenant over all the forces in Mansoul; so that, from this



<P>day forward, all men in Mansoul shall be at thy word; and



<P>thou shalt be he that shall lead in, and that shall lead out



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; Thou shalt therefore manage, according to thy



<P>place, the war for thy Prince, and for the town of Mansoul,



<P>against the force and power of Diabolus; and at thy command



<P>shall the rest of the captains be.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now the townsmen began to perceive what interest the captain



<P>had, both with the court, and also with the Lord Secretary in



<P>Mansoul; for no man before could speed when sent, nor bring



<P>such good news from Emmanuel as he.&nbsp; Wherefore what do they,



<P>after some lamentation that they made no more use of him in



<P>their distresses, but send by their subordinate preacher to



<P>the Lord Secretary, to desire him that all that ever they



<P>were and had might be put under the government, care,



<P>custody, and conduct of Captain Credence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So their preacher went and did his errand, and received this



<P>answer from the mouth of his Lord: that Captain Credence



<P>should be the great doer in all the King's army, against the



<P>King's enemies, and also for the welfare of Mansoul.&nbsp; So he



<P>bowed to the ground, and thanked his Lordship, and returned



<P>and told his news to the townsfolk.&nbsp; But all this was done



<P>with all imaginable secrecy, because the foes had yet great



<P>strength in the town.&nbsp; But to return to our story again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Diabolus saw himself thus boldly confronted by the Lord



<P>Mayor, and perceived the stoutness of Mr. Godly-Fear, he fell



<P>into a rage, and forthwith called a council of war, that he



<P>might be revenged on Mansoul.&nbsp; So all the princes of the pit



<P>came together, and old Incredulity at the head of them, with



<P>all the captains of his army.&nbsp; So they consult what to do.



<P>Now the effect and conclusion of the council that day was how



<P>they might take the castle, because they could not conclude



<P>themselves masters of the town so long as that was in the



<P>possession of their enemies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So one advised this way, and another advised that; but when



<P>they could not agree in their verdict, Apollyon, that



<P>president of the council, stood up, and thus he began: 'My



<P>brotherhood,' quoth he, 'I have two things to propound unto



<P>you; and my first is this.&nbsp; Let us withdraw ourselves from



<P>the town into the plain again, for our presence here will do



<P>us no good, because the castle is yet in our enemies' hands;



<P>nor is it possible that we should take that, so long as so



<P>many brave captains are in it, and that this bold fellow,



<P>Godly-Fear, is made the keeper of the gates of it.&nbsp; Now, when



<P>we have withdrawn ourselves into the plain, they, of their



<P>own accord, will be glad of some little ease; and it may be,



<P>of their own accord, they again may begin to be remiss, and



<P>even their so being will give them a bigger blow than we can



<P>possibly give them ourselves.&nbsp; But if that should fail, our



<P>going forth of the town may draw the captains out after us;



<P>and you know what it cost them when we fought them in the



<P>field before.&nbsp; Besides, can we but draw them out into the



<P>field, we may lay an ambush behind the town, which shall,



<P>when they are come forth abroad, rush in and take possession



<P>of the castle.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Beelzebub stood up, and replied, saying: 'It is



<P>impossible to draw them all off from the castle; some, you



<P>may be sure, will lie there to keep that; wherefore it will



<P>be but in vain thus to attempt, unless we were sure that they



<P>will all come out.'&nbsp; He therefore concluded that what was



<P>done must be done by some other means.&nbsp; And the most likely



<P>means that the greatest of their heads could invent, was that



<P>which Apollyon had advised to before, namely, to get the



<P>townsmen again to sin.&nbsp; 'For,' said he, 'it is not our being



<P>in the town, nor in the field, nor our fighting, nor our



<P>killing of their men, that can make us the masters of



<P>Mansoul; for so long as one in the town is able to lift up



<P>his finger against us, Emmanuel will take their parts; and if



<P>he shall take their parts, we know what time of day it will



<P>be with us.&nbsp; Wherefore, for my part,' quoth he, 'there is, in



<P>my judgment, no way to bring them into bondage to us, like



<P>inventing a way to make them sin.&nbsp; Had we,' said he, 'left



<P>all our doubters at home, we had done as well as we have done



<P>now, unless we could have made them the masters and governors



<P>of the castle; for doubters at a distance are but like



<P>objections refelled with arguments.&nbsp; Indeed, can we but get



<P>them into the hold, and make them possessors of that, the day



<P>will be our own.&nbsp; Let us, therefore, withdraw ourselves into



<P>the plain, (not expecting that the captains in Mansoul should



<P>follow us,) but yet, I say, let us do this, and before we so



<P>do, let us advise again with our trusty Diabolonians that are



<P>yet in their holds of Mansoul, and set them to work to betray



<P>the town to us; for they indeed must do it, or it will be



<P>left undone for ever.'&nbsp; By these sayings of Beelzebub, (for I



<P>think it was he that gave this counsel,) the whole conclave



<P>was forced to be of his opinion, namely, that the way to get



<P>the castle was to get the town to sin.&nbsp; Then they fell to



<P>inventing by what means they might do this thing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then Lucifer stood up, and said: 'The counsel of Beelzebub is



<P>pertinent.&nbsp; Now, the way to bring this to pass, in mine



<P>opinion, is this: let us withdraw our force from the town of



<P>Mansoul; let us do this, and let us terrify them no more,



<P>either with summons, or threats, or with the noise of our



<P>drum, or any other awakening means.&nbsp; Only let us lie in the



<P>field at a distance, and be as if we regarded them not; for



<P>frights, I see, do but awaken them, and make them more stand



<P>to their arms.&nbsp; I have also another stratagem in my head: you



<P>know Mansoul is a market-town, and a town that delights in



<P>commerce; what, therefore, if some of our Diabolonians shall



<P>feign themselves far-country men, and shall go out and bring



<P>to the market of Mansoul some of our wares to sell; and what



<P>matter at what rates they sell their wares, though it be but



<P>for half the worth?&nbsp; Now, let those that thus shall trade in



<P>their market be those that are witty and true to us, and I



<P>will lay my crown to pawn it will do.&nbsp; There are two that are



<P>come to my thoughts already, that I think will be arch at



<P>this work, and they are Mr. Penny-wise-pound-foolish, and Mr.



<P>Get-i'the-hundred-and-lose-i'the-shire; nor is this man with



<P>the long name at all inferior to the other.&nbsp; What, also, if



<P>you join with them Mr. Sweet-world and Mr. Present-good; they



<P>are men that are civil and cunning, but our true friends and



<P>helpers.&nbsp; Let these, with as many more, engage in this



<P>business for us, and let Mansoul be taken up in much



<P>business, and let them grow full and rich, and this is the



<P>way to get ground of them.&nbsp; Remember ye not that thus we



<P>prevailed upon Laodicea, and how many at present do we hold



<P>in this snare?&nbsp; Now, when they begin to grow full, they will



<P>forget their misery; and if we shall not affright them, they



<P>may happen to fall asleep, and so be got to neglect their



<P>town watch, their castle watch, as well as their watch at the



<P>gates.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yea, may we not, by this means, so cumber Mansoul with



<P>abundance, that they shall be forced to make of their castle



<P>a warehouse, instead of a garrison fortified against us, and



<P>a receptacle for men of war.&nbsp; Thus, if we get our goods and



<P>commodities thither, I reckon that the castle is more than



<P>half ours.&nbsp; Besides, could we so order it that it shall be



<P>filled with such kind of wares, then if we made a sudden



<P>assault upon them, it would be hard for the captains to take



<P>shelter there.&nbsp; Do you not know that of the parable, "The



<P>deceitfulness of riches choke the word"? and again, "When the



<P>heart is over-charged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and



<P>the cares of this life," all mischief comes upon them at



<P>unawares?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Furthermore, my lords,' quoth he, 'you very well know that



<P>it is not easy for a people to be filled with our things, and



<P>not to have some of our Diabolonians as retainers to their



<P>houses and services.&nbsp; Where is a Mansoulian that is full of



<P>this world, that has not for his servants and waiting-men,



<P>Mr. Profuse, or Mr. Prodigality, or some other of our



<P>Diabolonian gang, as Mr. Voluptuous, Mr. Pragmatical, Mr.



<P>Ostentation, or the like?&nbsp; Now these can take the castle of



<P>Mansoul, or blow it up, or make it unfit for a garrison for



<P>Emmanuel, and any of these will do.&nbsp; Yea, these, for aught I



<P>know, may do it for us sooner than an army of twenty thousand



<P>men.&nbsp; Wherefore, to end as I began, my advice is, that we



<P>quietly withdraw ourselves, not offering any further force,



<P>or forcible attempts, upon the castle, at least at this time;



<P>and let us set on foot our new project, and let us see if



<P>that will not make them destroy themselves.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This advice was highly applauded by them all, and was



<P>accounted the very masterpiece of hell, namely, to choke



<P>Mansoul with a fulness of this world, and to surfeit her



<P>heart with the good things thereof.&nbsp; But see how things meet



<P>together!&nbsp; Just as this Diabolonian council was broken up,



<P>Captain Credence received a letter from Emmanuel, the



<P>contents of which were these: That upon the third day he



<P>would meet him in the field in the plains about Mansoul.



<P>'Meet me in the field!' quoth the Captain; 'what meaneth my



<P>lord by this?&nbsp; I know not what he meaneth by meeting me in



<P>the field.'&nbsp; So he took the note in his hand, and did carry



<P>it to my Lord Secretary, to ask his thoughts thereupon; for



<P>my Lord was a seer in all matters concerning the King, and



<P>also for the good and comfort of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; So he



<P>showed my Lord the note, and desired his opinion thereof.



<P>'For my part,' quoth Captain Credence, 'I know not the



<P>meaning thereof.'&nbsp; So my lord did take and read it and, after



<P>a little pause, he said, 'The Diabolonians have had against



<P>Mansoul a great consultation to-day; they have, I say, this



<P>day been contriving the utter ruin of the town; and the



<P>result of their council is, to set Mansoul into such a way



<P>which, if taken, will surely make her destroy herself.&nbsp; And,



<P>to this end, they are making ready for their own departure



<P>out of the town, intending to betake themselves to the field



<P>again,' and there to lie till they shall see whether this



<P>their project will take or no.&nbsp; But be thou ready with the



<P>men of thy Lord, (for on the third day they will be in the



<P>plain,) there to fall upon the Diabolonians; for the Prince



<P>will by that time be in the field; yea, by that it is break



<P>of day, sun-rising, or before, and that with a mighty force



<P>against them.&nbsp; So he shall be before them, and thou shalt be



<P>behind them, and betwixt you both their army shall be



<P>destroyed.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Captain Credence heard this, away goes he to the rest of



<P>the captains, and tells them what a note he had a while since



<P>received from the hand of Emmanuel.&nbsp; 'And,' said he, 'that



<P>which was dark therein hath my lord the Lord Secretary



<P>expounded unto me.'&nbsp; He told them, moreover, what by himself



<P>and by them must be done to answer the mind of their Lord.



<P>Then were the captains glad; and Captain Credence commanded



<P>that all the King's trumpeters should ascend to the



<P>battlements of the castle, and there, in the audience of



<P>Diabolus and of the whole town of Mansoul, make the best



<P>music that heart could invent.&nbsp; The trumpeters then did as



<P>they were commanded.&nbsp; They got themselves up to the top of



<P>the castle, and thus they began to sound.&nbsp; Then did Diabolus



<P>start, and said, 'What can be the meaning of this? they



<P>neither sound Boot-and-saddle, nor Horse-and-away, nor a



<P>charge.&nbsp; What do these madmen mean that yet they should be so



<P>merry and glad?'&nbsp; Then answered one of themselves and said,



<P>'This is for joy that their Prince Emmanuel is coming to



<P>relieve the town of Mansoul; and to this end he is at the



<P>head of an army, and that this relief is near.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The men of Mansoul also were greatly concerned at this



<P>melodious charm of the trumpets; they said, yea, they



<P>answered one another, saying, 'This can be no harm to us;



<P>surely this can be no harm to us.'&nbsp; Then said the



<P>Diabolonians, 'What had we best to do?' and it was answered,



<P>'It was best to quit the town;' and 'that,' said one, 'ye may



<P>do in pursuance of your last counsel, and by so doing also be



<P>better able to give the enemy battle, should an army from



<P>without come upon us.&nbsp; So, on the second day, they withdrew



<P>themselves from Mansoul, and abode in the plains without; but



<P>they encamped themselves before Eye-gate, in what terrene and



<P>terrible manner they could.&nbsp; The reason why they would not



<P>abide in the town (besides the reasons that were debated in



<P>their late conclave) was, for that they were not possessed of



<P>the stronghold, and 'because,' said they, 'we shall have more



<P>convenience to fight, and also to fly, if need be, when we



<P>are encamped in the open plains.'&nbsp; Besides, the town would



<P>have been a pit for them rather than a place of defence, had



<P>the Prince come up and inclosed them fast therein.&nbsp; Therefore



<P>they betook themselves to the field, that they might also be



<P>out of the reach of the slings, by which they were much



<P>annoyed all the while that they were in the town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, the time that the captains were to fall upon the



<P>Diabolonians being come, they eagerly prepared themselves for



<P>action; for Captain Credence had told the captains over



<P>night, that they should meet their Prince in the field to-



<P>morrow.&nbsp; This, therefore, made them yet far more desirous to



<P>be engaging the enemy; for 'You shall see the Prince in the



<P>field to-morrow' was like oil to a flaming fire, for of a



<P>long time they had been at a distance: they therefore were



<P>for this the more earnest and desirous of the work.&nbsp; So, as I



<P>said, the hour being come, Captain Credence, with the rest of



<P>the men of war, drew out their forces before it was day by



<P>the sally-port of the town.&nbsp; And, being all ready, Captain



<P>Credence went up to the head of the army, and gave to the



<P>rest of the captains the word, and so they to their under-



<P>officers and soldiers: the word was 'The sword of the Prince



<P>Emmanuel, and the shield of Captain Credence;' which is, in



<P>the Mansoulian tongue, 'The word of God and faith.'&nbsp; Then the



<P>captains fell on, and began roundly to front, and flank, and



<P>rear Diabolus's camp.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, they left Captain Experience in the town, because he was



<P>yet ill of his wounds, which the Diabolonians had given him



<P>in the last fight.&nbsp; But when he perceived that the captains



<P>were at it, what does he but, calling for his crutches with



<P>haste, gets up, and away he goes to the battle, saying,



<P>'Shall I lie here, when my brethren are in the fight, and



<P>when Emmanuel, the Prince, will show himself in the field to



<P>his servants?'&nbsp; But when the enemy saw the man come with his



<P>crutches, they were daunted yet the more; 'for,' thought



<P>they, 'what spirit has possessed these Mansoulians, that they



<P>fight us upon their crutches?'&nbsp; Well, the captains, as I



<P>said, fell on, and did bravely handle their weapons, still



<P>crying out and shouting, as they laid on blows, 'The sword of



<P>the Prince Emmanuel, and the shield of Captain Credence!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when Diabolus saw that the captains were come out, and



<P>that so valiantly they surrounded his men, he concluded that,



<P>for the present, nothing from them was to be looked for but



<P>blows, and the dints of their 'two-edged sword.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wherefore he also falls on upon the Prince's army with all



<P>his deadly force: so the battle was joined.&nbsp; Now who was it



<P>that at first Diabolus met with in the fight, but Captain



<P>Credence on the one hand, and the Lord Willbewill on the



<P>other: now Willbewill's blows were like the blows of a giant,



<P>for that man had a strong arm, and he fell in upon the



<P>election doubters, for they were the life-guard of Diabolus,



<P>and he kept them in play a good while, cutting and battering



<P>shrewdly.&nbsp; Now when Captain Credence saw my lord engaged, he



<P>did stoutly fall on, on the other hand, upon the same company



<P>also; so they put them to great disorder.&nbsp; Now Captain Good-



<P>Hope had engaged the vocation doubters, and they were sturdy



<P>men; but the captain was a valiant man: Captain Experience



<P>did also send him some aid; so he made the vocation doubters



<P>to retreat.&nbsp; The rest of the armies were hotly engaged, and



<P>that on every side, and the Diabolonians did fight stoutly.



<P>Then did my Lord Secretary command that the slings from the



<P>castle should be played; and his men could throw stones at an



<P>hair's breadth.&nbsp; But, after a while, those that were made to



<P>fly before the captains of the Prince, did begin to rally



<P>again, and they came up stoutly upon the rear of the Prince's



<P>army: wherefore the Prince's army began to faint; but,



<P>remembering that they should see the face of their Prince by-



<P>and-by, they took courage, and a very fierce battle was



<P>fought.&nbsp; Then shouted the captains, saying, 'The sword of the



<P>Prince Emmanuel, and the shield of Captain Credence!' and



<P>with that Diabolus gave back, thinking that more aid had been



<P>come.&nbsp; But no Emmanuel as yet appeared.&nbsp; Moreover, the battle



<P>did hang in doubt; and they made a little retreat on both



<P>sides.&nbsp; Now, in the time of respite, Captain Credence bravely



<P>encouraged his men to stand to it; and Diabolus did the like,



<P>as well as he could.&nbsp; But Captain Credence made a brave



<P>speech to his soldiers, the contents whereof here follow:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Gentlemen soldiers, and my brethren in this design, it



<P>rejoiceth me much to see in the field for our Prince, this



<P>day, so stout and so valiant an army, and such faithful



<P>lovers of Mansoul.&nbsp; You have hitherto, as hath become you,



<P>shown yourselves men of truth and courage against the



<P>Diabolonian forces; so that, for all their boast, they have



<P>not yet much cause to boast of their gettings.&nbsp; Now take to



<P>yourselves your wonted courage, and show yourselves men even



<P>this once only; for in a few minutes after the next



<P>engagement, this time, you shall see your Prince show himself



<P>in the field; for we must make this second assault upon this



<P>tyrant Diabolus, and then Emmanuel comes.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No sooner had the captain made this speech to his soldiers,



<P>but one Mr. Speedy came post to the captain from the Prince,



<P>to tell him that Emmanuel was at hand.&nbsp; This news when the



<P>captain had received, he communicated to the other field-



<P>officers, and they again to their soldiers and men of war.



<P>Wherefore, like men raised from the dead, so the captains and



<P>their men arose, made up to the enemy, and cried as before,



<P>'The sword of the Prince Emmanuel, and the shield of Captain



<P>Credence!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Diabolonians also bestirred themselves, and made



<P>resistance as well as they could; but in this last engagement



<P>the Diabolonians lost their courage, and many of the doubters



<P>fell down dead to the ground.&nbsp; Now, when they had been in



<P>heat of battle about an hour or more, Captain Credence lift



<P>up his eyes and saw, and, behold, Emmanuel came; and he came



<P>with colours flying, trumpets sounding, and the feet of his



<P>men scarce touched the ground, they hasted with that celerity



<P>towards the captains that were engaged.&nbsp; Then did Credence



<P>wind with his men to the townward, and gave to Diabolus the



<P>field: so Emmanuel came upon him on the one side, and the



<P>enemies' place was betwixt them both.&nbsp; Then again they fell



<P>to it afresh; and now it was but a little while more but



<P>Emmanuel and Captain Credence met, still trampling down the



<P>slain as they came.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But when the captains saw that the Prince was come, and that



<P>he fell upon the Diabolonians on the other side, and that



<P>Captain Credence and his Highness had got them up betwixt



<P>them, they shouted, (they so shouted that the ground rent



<P>again,) saying, 'The sword of Emmanuel, and the shield of



<P>Captain Credence!'&nbsp; Now, when Diabolus saw that he and his



<P>forces were so hard beset by the Prince and his princely



<P>army, what does he, and the lords of the pit that were with



<P>him, but make their escape, and forsake their army, and leave



<P>them to fall by the hand of Emmanuel, and of his noble



<P>Captain Credence: so they fell all down slain before them,



<P>before the Prince, and before his royal army; there was not



<P>left so much as one doubter alive; they lay spread upon the



<P>ground dead men, as one would spread dung upon the land.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the battle was over, all things came into order in the



<P>camp.&nbsp; Then the captains and elders of Mansoul came together



<P>to salute Emmanuel, while without the corporation: so they



<P>saluted him, and welcomed him, and that with a thousand



<P>welcomes, for that he was come to the borders of Mansoul



<P>again.&nbsp; So he smiled upon them, and said, 'Peace be to you.'



<P>Then they addressed themselves to go to the town; they went



<P>then to go up to Mansoul, they, the Prince, with all the new



<P>forces that now he had brought with him to the war.&nbsp; Also all



<P>the gates of the town were set open for his reception, so



<P>glad were they of his blessed return.&nbsp; And this was the



<P>manner and order of this going of his into Mansoul:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>First.&nbsp; As I said, all the gates of the town were set open,



<P>yea, the gates of the castle also; the elders, too, of the



<P>town of Mansoul placed themselves at the gates of the town,



<P>to salute him at his entrance thither: and so they did; for,



<P>as he drew near, and approached towards the gates, they said,



<P>'Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye



<P>everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.'&nbsp; And



<P>they answered again, 'Who is the King of glory?' and they



<P>made return to themselves, 'The Lord, strong and mighty; the



<P>Lord mighty in battle.&nbsp; Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even



<P>lift them up, ye everlasting doors,' etc.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Secondly.&nbsp; It was ordered also, by those of Mansoul, that all



<P>the way from the town gates to those of the castle, his



<P>blessed Majesty should be entertained with the song, by them



<P>that had the best skill in music in all the town of Mansoul:



<P>then did the elders, and the rest of the men of Mansoul,



<P>answer one another as Emmanuel entered the town, till he came



<P>at the castle gates, with songs and sound of trumpets,



<P>saying, 'They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of



<P>my God, my King, in the sanctuary.&nbsp; So the singers went



<P>before, the players on instruments followed after, and among



<P>them were the damsels playing on timbrels.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thirdly.&nbsp; Then the captains, (for I would speak a word of



<P>them,) they in their order waited on the Prince, as he



<P>entered into the gates of Mansoul.&nbsp; Captain Credence went



<P>before, and Captain Good-Hope with him; Captain Charity came



<P>behind with other of his companions, and Captain Patience



<P>followed after all; and the rest of the captains, some on the



<P>right hand, and some on the left, accompanied Emmanuel into



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; And all the while the colours were displayed, the



<P>trumpets sounded, and continual shoutings were among the



<P>soldiers.&nbsp; The Prince himself rode into the town in his



<P>armour, which was all of beaten gold, and in his chariot -



<P>the pillars of it were of silver, the bottom thereof of gold,



<P>the covering of it was of purple, the midst thereof being



<P>paved with love for the daughters of the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fourthly.&nbsp; When the Prince was come to the entrance of



<P>Mansoul, he found all the streets strewed with lilies and



<P>flowers, curiously decked with boughs and branches from the



<P>green trees that stood round about the town.&nbsp; Every door also



<P>was filled with persons, who had adorned every one their



<P>fore-part against their house with something of variety and



<P>singular excellency, to entertain him withal as he passed in



<P>the streets: they also themselves, as Emmanuel passed by, did



<P>welcome him with shouts and acclamations of joy, saying,



<P>'Blessed be the Prince that cometh in the name of his Father



<P>Shaddai.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fifthly.&nbsp; At the castle gates the elders of Mansoul, namely,



<P>the Lord Mayor, the Lord Willbewill, the subordinate



<P>preacher, Mr. Knowledge, and Mr. Mind, with other of the



<P>gentry of the place, saluted Emmanuel again.&nbsp; They bowed



<P>before him, they kissed the dust of his feet, they thanked,



<P>they blessed, and praised his Highness for not taking



<P>advantage against them for their sins, but rather had pity



<P>upon them in their misery, and returned to them with mercies,



<P>and to build up their Mansoul for ever.&nbsp; Thus was he had up



<P>straightway to the castle; for that was the royal palace, and



<P>the place where his honour was to dwell; the which was ready



<P>prepared for his Highness by the presence of the Lord



<P>Secretary, and the work of Captain Credence.&nbsp; So he entered



<P>in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sixthly.&nbsp; Then the people and commonalty of the town of



<P>Mansoul came to him into the castle to mourn, and to weep,



<P>and to lament for their wickedness, by which they had forced



<P>him out of the town.&nbsp; So when they were come, bowed



<P>themselves to the ground seven times; they also wept, they



<P>wept aloud, and asked forgiveness of the Prince, and prayed



<P>that he would again, as of old, confirm his love to Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To the which the great Prince replied, 'Weep not, but go your



<P>way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to



<P>them for whom nought is prepared; for the joy of your Lord is



<P>your strength.&nbsp; I am returned to Mansoul with mercies, and my



<P>name shall be set up, exalted, and magnified by it.'&nbsp; He also



<P>took these inhabitants, and kissed them, and laid them in his



<P>bosom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Moreover, he gave to the elders of Mansoul, and to each town



<P>officer, a chain of gold and a signet.&nbsp; He also sent to their



<P>wives earrings and jewels, and bracelets, and other things.



<P>He also bestowed upon the true-born children of Mansoul many



<P>precious things.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Emmanuel, the Prince, had done all these things for the



<P>famous town of Mansoul, then he said unto them, first, 'Wash



<P>your garments, then put on your ornaments, and then come to



<P>me into the castle of Mansoul.'&nbsp; So they went to the fountain



<P>that was set open for Judah and Jerusalem to wash in; and



<P>there they washed, and there they made their 'garments



<P>white,' and came again to the Prince into the castle, and



<P>thus they stood before him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And now there was music and dancing throughout the whole town



<P>of Mansoul, and that because their Prince had again granted



<P>to them his presence and the light of his countenance; the



<P>bells also did ring, and the sun shone comfortably upon them



<P>for a great while together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The town of Mansoul did also now more thoroughly seek the



<P>destruction and ruin of all remaining Diabolonians that abode



<P>in the walls, and the dens that they had in the town of



<P>Mansoul; for there was of them that had, to this day, escaped



<P>with life and limb from the hand of their suppressors in the



<P>famous town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But my Lord Willbewill was a greater terror to them now than



<P>ever he had been before; forasmuch as his heart was yet more



<P>fully bent to seek, contrive, and pursue them to the death;



<P>he pursued them night and day, and did put them now to sore



<P>distress, as will afterwards appear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After things were thus far put into order in the famous town



<P>of Mansoul, care was taken, and order given by the blessed



<P>Prince Emmanuel, that the townsmen should, without further



<P>delay, appoint some to go forth into the plain to bury the



<P>dead that were there, - the dead that fell by the sword of



<P>Emmanuel, and by the shield of the Captain Credence, - lest



<P>the fumes and ill savours that would arise from them might



<P>infect the air, and so annoy the famous town of Mansoul.



<P>This also was a reason of this order, namely, that, as much



<P>as in Mansoul lay, they might cut off the name, and being,



<P>and remembrance of those enemies from the thought of the



<P>famous town of Mansoul and its inhabitants.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So order was given out by the Lord Mayor, that wise and



<P>trusty friend of the town of Mansoul, that persons should be



<P>employed about this necessary business; and Mr. Godly-Fear,



<P>and one Mr. Upright, were to be overseers about this matter:



<P>so persons were put under them to work in the fields, and to



<P>bury the slain that lay dead in the plains.&nbsp; And these were



<P>their places of employment: some were to make the graves,



<P>some to bury the dead, and some were to go to and fro in the



<P>plains, and also round about the borders of Mansoul, to see



<P>if a skull, or a bone, or a piece of a bone of a doubter, was



<P>yet to be found above ground anywhere near the corporation;



<P>and if any were found, it was ordered, that the searchers



<P>that searched should set up a mark thereby, and a sign, that



<P>those that were appointed to bury them might find it, and



<P>bury it out of sight, that the name and remembrance of a



<P>Diabolonian doubter might be blotted out from under heaven;



<P>and that the children, and they that were to be born in



<P>Mansoul, might not know, if possible, what a skull, what a



<P>bone, or a piece of a bone of a doubter was.&nbsp; So the buriers,



<P>and those that were appointed for that purpose, did as they



<P>were commanded: they buried the doubters, and all the skulls



<P>and bones, and pieces of bones of doubters, wherever they



<P>found them; and so they cleansed the plains.&nbsp; Now also Mr.



<P>God's-Peace took up his commission, and acted again as in



<P>former days.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thus they buried in the plains about Mansoul the election



<P>doubters, the vocation doubters, the grace doubters, the



<P>perseverance doubters, the resurrection doubters, the



<P>salvation doubters, and the glory doubters; whose captains



<P>were Captain Rage, Captain Cruel, Captain Damnation, Captain



<P>Insatiable, Captain Brimstone, Captain Torment, Captain No-



<P>Ease, Captain Sepulchre, and Captain Past-Hope; and old



<P>Incredulity was, under Diabolus, their general.&nbsp; There were



<P>also the seven heads of their army; and they were the Lord



<P>Beelzebub, the Lord Lucifer, the Lord Legion, the Lord



<P>Apollyon, the Lord Python, the Lord Cerberus, and the Lord



<P>Belial.&nbsp; But the princes and the captains, with old



<P>Incredulity, their general, did all of them make their



<P>escape: so their men fell down slain by the power of the



<P>Prince's forces, and by the hands of the men of the town of



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; They also were buried as is afore related, to the



<P>exceeding great joy of the now famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; They



<P>that buried them buried also with them their arms, which were



<P>cruel instruments of death: (their weapons were arrows,



<P>darts, mauls, firebrands, and the like).&nbsp; They buried also



<P>their armour, their colours, banners, with the standard of



<P>Diabolus, and what else soever they could find that did but



<P>smell of a Diabolonian doubter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now when the tyrant had arrived at Hell-Gate Hill, with his



<P>old friend Incredulity, they immediately descended the den,



<P>and having there with their fellows for a while condoled



<P>their misfortune and great loss that they sustained against



<P>the town of Mansoul, they fell at length into a passion, and



<P>revenged they would be for the loss that they sustained



<P>before the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Wherefore they presently call a



<P>council to contrive yet further what was to be done against



<P>the famous town of Mansoul; for their yawning paunches could



<P>not wait to see the result of their Lord Lucifer's and their



<P>Lord Apollyon's counsel that they had given before; for their



<P>raging gorge thought every day, even as long as a short for



<P>ever, until they were filled with the body and soul, with the



<P>flesh and bones, and with all the delicates of Mansoul.&nbsp; They



<P>therefore resolve to make another attempt upon the town of



<P>Mansoul, and that by an army mixed and made up partly of



<P>doubters, and partly of blood-men.&nbsp; A more particular account



<P>now take of both.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The doubters are such as have their name from their nature,



<P>as well as from the land and kingdom where they are born:



<P>their nature is to put a question upon every one of the



<P>truths of Emmanuel; and their country is called the land of



<P>Doubting, and that land lieth off, and farthest remote to the



<P>north, between the land of Darkness and that called the



<P>'valley of the shadow of death.'&nbsp; For though the land of



<P>Darkness, and that called 'the valley of the shadow of



<P>death,' be sometimes called as if they were one and the self-



<P>same place, yet indeed they are two, lying but a little way



<P>asunder, and the land of Doubting points in, and lieth



<P>between them.&nbsp; This is the land of Doubting; and these that



<P>came with Diabolus to ruin the town of Mansoul are the



<P>natives of that country.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The blood-men are a people that have their name derived from



<P>the malignity of their nature, and from the fury that is in



<P>them to execute it upon the town of Mansoul: their land lieth



<P>under the dog-star, and by that they are governed as to their



<P>intellectuals.&nbsp; The name of their country is the province of



<P>Loath-good: the remote parts of it are far distant from the



<P>land of Doubting, yet they do both butt and bound upon the



<P>hill called Hell-Gate Hill.&nbsp; These people are always in



<P>league with the doubters, for they jointly do make question



<P>of the faith and fidelity of the men of the town of Mansoul,



<P>and so are both alike qualified for the service of their



<P>prince.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now of these two countries did Diabolus, by the beating of



<P>his drum, raise another army against the town of Mansoul, of



<P>five-and-twenty thousand strong.&nbsp; There were ten thousand



<P>doubters, and fifteen thousand blood-men, and they were put



<P>under several captains for the war; and old Incredulity was



<P>again made general of the army.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As for the doubters, their captains were five of the seven



<P>that were heads of the last Diabolonian army, and these are



<P>their names: Captain Beelzebub, Captain Lucifer, Captain



<P>Apollyon, Captain Legion, and Captain Cerberus; and the



<P>captains that they had before were some of them made



<P>lieutenants, and some ensigns of the army.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Diabolus did not count that, in this expedition of his,



<P>these doubters would prove his principal men, for their



<P>manhood had been tried before; also the Mansoulians had put



<P>them to the worst: only he did bring them to multiply a



<P>number, and to help, if need was, at a pinch.&nbsp; But his trust



<P>he put in his blood-men, for that they were all rugged



<P>villains, and he knew that they had done feats heretofore.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As for the blood-men, they also were under command and the



<P>names of their captains were, Captain Cain, Captain Nimrod,



<P>Captain Ishmael, Captain Esau, Captain Saul, Captain Absalom,



<P>Captain Judas, and Captain Pope.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1. Captain Cain was over two bands, namely, the zealous and



<P>the angry blood-men: his standard-bearer bare the red



<P>colours, and his scutcheon was the murdering club.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2. Captain Nimrod was captain over two bands, namely, the



<P>tyrannical and encroaching blood-men: his standard-bearer



<P>bare the red colours, and his scutcheon was the great



<P>bloodhound.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3. Captain Ishmael was captain over two bands, namely, the



<P>mocking and scorning blood-men: his standard-bearer bare the



<P>red colours, and his scutcheon was one mocking at Abraham's



<P>Isaac.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>4. Captain Esau was captain over two bands, namely, the



<P>blood-men that grudged that another should have the blessing;



<P>also over the blood-men that are for executing their private



<P>revenge upon others: his standard-bearer bare the red



<P>colours, and his scutcheon was one privately lurking to



<P>murder Jacob.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>5. Captain Saul was captain over two bands, namely, the



<P>groundlessly jealous and the devilishly furious blood-men:



<P>his standard-bearer bare the red colours, and his scutcheon



<P>was three bloody darts cast at harmless David.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>6. Captain Absalom was captain over two bands, namely, over



<P>the blood-men that will kill a father or a friend for the



<P>glory of this world; also over those blood-men that will hold



<P>one fair in hand with words, till they shall have pierced him



<P>with their swords: his standard-bearer did bear the red



<P>colours, and his scutcheon was the son pursuing the father's



<P>blood.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>7. Captain Judas was over two bands, namely, the blood-men



<P>that will sell a man's life for money, and those also that



<P>will betray their friend with a kiss: his standard-bearer



<P>bare the red colours, and his scutcheon was thirty pieces of



<P>silver and the halter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>8. Captain Pope was captain over one band, for all these



<P>spirits are joined in one under him: his standard-bearer bare



<P>the red colours, and his scutcheon was the stake, the flame,



<P>and the good man in it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, the reason why Diabolus did so soon rally another force,



<P>after he had been beaten out of the field, was, for that he



<P>put mighty confidence in this army of blood-men; for he put a



<P>great deal of more trust in them than he did before in his



<P>army of doubters; though they had also often done great



<P>service for him in the strengthening of him in his kingdom.



<P>But these blood-men, he had proved them often, and their



<P>sword did seldom return empty.&nbsp; Besides, he knew that these,



<P>like mastiffs, would fasten upon any; upon father, mother,



<P>brother, sister, prince, or governor, yea upon the Prince of



<P>princes.&nbsp; And that which encouraged him the more was, for



<P>that they once did force Emmanuel out of the kingdom of



<P>Universe; 'And why,' thought he, 'may they not also drive him



<P>from the town of Mansoul?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So this army of five-and-twenty thousand strong was, by their



<P>general, the great Lord Incredulity, led up against the town



<P>of Mansoul.&nbsp; Now Mr. Prywell, the scoutmaster-general, did



<P>himself go out to spy, and he did bring Mansoul tidings of



<P>their coming.&nbsp; Wherefore they shut up their gates, and put



<P>themselves in a posture of defence against these new



<P>Diabolonians that came up against the town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So Diabolus brought up his army, and beleaguered the town of



<P>Mansoul; the doubters were placed about Feel-gate, and the



<P>blood-men set down before Eye-gate and Ear-gate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now when this army had thus encamped themselves, Incredulity



<P>did, in the name of Diabolus, his own name, and in the name



<P>of the blood-men and the rest that were with him, send a



<P>summons as hot as a red-hot iron to Mansoul, to yield to



<P>their demands; threatening, that if they still stood it out



<P>against them, they would presently burn down Mansoul with



<P>fire.&nbsp; For you must know that, as for the blood-men, they



<P>were not so much that Mansoul should be surrendered, as that



<P>Mansoul should be destroyed, and cut off out of the land of



<P>the living.&nbsp; True, they send to them to surrender; but should



<P>they so do, that would not stench or quench the thirsts of



<P>these men.&nbsp; They must have blood, the blood of Mansoul, else



<P>they die; and it is from hence that they have their name.



<P>Wherefore these blood-men he reserved while now that they



<P>might, when all his engines proved ineffectual, as his last



<P>and sure card be played against the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when the townsmen had received this red-hot summons, it



<P>begat in them at present some changing and interchanging



<P>thoughts; but they jointly agreed, in less than half an hour,



<P>to carry the summons to the Prince, the which they did when



<P>they had writ at the bottom of it, 'Lord, save Mansoul from



<P>bloody men!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So he took it, and looked upon it, and considered it, and



<P>took notice also of that short petition that the men of



<P>Mansoul had written at the bottom of it, and called to him



<P>the noble Captain Credence, and bid him go and take Captain



<P>Patience with him, and go and take care of that side of



<P>Mansoul that was beleaguered by the blood-men.&nbsp; So they went



<P>and did as they were commanded: the Captain Credence went and



<P>took Captain Patience, and they both secured that side of



<P>Mansoul that was besieged by the blood-men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then he commanded that Captain Good-hope and Captain Charity,



<P>and my Lord Willbewill, should take charge of the other side



<P>of the town.&nbsp; 'And I,' said the Prince, 'will set my standard



<P>upon the battlements of your castle, and do you three watch



<P>against the doubters.'&nbsp; This done, he again commanded that



<P>the brave captain, the Captain Experience, should draw up his



<P>men in the market-place, and that there he should exercise



<P>them day by day before the people of the town of Mansoul.



<P>Now this siege was long, and many a fierce attempt did the



<P>enemy, especially those called the blood-men, make upon the



<P>town of Mansoul; and many a shrewd brush did some of the



<P>townsmen meet with from them, especially Captain Self-Denial,



<P>who, I should have told you before, was commanded to take the



<P>care of Ear-gate and Eye-gate now against the blood-men.



<P>This Captain Self-Denial was a young man, but stout, and a



<P>townsman in Mansoul, as Captain Experience also was.&nbsp; And



<P>Emmanuel, at his second return to Mansoul, made him a captain



<P>over a thousand of the Mansoulians, for the good of the



<P>corporation.&nbsp; This captain, therefore, being an hardy man,



<P>and a man of great courage, and willing to venture himself



<P>for the good of the town of Mansoul, would now and then sally



<P>out upon the blood-men, and give them many notable alarms,



<P>and entered several brisk skirmishes with them, and also did



<P>some execution upon them; but you must think that this could



<P>not easily be done, but he must meet with brushes himself,



<P>for he carried several of their marks in his face; yea, and



<P>some in some other parts of his body.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So, after some time spent for the trial of the faith, and



<P>hope, and love of the town of Mansoul, the Prince Emmanuel



<P>upon a day calls his captains and men of war together, and



<P>divides them into two companies; this done, he commands them



<P>at a time appointed, and that in the morning very early, to



<P>sally out upon the enemy, saying: 'Let half of you fall upon



<P>the doubters, and half of you fall upon the blood-men.&nbsp; Those



<P>of you that go out against the doubters, kill and slay, and



<P>cause to perish so many of them as by any means you can lay



<P>hands on; but for you that go out against the blood-men, slay



<P>them not, but take them alive.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So, at the time appointed, betimes in the morning, the



<P>captains went out as they were commanded, against the



<P>enemies.&nbsp; Captain Good-Hope, Captain Charity, and those that



<P>were joined with them, as Captain Innocent and Captain



<P>Experience, went out against the doubters; and Captain



<P>Credence, and Captain Patience, with Captain Self-Denial, and



<P>the rest that were to join with them, went out against the



<P>blood-men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, those that went out against the doubters drew up into a



<P>body before the plain, and marched on to bid them battle.



<P>But the doubters, remembering their last success, made a



<P>retreat, not daring to stand the shock, but fled from the



<P>Prince's men; wherefore they pursued them, and in their



<P>pursuit slew many, but they could not catch them all.&nbsp; Now



<P>those that escaped went some of them home; and the rest by



<P>fives, nines, and seventeens, like wanderers, went straggling



<P>up and down the country, where they upon the barbarous people



<P>showed and exercised many of their Diabolonian actions: nor



<P>did these people rise up in arms against them, but suffered



<P>themselves to be enslaved by them.&nbsp; They would also after



<P>this show themselves in companies before the town of Mansoul,



<P>but never to abide in it; for if Captain Credence, Captain



<P>Good-Hope, or Captain Experience did but show themselves,



<P>they fled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Those that went out against the blood-men did as they were



<P>commanded: they forbore to slay any, but sought to compass



<P>them about.&nbsp; But the blood-men, when they saw that no



<P>Emmanuel was in the field, concluded also that no Emmanuel



<P>was in Mansoul; wherefore they, looking upon what the



<P>captains did to be, as they called it, a fruit of the



<P>extravagancy of their wild and foolish fancies, rather



<P>despised them than feared them.&nbsp; But the captains, minding



<P>their business, at last did compass them round; they also



<P>that had routed the doubters came in amain to their aid: so,



<P>in fine, after some little struggling, (for the blood-men



<P>also would have run for it, only now it was too late; for



<P>though they are mischievous and cruel, where they can



<P>overcome, yet all blood-men are chicken-hearted men, when



<P>they once come to see themselves matched and equalled,) - so



<P>the captains took them, and brought them to the Prince.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now when they were taken, had before the Prince, and



<P>examined, he found them to be of three several counties,



<P>though they all came out of one land.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1. One sort of them came out of Blind-man-shire, and they



<P>were such as did ignorantly what they did.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2. Another sort of them came out of Blind-zeal-shire, and



<P>they did superstitiously what they did.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3. The third sort of them came out of the town of Malice, in



<P>the county of Envy, and they did what they did out of spite



<P>and implacableness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the first of these, namely, they that came out of Blind-



<P>man-shire, when they saw where they were, and against whom



<P>they had fought, they trembled and cried, as they stood



<P>before him; and as many of these as asked him mercy, he



<P>touched their lips with his golden sceptre.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They that came out of Blind-zeal-shire, they did not as their



<P>fellows did; for they pleaded that they had a right to do



<P>what they did, because Mansoul was a town whose laws and



<P>customs were diverse from all that dwelt thereabouts.&nbsp; Very



<P>few of these could be brought to see their evil; but those



<P>that did, and asked mercy, they also obtained favour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, they that came out of the town of Malice, that is in the



<P>county of Envy, they neither wept, nor disputed, nor



<P>repented, but stood gnawing their tongues before him for



<P>anguish and madness, because they could not have their will



<P>upon Mansoul.&nbsp; Now these last, with all those of the other



<P>two sorts that did not unfeignedly ask pardon for their



<P>faults, - those he made to enter into sufficient bond to



<P>answer for what they had done against Mansoul, and against



<P>her King, at the great and general assizes to be holden for



<P>our Lord the King, where he himself should appoint for the



<P>country and kingdom of Universe.&nbsp; So they became bound each



<P>man for himself, to come in, when called upon, to answer



<P>before our Lord the King for what they had done as before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And thus much concerning this second army that was sent by



<P>Diabolus to overthrow Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But there were three of those that came from the land of



<P>Doubting, who, after they had wandered and ranged the country



<P>a while, and perceived that they had escaped, were so hardy



<P>as to thrust themselves, knowing that yet there were in the



<P>town Diabolonians, - I say, they were so hardy as to thrust



<P>themselves into Mansoul among them.&nbsp; (Three, did I say?&nbsp; I



<P>think there were four.)&nbsp; Now, to whose house should these



<P>Diabolonian doubters go, but to the house of an old



<P>Diabolonian in Mansoul, whose name was Evil-Questioning, a



<P>very great enemy he was to Mansoul, and a great doer among



<P>the Diabolonians there.&nbsp; Well, to this Evil-Questioning's



<P>house, as was said, did these Diabolonians come (you may be



<P>sure that they had directions how to find the way thither),



<P>so he made them welcome, pitied their misfortune, and



<P>succoured them with the best that he had in his house.&nbsp; Now,



<P>after a little acquaintance (and it was not long before they



<P>had that), this old Evil-Questioning asked the doubters if



<P>they were all of a town (he knew that they were all of one



<P>kingdom), and they answered: 'No, nor not of one shire



<P>neither; for I,' said one, 'am an election doubter:'&nbsp; 'I,'



<P>said another, 'am a vocation doubter:' then said the third,



<P>'I am a salvation doubter:' and the fourth said he was a



<P>grace doubter.&nbsp; 'Well,' quoth the old gentleman, 'be of what



<P>shire you will, I am persuaded that you are down, boys: you



<P>have the very length of my foot, are one with my heart, and



<P>shall be welcome to me.'&nbsp; So they thanked him, and were glad



<P>that they had found themselves an harbour in Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Evil-Questioning to them: 'How many of your company



<P>might there be that came with you to the siege of Mansoul?'



<P>and they answered: 'There were but ten thousand doubters in



<P>all, for the rest of the army consisted of fifteen thousand



<P>blood-men.&nbsp; These blood-men,' quoth they, 'border upon our



<P>country; but, poor men! as we hear, they were every one taken



<P>by Emmanuel's forces.'&nbsp; 'Ten thousand!' quoth the old



<P>gentleman; 'I will promise you, that is a round company.&nbsp; But



<P>how came it to pass, since you were so mighty a number, that



<P>you fainted, and durst not fight your foes?'&nbsp; 'Our general,'



<P>said they, 'was the first man that did run for it.'&nbsp; 'Pray,'



<P>quoth their landlord, 'who was that, your cowardly general?'



<P>'He was once the Lord Mayor of Mansoul,' said they: 'but pray



<P>call him not a cowardly general; for whether any from the



<P>east to the west has done more service for our prince



<P>Diabolus, than has my Lord Incredulity, will be a hard



<P>question for you to answer.&nbsp; But had they catched him, they



<P>would for certain have hanged him; and we promise you,



<P>hanging is but a bad business.'&nbsp; Then said the old gentleman,



<P>'I would that all the ten thousand doubters were now well



<P>armed in Mansoul, and myself at the head of them; I would see



<P>what I could do.'&nbsp; 'Ay,' said they, 'that would be well if we



<P>could see that; but wishes, alas! what are they?' and these



<P>words were spoken aloud.&nbsp; 'Well,' said old Evil-Questioning,



<P>'take heed that you talk not too loud; you must be quat and



<P>close, and must take care of yourselves while you are here,



<P>or, I will assure you, you will be snapped.'&nbsp; 'Why?' quoth



<P>the doubters.&nbsp; 'Why!' quoth the old gentleman; 'why! because



<P>both the Prince and Lord Secretary, and their captains and



<P>soldiers, are all at present in town; yea, the town is as



<P>full of them as ever it can hold.&nbsp; And besides, there is one



<P>whose name is Willbewill, a most cruel enemy of ours, and him



<P>the Prince has made keeper of the gates, and has commanded



<P>him that, with all the diligence he can, he should look for,



<P>search out, and destroy all, and all manner of Diabolonians.



<P>And if he lighteth upon you, down you go, though your heads



<P>were made of gold.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And now, to see how it happened, one of the Lord Willbewill's



<P>faithful soldiers, whose name was Mr. Diligence, stood all



<P>this while listening under old Evil-Questioning's eaves, and



<P>heard all the talk that had been betwixt him and the doubters



<P>that he entertained under his roof.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The soldier was a man that my lord had much confidence in,



<P>and that he loved dearly; and that both because he was a man



<P>of courage, and also a man that was unwearied in seeking



<P>after Diabolonians to apprehend them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now this man, as I told you, heard all the talk that was



<P>between old Evil-Questioning and these Diabolonians;



<P>wherefore what does he but goes to his lord, and tells him



<P>what he had heard.&nbsp; 'And sayest thou so, my trusty?' quoth my



<P>lord.&nbsp; 'Ay,' quoth Diligence, 'that I do; and if your



<P>lordship will be pleased to go with me, you shall find it as



<P>I have said.'&nbsp; 'And are they there?' quoth my lord.&nbsp; 'I know



<P>Evil-Questioning well, for he and I were great in the time of



<P>our apostasy: but I know not now where he dwells.'&nbsp; 'But I



<P>do,' said his man, 'and if your lordship will go, I will lead



<P>you the way to his den.'&nbsp; 'Go!' quoth my lord, 'that I will.



<P>Come, my Diligence, let us go find them out.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So my lord and his man went together the direct way to his



<P>house.&nbsp; Now his man went before to show him his way, and they



<P>went till they came even under old Mr. Evil-Questioning's



<P>wall.&nbsp; Then said Diligence, 'Hark! my lord, do you know the



<P>old gentleman's tongue when you hear it?'&nbsp; 'Yes,' said my



<P>lord, 'I know it well, but I have not seen him many a day.



<P>This I know, he is cunning; I wish he doth not give us the



<P>slip.'&nbsp; 'Let me alone for that,' said his servant Diligence.



<P>'But how shall we find the door?' quoth my lord.&nbsp; 'Let me



<P>alone for that, too,' said his man.&nbsp; So he had my Lord



<P>Willbewill about, and showed him the way to the door.&nbsp; Then



<P>my lord, without more ado, broke open the door, rushed into



<P>the house, and caught them all five together, even as



<P>Diligence his man had told him.&nbsp; So my lord apprehended them,



<P>and led them away, and committed them to the hand of Mr.



<P>Trueman, the gaoler, and commanded, and he did put them in



<P>ward.&nbsp; This done, my Lord Mayor was acquainted in the morning



<P>with what my Lord Willbewill had done over night, and his



<P>lordship rejoiced much at the news, not only because there



<P>were doubters apprehended, but because that old Evil-



<P>Questioning was taken; for he had been a very great trouble



<P>to Mansoul, and much affliction to my Lord Mayor himself.&nbsp; He



<P>had also been sought for often, but no hand could ever be



<P>laid upon him till now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, the next thing was to make preparation to try these



<P>five that by my lord had been apprehended, and that were in



<P>the hands of Mr. Trueman, the gaoler.&nbsp; So the day was set,



<P>and the court called and come together, and the prisoners



<P>brought to the bar.&nbsp; My Lord Willbewill had power to have



<P>slain them when at first he took them, and that without any



<P>more ado; but he thought it at this time more for the honour



<P>of the Prince, the comfort of Mansoul, and the discouragement



<P>of the enemy, to bring them forth to public judgment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But, I say, Mr. Trueman brought them in chains to the bar; to



<P>the town-hall, for that was the place of judgment.&nbsp; So, to be



<P>short, the jury was panelled, the witnesses sworn, and the



<P>prisoners tried for their lives: the jury was the same that



<P>tried Mr. No-Truth, Pitiless, Haughty, and the rest of their



<P>companions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And, first, old Questioning himself was set to the bar for he



<P>was the receiver, the entertainer, and comforter of these



<P>doubters, that by nation were outlandish men: then he was bid



<P>to hearken to his charge, and was told that he had liberty to



<P>object, if he had ought to say for himself.&nbsp; So his



<P>indictment was read: the manner and form here follows.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Mr. Questioning, Thou art here indicted by the name of Evil-



<P>Questioning, an intruder upon the town of Mansoul, for that



<P>thou art a Diabolonian by nature, and also a hater of the



<P>Prince Emmanuel, and one that hast studied the ruin of the



<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Thou art also here indicted for



<P>countenancing the King's enemies, after wholesome laws made



<P>to the contrary: for, 1. Thou hast questioned the truth of



<P>her doctrine and state: 2. In wishing that ten thousand



<P>doubters were in her: 3. In receiving, in entertaining, and



<P>encouraging of her enemies, that came from their army unto



<P>thee.&nbsp; What sayest thou to this indictment? art thou guilty



<P>or not guilty?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'My lord,' quoth he, 'I know not the meaning of this



<P>indictment, forasmuch as I am not the man concerned in it;



<P>the man that standeth by this charge accused before this



<P>bench is called by the name of Evil-Questioning, which name I



<P>deny to be mine, mine being Honest-Inquiry.&nbsp; The one indeed



<P>sounds like the other; but, I trow, your lordships know that



<P>between these two there is a wide difference; for I hope that



<P>a man, even in the worst of times, and that, too, amongst the



<P>worst of men, may make an honest inquiry after things,



<P>without running the danger of death.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then spake my Lord Willbewill, for he was one of the



<P>witnesses: 'My lord, and you the honourable bench and



<P>magistrates of the town of Mansoul, you all have heard with



<P>your ears that the prisoner at the bar has denied his name,



<P>and so thinks to shift from the charge of the indictment.



<P>But I know him to be the man concerned, and that his proper



<P>name is Evil-Questioning.&nbsp; I have known him, my lord, above



<P>these thirty years, for he and I (a shame it is for me to



<P>speak it) were great acquaintance, when Diabolus, that



<P>tyrant, had the government of Mansoul; and I testify that he



<P>is a Diabolonian by nature, an enemy to our Prince, and a



<P>hater of the blessed town of Mansoul.&nbsp; He has, in times of



<P>rebellion, been at and lain in my house, my lord, not so



<P>little as twenty nights together, and we did use to talk



<P>then, for the substance of talk, as he and his doubters have



<P>talked of late: true, I have not seen him many a day.&nbsp; I



<P>suppose that the coming of Emmanuel to Mansoul has made him



<P>change his lodgings, as this indictment has driven him to



<P>change his name; but this is the man, my lord.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the court unto him, 'Hast thou any more to say?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes,' quoth the old gentleman, 'that I have; for all that as



<P>yet has been said against me, is but by the mouth of one



<P>witness; and it is not lawful for the famous town of Mansoul,



<P>at the mouth of one witness, to put any man to death.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then stood forth Mr. Diligence, and said, 'My lord, as I was



<P>upon my watch such a night at the head of Bad Street, in this



<P>town, I chanced to hear a muttering within this gentleman's



<P>house.&nbsp; Then, thought I, what is to do here?&nbsp; So I went up



<P>close, but very softly, to the side of the house to listen,



<P>thinking, as indeed it fell out, that there I might light



<P>upon some Diabolonian conventicle.&nbsp; So, as I said, I drew



<P>nearer and nearer; and when I was got up close to the wall,



<P>it was but a while before I perceived that there were



<P>outlandish men in the house; but I did well understand their



<P>speech, for I have been a traveller myself.&nbsp; Now, hearing



<P>such language in such a tottering cottage as this old



<P>gentleman dwelt in, I clapped mine ear to a hole in the



<P>window, and there heard them talk as followeth.&nbsp; This old Mr.



<P>Questioning asked these doubters what they were, whence they



<P>came, and what was their business in these parts; and they



<P>told him to all these questions, yet he did entertain them.



<P>He also asked what numbers there were of them; and they told



<P>him ten thousand men.&nbsp; He then asked them, why they made no



<P>more manly assault upon Mansoul; and they told him: so he



<P>called their general coward, for marching off when he should



<P>have fought for his prince.&nbsp; Further, this old Evil-



<P>Questioning wished, and I heard him wish, would all the ten



<P>thousand doubters were now in Mansoul, and himself at the



<P>head of them.&nbsp; He bid them also to take heed and lie quat;



<P>for if they were taken they must die, although they had heads



<P>of gold.'&nbsp; Then said the court: 'Mr. Evil-Questioning, here



<P>is now another witness against you, and his testimony is



<P>full: 1. He swears that you did receive these men into your



<P>house, and that you did nourish them there, though you knew



<P>that they were Diabolonians, and the King's enemies.&nbsp; 2. He



<P>swears that you did wish ten thousand of them in Mansoul.&nbsp; 3.



<P>He swears that you did give them advice to be quat and close,



<P>lest they were taken by the King's servants.&nbsp; All which



<P>manifesteth that thou art a Diabolonian; but hadst thou been



<P>a friend to the King, thou wouldst have apprehended them.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Evil-Questioning: 'To the first of these I answer,



<P>The men that came into mine house were strangers, and I took



<P>them in; and is it now become a crime in Mansoul for a man to



<P>entertain strangers?&nbsp; That I did also nourish them is true;



<P>and why should my charity be blamed?&nbsp; As for the reason why I



<P>wished ten thousand of them in Mansoul, I never told it to



<P>the witnesses, nor to themselves.&nbsp; I might wish them to be



<P>taken, and so my wish might mean well to Mansoul, for aught



<P>that any yet knows.&nbsp; I did also bid them take heed that they



<P>fell not into the captains' hands; but that might be because



<P>I am unwilling that any man should be slain, and not because



<P>I would have the King's enemies as such escape.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My Lord Mayor then replied: 'That though it was a virtue to



<P>entertain strangers, yet it was treason to entertain the



<P>King's enemies.&nbsp; And for what else thou hast said, thou dost



<P>by words but labour to evade and defer the execution of



<P>judgment.&nbsp; But could there be no more proved against thee but



<P>that thou art a Diabolonian, thou must for that die the death



<P>by the law; but to be a receiver, a nourisher, a



<P>countenancer, and a harbourer of others of them, yea, of



<P>outlandish Diabolonians, yea, of them that came from far on



<P>purpose to cut off and destroy our Mansoul - this must not be



<P>borne.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Evil-Questioning: 'I see how the game will go: I



<P>must die for my name, and for my charity.'&nbsp; And so he held



<P>his peace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then they called the outlandish doubters to the bar, and the



<P>first of them that was arraigned was the election doubter.



<P>So his indictment was read; and because he was an outlandish



<P>man, the substance of it was told him by an interpreter;



<P>namely, 'That he was there charged with being an enemy of



<P>Emmanuel the Prince, a hater of the town of Mansoul, and an



<P>opposer of her most wholesome doctrine.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then the judge asked him if he would plead? but he said only



<P>this - That he confessed that he was an election doubter, and



<P>that that was the religion that he had ever been brought up



<P>in.&nbsp; And said, moreover, 'If I must die for my religion, I



<P>trow, I shall die a martyr, and so I care the less.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>JUDGE.&nbsp; Then it was replied: 'To question election, is to



<P>overthrow a great doctrine of the gospel, namely, the



<P>omnisciency, and power, and will of God; to take away the



<P>liberty of God with his creature, to stumble the faith of the



<P>town of Mansoul, and to make salvation to depend upon works,



<P>and not upon grace.&nbsp; It also belied the word, and disquieted



<P>the minds of the men of Mansoul; therefore by the best of



<P>laws he must die.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then was the vocation doubter called, and set to the bar; and



<P>his indictment for substance was the same with the other,



<P>only he was particularly charged with denying the calling of



<P>Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The judge asked him also what he had to say for himself?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So he replied: 'That he never believed that there was any



<P>such thing as a distinct and powerful call of God to Mansoul;



<P>otherwise than by the general voice of the word, nor by that



<P>neither, otherwise than as it exhorted them to forbear evil,



<P>and to do that which is good, and in so doing a promise of



<P>happiness is annexed.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the judge: 'Thou art a Diabolonian, and hast denied



<P>a great part of one of the most experimental truths of the



<P>Prince of the town of Mansoul; for he has called, and she has



<P>heard a most distinct and powerful call of her Emmanuel, by



<P>which she has been quickened, awakened, and possessed with



<P>heavenly grace to desire to have communion with her Prince,



<P>to serve him, and to do his will, and to look for her



<P>happiness merely of his good pleasure.&nbsp; And for thine



<P>abhorrence of this good doctrine, thou must die the death.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then the grace doubter was called, and his indictment was



<P>read and he replied thereto: 'That though he was of the land



<P>of doubting, his father was the offspring of a Pharisee, and



<P>lived in good fashion among his neighbours, and that he



<P>taught him to believe, and believe it I do, and will, that



<P>Mansoul shall never be saved freely by grace.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the judge: 'Why, the law of the Prince is plain: 1.



<P>Negatively, "not of works:" 2. Positively, "by grace you are



<P>saved."&nbsp; And thy religion settleth in and upon the works of



<P>the flesh; for the works of the law are the works of the



<P>flesh.&nbsp; Besides, in saying as thou hast done, thou hast



<P>robbed God of His glory, and given it to a sinful man; thou



<P>hast robbed Christ of the necessity of His undertaking, and



<P>the sufficiency thereof, and hast given both these to the



<P>works of the flesh.&nbsp; Thou hast despised the work of the Holy



<P>Ghost, and hast magnified the will of the flesh, and of the



<P>legal mind.&nbsp; Thou art a Diabolonian, the son of a



<P>Diabolonian; and for thy Diabolonian principles thou must



<P>die.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The court then, having proceeded thus far with them, sent out



<P>the jury, who forthwith brought them in guilty of death.



<P>Then stood up the Recorder, and addressed himself to the



<P>prisoners: 'You, the prisoners at the bar, you have been here



<P>indicted, and proved guilty of high crimes against Emmanuel



<P>our Prince, and against the welfare of the famous town of



<P>Mansoul, crimes for which you must be put to death, and die



<P>ye accordingly.'&nbsp; So they were sentenced to the death of the



<P>cross.&nbsp; The place assigned them for execution, was that where



<P>Diabolus drew up his last army against Mansoul; save only



<P>that old Evil-Questioning was hanged at the top of Bad



<P>Street, just over against his own door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the town of Mansoul had thus far rid themselves of their



<P>enemies, and of the troublers of their peace, in the next



<P>place a strict commandment was given out, that yet my Lord



<P>Willbewill should, with Diligence his man, search for, and do



<P>his best to apprehend what town Diabolonians were yet left



<P>alive in Mansoul.&nbsp; The names of several of them were, Mr.



<P>Fooling, Mr. Let-Good-Slip, Mr. Slavish-Fear, Mr. No-Love,



<P>Mr. Mistrust, Mr. Flesh, and Mr. Sloth.&nbsp; It was also



<P>commanded, that he should apprehend Mr. Evil-Questioning's



<P>children, that he left behind him, and that they should



<P>demolish his house.&nbsp; The children that he left behind him



<P>were these: Mr. Doubt, and he was his eldest son; the next to



<P>him was Legal-Life, Unbelief, Wrong-Thoughts-of-Christ, Clip-



<P>Promise, Carnal-Sense, Live-by-Feeling, Self-Love.&nbsp; All these



<P>he had by one wife, and her name was No-Hope; she was the



<P>kinswoman of old Incredulity, for he was her uncle; and when



<P>her father, old Dark, was dead, he took her and brought her



<P>up, and when she was marriageable, he gave her to this old



<P>Evil-Questioning to wife.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now the Lord Willbewill did put into execution his



<P>commission, with great Diligence, his man.&nbsp; He took Fooling



<P>in the streets, and hanged him up in Want-wit-Alley, over



<P>against his own house.&nbsp; This Fooling was he that would have



<P>had the town of Mansoul deliver up Captain Credence into the



<P>hands of Diabolus, provided that then he would have withdrawn



<P>his force out of the town.&nbsp; He also took Mr. Let-Good-Slip



<P>one day as he was busy in the market, and executed him



<P>according to law.&nbsp; Now there was an honest poor man in



<P>Mansoul, and his name was Mr. Meditation, one of no great



<P>account in the days of apostasy, but now of repute with the



<P>best of the town.&nbsp; This man, therefore, they were willing to



<P>prefer.&nbsp; Now Mr. Let-Good-Slip had a great deal of wealth



<P>heretofore in Mansoul, and, at Emmanuel's coming, it was



<P>sequestered to the use of the Prince: this, therefore, was



<P>now given to Mr. Meditation, to improve for the common good,



<P>and after him to his son, Mr. Think-Well; this Think-Well he



<P>had by Mrs. Piety his wife, and she was the daughter of Mr.



<P>Recorder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After this, my lord apprehended Clip-Promise: now because he



<P>was a notorious villain, for by his doings much of the King's



<P>coin was abused, therefore he was made a public example.&nbsp; He



<P>was arraigned and judged to be first set in the pillory, then



<P>to be whipped by all the children and servants in Mansoul,



<P>and then to be hanged till he was dead.&nbsp; Some may wonder at



<P>the severity of this man's punishment; but those that are



<P>honest traders in Mansoul, are sensible of the great abuse



<P>that one clipper of promises in little time may do to the



<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; And truly my judgment is, that all those of



<P>his name and life should be served even as he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He also apprehended Carnal-Sense, and put him in hold; but



<P>how it came about, I cannot tell, but he brake prison, and



<P>made his escape: yea, and the bold villain will not yet quit



<P>the town, but lurks in the Diabolonian dens a days, and



<P>haunts like a ghost honest men's houses a nights.&nbsp; Wherefore,



<P>there was a proclamation set up in the market-place in



<P>Mansoul, signifying that whosoever could discover Carnal-



<P>Sense, and apprehend him and slay him, should be admitted



<P>daily to the Prince's table, and should be made keeper of the



<P>treasure of Mansoul.&nbsp; Many, therefore, did bend themselves to



<P>do this thing, but take him and slay him they could not,



<P>though often he was discovered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But my lord took Mr. Wrong-Thoughts-of-Christ, and put him in



<P>prison, and he died there; though it was long first, for he



<P>died of a lingering consumption.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Self-Love was also taken and committed to custody; but there



<P>were many that were allied to him in Mansoul, so his judgment



<P>was deferred.&nbsp; But at last Mr. Self-Denial stood up, and



<P>said: 'If such villains as these may be winked at in Mansoul,



<P>I will lay down my commission.'&nbsp; He also took him from the



<P>crowd, and had him among his soldiers, and there he was



<P>brained.&nbsp; But some in Mansoul muttered at it, though none



<P>durst speak plainly, because Emmanuel was in town.&nbsp; But this



<P>brave act of Captain Self-Denial came to the Prince's ears;



<P>so he sent for him, and made him a lord in Mansoul.&nbsp; My Lord



<P>Willbewill also obtained great commendations of Emmanuel, for



<P>what he had done for the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then my Lord Self-Denial took courage, and set to the



<P>pursuing of the Diabolonians, with my Lord Willbewill; and



<P>they took Live-by-Feeling, and they took Legal-Life, and put



<P>them in hold till they died.&nbsp; But Mr. Unbelief was a nimble



<P>Jack: him they could never lay hold of, though they attempted



<P>to do it often.&nbsp; He therefore, and some few more of the



<P>subtlest of the Diabolonian tribe, did yet remain in Mansoul,



<P>to the time that Mansoul left off to dwell any longer in the



<P>kingdom of Universe.&nbsp; But they kept them to their dens and



<P>holes: if one of them did appear, or happen to be seen in any



<P>of the streets of the town of Mansoul, the whole town would



<P>be up in arms after them; yea, the very children in Mansoul



<P>would cry out after them as after a thief, and would wish



<P>that they might stone them to death with stones.&nbsp; And now did



<P>Mansoul arrive to some good degree of peace and quiet; her



<P>Prince also did abide within her borders; her captains, also,



<P>and her soldiers did their duties; and Mansoul minded her



<P>trade that she had with the country that was afar off; also



<P>she was busy in her manufacture.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the town of Mansoul had thus far rid themselves of so



<P>many of their enemies, and the troublers of their peace, the



<P>Prince sent to them, and appointed a day wherein he would, at



<P>the market-place, meet the whole people, and there give them



<P>in charge concerning some further matters, that, if observed,



<P>would tend to their further safety and comfort, and to the



<P>condemnation and destruction of their home-bred Diabolonians.



<P>So the day appointed was come, and the townsmen met together;



<P>Emmanuel also came down in his chariot, and all his captains



<P>in their state attending him, on the right hand and on the



<P>left.&nbsp; Then was an oyes made for silence, and, after some



<P>mutual carriages of love, the Prince began, and thus



<P>proceeded:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You, my Mansoul, and the beloved of mine heart, many and



<P>great are the privileges that I have bestowed upon you; I



<P>have singled you out from others, and have chosen you to



<P>myself, not for your worthiness, but for mine own sake.&nbsp; I



<P>have also redeemed you, not only from the dread of my



<P>Father's law, but from the hand of Diabolus.&nbsp; This I have



<P>done because I loved you, and because I have set my heart



<P>upon you to do you good.&nbsp; I have also, that all things, that



<P>might hinder thy way to the pleasures of paradise might be



<P>taken out of the way, laid down for thee for thy soul a



<P>plenary satisfaction, and have bought thee to myself; a price



<P>not of corruptible things, as of silver and gold, but a price



<P>of blood, mine own blood, which I have freely spilled upon



<P>the ground to make thee mine.&nbsp; So I have reconciled thee, O



<P>my Mansoul, to my Father, and entrusted thee in the mansion



<P>houses that are with my Father in the royal city, where



<P>things are, O my Mansoul, that eye hath not seen, nor hath



<P>entered into the heart of man to conceive.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Besides, O my Mansoul, thou seest what I have done, and how



<P>I have taken thee out of the hands of thine enemies: unto



<P>whom thou hadst deeply revolted from my Father, and by whom



<P>thou wast content to be possessed, and also to be destroyed.



<P>I came to thee first by my law, then by my gospel, to awaken



<P>thee, and show thee my glory.&nbsp; And thou knowest what thou



<P>wast, what thou saidst, what thou didst, and how many times



<P>thou rebelledst against my Father and me; yet I left thee not



<P>as thou seest this day, but came to thee, have borne thy



<P>manners, have waited upon thee, and, after all, accepted of



<P>thee, even of my mere grace and favour; and would not suffer



<P>thee to be lost, as thou most willingly wouldst have been.&nbsp; I



<P>also compassed thee about, and afflicted thee on every side,



<P>that I might make thee weary of thy ways, and bring down thy



<P>heart with molestation to a willingness to close with thy



<P>good and happiness.&nbsp; And when I had gotten a complete



<P>conquest over thee, I turned it to thy advantage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Thou seest, also, what a company of my Father's host I have



<P>lodged within thy borders: captains and rulers, soldiers and



<P>men of war, engines and excellent devices to subdue and bring



<P>down thy foes; thou knowest my meaning, O Mansoul.&nbsp; And they



<P>are my servants, and thine, too, Mansoul.&nbsp; Yea, my design of



<P>possessing of thee with them, and the natural tendency of



<P>each of them is to defend, purge, strengthen, and sweeten



<P>thee for myself, O Mansoul, and to make thee meet for my



<P>Father's presence, blessing, and glory; for thou, my Mansoul,



<P>art created to be prepared unto these.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Thou seest, moreover, my Mansoul, how I have passed by thy



<P>backslidings, and have healed thee.&nbsp; Indeed I was angry with



<P>thee, but I have turned mine anger away from thee, because I



<P>loved thee still, and mine anger and mine indignation is



<P>ceased in the destruction of thine enemies, O Mansoul.&nbsp; Nor



<P>did thy goodness fetch me again unto thee, after that I for



<P>thy transgressions have hid my face, and withdrawn my



<P>presence from thee.&nbsp; The way of backsliding was thine, but



<P>the way and means of thy recovery was mine.&nbsp; I invented the



<P>means of thy return; it was I that made an hedge and a wall,



<P>when thou wast beginning to turn to things in which I



<P>delighted not.&nbsp; It was I that made thy sweet bitter, thy day



<P>night, thy smooth way thorny, and that also confounded all



<P>that sought thy destruction.&nbsp; It was I that set Mr. Godly-



<P>Fear to work in Mansoul.&nbsp; It was I that stirred up thy



<P>conscience and understanding, thy will and thy affections,



<P>after thy great and woful decay.&nbsp; It was I that put life into



<P>thee, O Mansoul, to seek me, that thou mightest find me, and



<P>in thy finding find thine own health, happiness, and



<P>salvation.&nbsp; It was I that fetched the second time the



<P>Diabolonians out of Mansoul; and it was I that overcame them,



<P>and that destroyed them before thy face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And now, my Mansoul, I am returned to thee in peace, and thy



<P>transgressions against me are as if they had not been.&nbsp; Nor



<P>shall it be with thee as in former days, but I will do better



<P>for thee than at thy beginning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For yet a little while, O my Mansoul, even after a few more



<P>times are gone over thy head, I will (but be not thou



<P>troubled at what I say) take down this famous town of



<P>Mansoul, stick and stone, to the ground.&nbsp; And I will carry



<P>the stones thereof, and the timber thereof, and the walls



<P>thereof, and the dust thereof, and the inhabitants thereof,



<P>into mine own country, even into a kingdom of my Father; and



<P>will there set it up in such strength and glory, as it never



<P>did see in the kingdom where now it is placed.&nbsp; I will even



<P>there set it up for my Father's habitation; for for that



<P>purpose it was at first erected in the kingdom of Universe;



<P>and there will I make it a spectacle of wonder, a monument of



<P>mercy, and the admirer of its own mercy.&nbsp; There shall the



<P>natives of Mansoul see all that, of which they have seen



<P>nothing here: there shall they be equal to those unto whom



<P>they have been inferior here.&nbsp; And there shalt thou, O my



<P>Mansoul, have such communion with me, with my Father, and



<P>with your Lord Secretary, as it is not possible here to be



<P>enjoyed, nor ever could be, shouldest thou live in Universe



<P>the space of a thousand years.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And there, O my Mansoul, thou shalt be afraid of murderers



<P>no more; of Diabolonians, and their threats, no more.&nbsp; There,



<P>there shall be no more plots, nor contrivances, nor designs



<P>against thee, O my Mansoul.&nbsp; There thou shalt no more hear



<P>the evil-tidings, or the noise of the Diabolonian drum.



<P>There thou shalt not see the Diabolonian standard-bearers,



<P>nor yet behold Diabolus's standard.&nbsp; No Diabolonian mount



<P>shall be cast up against thee there; nor shall there the



<P>Diabolonian standard be set up to make thee afraid.&nbsp; There



<P>thou shalt not need captains, engines, soldiers, and men of



<P>war.&nbsp; There thou shalt meet with no sorrow, nor grief, nor



<P>shall it be possible that any Diabolonian should again, for



<P>ever, be able to creep into thy skirts, burrow in thy walls,



<P>or be seen again within thy borders all the days of eternity.



<P>Life shall there last longer than here you are able to desire



<P>it should; and yet it shall always be sweet and new, nor



<P>shall any impediment attend it for ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'There, O Mansoul, thou shalt meet with many of those that



<P>have been like thee, and that have been partakers of thy



<P>sorrows; even such as I have chosen, and redeemed, and set



<P>apart, as thou, for my Father's court and city-royal.&nbsp; All



<P>they will be glad in thee, and thou, when thou seest them,



<P>shalt be glad in thine heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'There are things, O Mansoul, even things of my Father's



<P>providing, and mine, that never were seen since the beginning



<P>of the world; and they are laid up with my Father, and sealed



<P>up among his treasures for thee, till thou shalt come thither



<P>to enjoy them.&nbsp; I told you before, that I would remove my



<P>Mansoul, and set it up elsewhere; and where I will set it,



<P>there are those that love thee, and those that rejoice in



<P>thee now; but how much more, when they shall see thee exalted



<P>to honour!&nbsp; My Father will then send them for you to fetch



<P>you; and their bosoms are chariots to put you in.&nbsp; And you, O



<P>my Mansoul, shall ride upon the wings of the wind.&nbsp; They will



<P>come to convey, conduct, and bring you to that, when your



<P>eyes see more, that will be your desired haven.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And thus, O my Mansoul, I have showed unto thee what shall



<P>be done to thee hereafter, if thou canst hear, if thou canst



<P>understand; and now I will tell thee what at present must be



<P>thy duty and practice, until I come and fetch thee to myself,



<P>according as is related in the Scriptures of truth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'First, I charge thee that thou dost hereafter keep more



<P>white and clean the liveries which I gave thee before my last



<P>withdrawing from thee.&nbsp; Do it, I say, for this will be thy



<P>wisdom.&nbsp; They are in themselves fine linen, but thou must



<P>keep them white and clean.&nbsp; This will be your wisdom, your



<P>honour, and will be greatly for my glory.&nbsp; When your garments



<P>are white, the world will count you mine.&nbsp; Also, when your



<P>garments are white, then I am delighted in your ways; for



<P>then your goings to and fro will be like a flash of



<P>lightning, that those that are present must take notice of;



<P>also their eyes will be made to dazzle thereat.&nbsp; Deck



<P>thyself, therefore, according to my bidding, and make thyself



<P>by my law straight steps for thy feet; so shall thy King



<P>greatly desire thy beauty, for he is thy Lord, and worship



<P>thou him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Now, that thou mayest keep them as I bid thee, I have, as I



<P>before did tell thee, provided for thee an open fountain to



<P>wash thy garments in.&nbsp; Look, therefore, that thou wash often



<P>in my fountain, and go not in defiled garments; for as it is



<P>to my dishonour and my disgrace, so it will be to thy



<P>discomfort, when you shall walk in filthy garments.&nbsp; Let not,



<P>therefore, my garments, your garments, the garments that I



<P>gave thee, be defiled or spotted by the flesh.&nbsp; Keep thy



<P>garments always white, and let thy head lack no ointment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'My Mansoul, I have ofttimes delivered thee from the designs,



<P>plots, attempts, and conspiracies of Diabolus; and for all



<P>this I ask thee nothing, but that thou render not to me evil



<P>for my good; but that thou bear in mind my love, and the



<P>continuation of my kindness to my beloved Mansoul, so as to



<P>provoke thee to walk in thy measure according to the benefit



<P>bestowed on thee.&nbsp; Of old, the sacrifices were bound with



<P>coords to the horns of the altar.&nbsp; Consider what is said to



<P>thee, O my blessed Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'O my Mansoul, I have lived, I have died, I live, and will



<P>die no more for thee.&nbsp; I live, that thou mayest not die.



<P>Because I live, thou shalt live also.&nbsp; I reconciled thee to



<P>my Father by the blood of my cross; and being reconciled,



<P>thou shalt live through me.&nbsp; I will pray for thee; I will



<P>fight for thee; I will yet do thee good.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Nothing can hurt thee but sin; nothing can grieve me but



<P>sin; nothing can make thee base before thy foes but sin: take



<P>heed of sin, my Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And dost thou know why I at first, and do still, suffer



<P>Diabolonians to dwell in thy walls, O Mansoul?&nbsp; It is to keep



<P>thee wakening, to try thy love, to make thee watchful, and to



<P>cause thee yet to prize my noble captains, their soldiers,



<P>and my mercy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'It is also, that yet thou mayest be made to remember what a



<P>deplorable condition thou once wast in.&nbsp; I mean when, not



<P>some, but all did dwell, not in thy walls, but in thy castle,



<P>and in thy stronghold, O Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'O my Mansoul, should I slay all them within, many there be



<P>without, that would bring thee into bondage; for were all



<P>these within cut off, those without would find thee sleeping;



<P>and then, as in a moment, they would swallow up my Mansoul.



<P>I therefore left them in thee, not to do thee hurt (the which



<P>they yet will, if thou hearken to them, and serve them,) but



<P>to do thee good, the which they must, if thou watch and fight



<P>against them.&nbsp; Know, therefore, that whatever they shall



<P>tempt thee to, my design is, that they should drive thee, not



<P>further off, but nearer to my father, to learn thee war, to



<P>make petitioning desirable to thee, and to make thee little



<P>in thine own eyes.&nbsp; Hearken diligently to this, my Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Show me, then, thy love, my Mansoul, and let not those that



<P>are within thy walls, take thy affections off from him that



<P>hath redeemed thy soul.&nbsp; Yea, let the sight of a Diabolonian



<P>heighten thy love to me.&nbsp; I came once, and twice, and thrice,



<P>to save thee from the poison of those arrows that would have



<P>wrought thy death: stand for me, thy Friend, my Mansoul,



<P>against the Diabolonians, and I will stand for thee before my



<P>Father, and all his court.&nbsp; Love me against temptation, and I



<P>will love thee notwithstanding thine infirmities.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'O my Mansoul, remember what my captains, my soldiers, and



<P>mine engines have done for thee.&nbsp; They have fought for thee,



<P>they have suffered by thee, they have borne much at thy hands



<P>to do thee good, O Mansoul.&nbsp; Hadst thou not had them to help



<P>thee, Diabolus had certainly made a hand of thee.&nbsp; Nourish



<P>them, therefore, my Mansoul.&nbsp; When thou dost well, they will



<P>be well; when thou dost ill, they will be ill, and sick, and



<P>weak.&nbsp; Make not my captains sick, O Mansoul; for if they be



<P>sick, thou canst not be well; if they be weak, thou canst not



<P>be strong; if they be faint, thou canst not be stout and



<P>valiant for thy King, O Mansoul.&nbsp; Nor must thou think always



<P>to live by sense: thou must live upon my word.&nbsp; Thou must



<P>believe, O my Mansoul, when I am from thee, that yet I love



<P>thee, and bear thee upon mine heart for ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Remember, therefore, O my Mansoul, that thou art beloved of



<P>me: as I have, therefore, taught thee to watch, to fight, to



<P>pray, and to make war against my foes; so now I command thee



<P>to believe that my love is constant to thee.&nbsp; O my Mansoul,



<P>how have I set my heart, my love upon thee!&nbsp; Watch.&nbsp; Behold,



<P>I lay none other burden upon thee, than what thou hast



<P>already.&nbsp; Hold fast, till I come.'

<P>SOME say the 'Pilgrim's Progress' is not mine,



<P>Insinuating as if I would shine



<P>In name and fame by the worth of another,



<P>Like some made rich by robbing of their brother.



<P>Or that so fond I am of being sire,



<P>I'll father bastards; or, if need require,



<P>I'll tell a lie in print to get applause.



<P>I scorn it: John such dirt-heap never was,



<P>Since God converted him.&nbsp; Let this suffice



<P>To show why I my 'Pilgrim' patronize.



<P>It came from mine own heart, so to my head,



<P>And thence into my fingers trickled;



<P>Then to my pen, from whence immediately



<P>On paper I did dribble it daintily.



<P>Manner and matter, too, was all mine own,



<P>Nor was it unto any mortal known



<P>Till I had done it; nor did any then



<P>By books, by wits, by tongues, or hand, or pen,



<P>Add five words to it, or write half a line



<P>Thereof: the whole, and every whit is mine.



<P>Also for THIS, thine eye is now upon,



<P>The matter in this manner came from none



<P>But the same heart, and head, fingers, and pen,



<P>As did the other.&nbsp; Witness all good men;



<P>For none in all the world, without a lie,



<P>Can say that this is mine, excepting I



<P>I write not this of my ostentation,



<P>Nor 'cause I seek of men their commendation;



<P>I do it to keep them from such surmise,



<P>As tempt them will my name to scandalize.



<P>Witness my name, if anagram'd to thee,



<P>The letters make - 'Nu hony in a B.'

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>TO THE READER.</FONT></B>

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Tis strange to me, that they that love to tell



<P>Things done of old, yea, and that do excel



<P>Their equals in historiology,



<P>Speak not of Mansoul's wars, but let them lie



<P>Dead, like old fables, or such worthless things,



<P>That to the reader no advantage brings:



<P>When men, let them make what they will their own,



<P>Till they know this, are to themselves unknown.



<P>Of stories, I well know, there's divers sorts,



<P>Some foreign, some domestic; and reports



<P>Are thereof made as fancy leads the writers:



<P>(By books a man may guess at the inditers.)



<P>Some will again of that which never was,



<P>Nor will be, feign (and that without a cause)



<P>Such matter, raise such mountains, tell such things



<P>Of men, of laws, of countries, and of kings;



<P>And in their story seem to be so sage,



<P>And with such gravity clothe every page,



<P>That though their frontispiece says all is vain,



<P>Yet to their way disciples they obtain.



<P>But, readers, I have somewhat else to do,



<P>Than with vain stories thus to trouble you.



<P>What here I say, some men do know so well,



<P>They can with tears and joy the story tell.



<P>The town of Mansoul is well known to many,



<P>Nor are her troubles doubted of by any



<P>That are acquainted with those Histories



<P>That Mansoul and her wars anatomize.



<P>Then lend thine ear to what I do relate,



<P>Touching the town of Mansoul and her state:



<P>How she was lost, took captive, made a slave:



<P>And how against him set, that should her save;



<P>Yea, how by hostile ways she did oppose



<P>Her Lord, and with his enemy did close.



<P>For they are true: he that will them deny



<P>Must needs the best of records vilify.



<P>For my part, I myself was in the town,



<P>Both when 'twas set up, and when pulling down.



<P>I saw Diabolus in his possession,



<P>And Mansoul also under his oppression.



<P>Yea, I was there when she own'd him for lord,



<P>And to him did submit with one accord.



<P>When Mansoul trampled upon things divine,



<P>And wallowed in filth as doth a swine;



<P>When she betook herself unto her arms,



<P>Fought her Emmanuel, despis'd his charms;



<P>Then I was there, and did rejoice to see



<P>Diabolus and Mansoul so agree.



<P>Let no men, then, count me a fable-maker,



<P>Nor make my name or credit a partaker



<P>Of their derision: what is here in view,



<P>Of mine own knowledge, I dare say is true.



<P>I saw the Prince's armed men come down



<P>By troops, by thousands, to besiege the town;



<P>I saw the captains, heard the trumpets sound,



<P>And how his forces covered all the ground.



<P>Yea, how they set themselves in battle-'ray,



<P>I shall remember to my dying day.



<P>I saw the colours waving in the wind,



<P>And they within to mischief how combin'd



<P>To ruin Mansoul, and to make away



<P>Her primum mobile without delay.



<P>I saw the mounts cast up against the town,



<P>And how the slings were placed to beat it down:



<P>I heard the stones fly whizzing by mine ears,



<P>(What longer kept in mind than got in fears?)



<P>I heard them fall, and saw what work they made.



<P>And how old Mors did cover with his shade



<P>The face of Mansoul; and I heard her cry,



<P>'Woe worth the day, in dying I shall die!'



<P>I saw the battering-rams, and how they play'd



<P>To beat open Ear-gate; and I was afraid



<P>Not only Ear-gate, but the very town



<P>Would by those battering-rams be beaten down.



<P>I saw the fights, and heard the captains shout,



<P>And in each battle saw who faced about;



<P>I saw who wounded were, and who were slain;



<P>And who, when dead, would come to life again.



<P>I heard the cries of those that wounded were,



<P>(While others fought like men bereft of fear,)



<P>And while the cry, 'Kill, kill,' was in mine ears,



<P>The gutters ran, not so with blood as tears.



<P>Indeed, the captains did not always fight,



<P>But then they would molest us day and night;



<P>Their cry, 'Up, fall on, let us take the town,'



<P>Kept us from sleeping, or from lying down.



<P>I was there when the gates were broken ope,



<P>And saw how Mansoul then was stripp'd of hope;



<P>I saw the captains march into the town,



<P>How there they fought, and did their foes cut down.



<P>I heard the Prince bid Boanerges go



<P>Up to the castle, and there seize his foe;



<P>And saw him and his fellows bring him down,



<P>In chains of great contempt quite through the town.



<P>I saw Emmanuel, when he possess'd



<P>His town of Mansoul; and how greatly blest



<P>A town his gallant town of Mansoul was,



<P>When she received his pardon, loved his laws.



<P>When the Diabolonians were caught,



<P>When tried, and when to execution brought,



<P>Then I was there; yea, I was standing by



<P>When Mansoul did the rebels crucify.



<P>I also saw Mansoul clad all in white,



<P>I heard her Prince call her his heart's delight.



<P>I saw him put upon her chains of gold,



<P>And rings, and bracelets, goodly to behold.



<P>What shall I say?&nbsp; I heard the people's cries,



<P>And saw the Prince wipe tears from Mansoul's eyes.



<P>And heard the groans, and saw the joy of many:



<P>Tell you of all, I neither will, nor can I.



<P>But by what here I say, you well may see



<P>That Mansoul's matchless wars no fables be.



<P>Mansoul, the desire of both princes was:



<P>One keep his gain would, t'other gain his loss.



<P>Diabolus would cry, 'The town is mine!'



<P>Emmanuel would plead a right divine



<P>Unto his Mansoul: then to blows they go,



<P>And Mansoul cries, 'These wars will me undo.'



<P>Mansoul! her wars seemed endless in her eyes;



<P>She's lost by one, becomes another's prize:



<P>And he again that lost her last would swear,



<P>'Have her I will, or her in pieces tear.'



<P>Mansoul! it was the very seat of war;



<P>Wherefore her troubles greater were by far



<P>Than only where the noise of war is heard,



<P>Or where the shaking of a sword is fear'd;



<P>Or only where small skirmishes are fought,



<P>Or where the fancy fighteth with a thought.



<P>She saw the swords of fighting men made red,



<P>And heard the cries of those with them wounded:



<P>Must not her frights, then, be much more by far



<P>Than theirs that to such doings strangers are?



<P>Or theirs that hear the beating of a drum,



<P>But not made fly for fear from house and home?



<P>Mansoul not only heard the trumpet's sound,



<P>But saw her gallants gasping on the ground:



<P>Wherefore we must not think that she could rest



<P>With them, whose greatest earnest is but jest:



<P>Or where the blust'ring threat'ning of great wars



<P>Do end in parlies, or in wording jars.



<P>Mansoul! her mighty wars, they did portend



<P>Her weal or woe, and that world without end:



<P>Wherefore she must be more concern'd than they



<P>Whose fears begin, and end the selfsame day;



<P>Or where none other harm doth come to him



<P>That is engaged, but loss of life or limb,



<P>As all must needs confess that now do dwell



<P>In Universe, and can this story tell.



<P>Count me not, then, with them that, to amaze



<P>The people, set them on the stars to gaze,



<P>Insinuating with much confidence,



<P>That each of them is now the residence



<P>Of some brave creatures: yea, a world they will



<P>Have in each star, though it be past their skill



<P>To make it manifest to any man,



<P>That reason hath, or tell his fingers can.



<P>But I have too long held thee in the porch,



<P>And kept thee from the sunshine with a torch,



<P>Well, now go forward, step within the door,



<P>And there behold five hundred times much more



<P>Of all sorts of such inward rarities



<P>As please the mind will, and will feed the eyes



<P>With those, which, if a Christian, thou wilt see



<P>Not small, but things of greatest moment be.



<P>Nor do thou go to work without my key;



<P>(In mysteries men soon do lose their way;)



<P>And also turn it right, if thou wouldst know



<P>My riddle, and wouldst with my heifer plough;



<P>It lies there in the window.&nbsp; Fare thee well,



<P>My next may be to ring thy passing-bell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Now when Emmanuel perceived that through the policy of Mr.



<P>Carnal-Security the hearts of the men of Mansoul were chilled



<P>and abated in their practical love to him,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>First.&nbsp; He bemoans them, and, condoles their state with the



<P>Secretary, saying, 'Oh that my people had hearkened unto me,



<P>and that Mansoul had walked in my ways!&nbsp; I would have fed



<P>them with the finest of the wheat; and with honey out of the



<P>rock would I have sustained them.'&nbsp; This done, he said in his



<P>heart, 'I will return to the court, and go to my place, till



<P>Mansoul shall consider and acknowledge their offence.'&nbsp; And



<P>he did so, and the cause and manner of his going away from



<P>them was, that Mansoul declined him, as is manifest in these



<P>particulars.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'1. They left off their former way of visiting him, they came



<P>not to his royal palace as afore.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'2. They did not regard, nor yet take notice, that he came or



<P>came not to visit them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'3. The love-feasts that had wont to be between their Prince



<P>and them, though he made them still, and called them to them,



<P>yet they neglected to come to them, or to be delighted with



<P>them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'4. They waited not for his counsels, but began to be



<P>headstrong and confident in themselves, concluding that now



<P>they were strong and invincible, and that Mansoul was secure,



<P>and beyond all reach of the foe, and that her state must



<P>needs be unalterable for ever.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, as was said, Emmanuel perceiving that by the craft of



<P>Mr. Carnal-Security, the town of Mansoul was taken off from



<P>their dependence upon him, and upon his Father by him, and



<P>set upon what by them was bestowed upon it; he first, as I



<P>said, bemoaned their state, then he used means to make them



<P>understand that the way that they went on in was dangerous:



<P>for he sent my Lord High Secretary to them, to forbid them



<P>such ways; but twice when he came to them, he found them at



<P>dinner in Mr. Carnal-Security's parlour; and perceiving also



<P>that they were not willing to reason about matters concerning



<P>their good, he took grief and went his way; the which when he



<P>had told to the Prince Emmanuel, he took offence, and was



<P>grieved also, and so made provision to return to his Father's



<P>court.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, the methods of his withdrawing, as I was saying before,



<P>were thus:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'1. Even while he was yet with them in Mansoul, he kept



<P>himself close, and more retired than formerly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'2. His speech was not now, if he came in their company, so



<P>pleasant and familiar as formerly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'3. Nor did he, as in times past, send to Mansoul, from his



<P>table, those dainty bits which he was wont to do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'4. Nor when they came to visit him, as now and then they



<P>would, would he be so easily spoken with as they found him to



<P>be in times past.&nbsp; They might now knock once, yea, twice, but



<P>he would seem not at all to regard them; whereas formerly at



<P>the sound of their feet he would up and run, and meet them



<P>halfway, and take them too, and lay them in his bosom.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But thus Emmanuel carried it now, and by this his carriage he



<P>sought to make them bethink themselves, and return to him.



<P>But, alas! they did not consider, they did not know his ways,



<P>they regarded not, they were not touched with these, nor with



<P>the true remembrance of former favours.&nbsp; Wherefore what does



<P>he but in private manner withdraw himself, first from his



<P>palace, then to the gate of the town, and so away from



<P>Mansoul he goes, till they should acknowledge their offence,



<P>and more earnestly seek his face.&nbsp; Mr. God's-Peace also laid



<P>down his commission, and would for the present act no longer



<P>in the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thus they walked contrary to him, and he again, by way of



<P>retaliation, walked contrary to them.&nbsp; But, alas! by this



<P>time they were so hardened in their way, and had so drunk in



<P>the doctrine of Mr. Carnal-Security, that the departing of



<P>their Prince touched them not, nor was he remembered by them



<P>when gone; and so, of consequence, his absence not condoled



<P>by them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, there was a day wherein this old gentleman, Mr. Carnal-



<P>Security, did again make a feast for the town of Mansoul; and



<P>there was at that time in the town one Mr. Godly-Fear, one



<P>now but little set by, though formerly one of great request.



<P>This man, old Carnal-Security, had a mind, if possible, to



<P>gull, and debauch, and abuse, as he did the rest, and



<P>therefore he now bids him to the feast with his neighbours.



<P>So the day being come, they prepare, and he goes and appears



<P>with the rest of the guests; and being all set at the table,



<P>they did eat and drink, and were merry, even all but this one



<P>man: for Mr. Godly-Fear sat like a stranger, and did neither



<P>eat nor was merry.&nbsp; The which, when Mr. Carnal-Security



<P>perceived, he presently addressed himself in a speech thus to



<P>him:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Mr. Godly-Fear, are you not well?&nbsp; You seem to be ill of



<P>body or mind, or both.&nbsp; I have a cordial of Mr. Forget-Good's



<P>making, the which, sir, if you will take a dram of, I hope it



<P>may make you bonny and blithe, and so make you more fit for



<P>us, feasting companions.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Unto whom the good old gentleman discreetly replied, 'Sir, I



<P>thank you for all things courteous and civil; but for your



<P>cordial I have no list thereto.&nbsp; But a word to the natives of



<P>Mansoul: You, the elders and chief of Mansoul, to me it is



<P>strange to see you so jocund and merry, when the town of



<P>Mansoul is in such woeful case.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Mr. Carnal-Security, 'You want sleep, good air, I



<P>doubt.&nbsp; If you please, lie down, and take a nap, and we



<P>meanwhile will be merry.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the good man as follows: 'Sir, if you were not



<P>destitute of an honest heart, you could not do as you have



<P>done and do.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Mr. Carnal-Security, 'Why?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>GODLY.&nbsp; Nay, pray interrupt me not.&nbsp; It is true the town of



<P>Mansoul was strong, and, with a PROVISO, impregnable; but



<P>you, the townsmen, have weakened it, and it now lies



<P>obnoxious to its foes.&nbsp; Nor is it a time to flatter, or be



<P>silent; it is you, Mr. Carnal-Security, that have wilily



<P>stripped Mansoul, and driven her glory from her; you have



<P>pulled down her towers, you have broken down her gates, you



<P>have spoiled her locks and bars.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And now, to explain myself: from that time that my lords of



<P>Mansoul, and you, sir, grew so great, from that time the



<P>Strength of Mansoul has been offended, and now he is arisen



<P>and is gone.&nbsp; If any shall question the truth of my words, I



<P>will answer him by this, and suchlike questions.&nbsp; 'Where is



<P>the Prince Emmanuel?&nbsp; When did a man or woman in Mansoul see



<P>him?&nbsp; When did you hear from him, or taste any of his dainty



<P>bits?'&nbsp; You are now a feasting with this Diabolonian monster,



<P>but he is not your Prince.&nbsp; I say, therefore, though enemies



<P>from without, had you taken heed, could not have made a prey



<P>of you, yet since you have sinned against your Prince, your



<P>enemies within have been too hard for you.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Mr. Carnal-Security, 'Fie! fie!&nbsp; Mr. Godly-Fear,



<P>fie! - will you never shake off your TIMOROUSNESS?&nbsp; Are you



<P>afraid of being sparrow-blasted?&nbsp; Who hath hurt you?&nbsp; Behold,



<P>I am on your side; only you are for doubting, and I am for



<P>being confident.&nbsp; Besides, is this a time to be sad in?&nbsp; A



<P>feast is made for mirth; why, then, do you now, to your



<P>shame, and our trouble, break out into such passionate



<P>melancholy language, when you should eat and drink, and be



<P>merry?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Mr. Godly-Fear again, 'I may well be sad, for



<P>Emmanuel is gone from Mansoul.&nbsp; I say again, he is gone, and



<P>you, sir, are the man that has driven him away; yea, he is



<P>gone without so much as acquainting the nobles of Mansoul



<P>with his going; and if that is not a sign of his anger, I am



<P>not acquainted with the methods of godliness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And now, my lords and gentlemen, for my speech is still to



<P>you, your gradual declining from him did provoke him



<P>gradually to depart from you, the which he did for some time,



<P>if perhaps you would have been made sensible thereby, and



<P>have been renewed by humbling yourselves; but when he saw



<P>that none would regard, nor lay these fearful beginnings of



<P>his anger and judgment to heart, he went away from this



<P>place; and this I saw with mine eye.&nbsp; Wherefore now, while



<P>you boast, your strength is gone; you are like the man that



<P>had lost his locks that before did wave about his shoulders.



<P>You may, with this lord of your feast, shake yourselves, and



<P>conclude to do as at other times; but since without him you



<P>can do nothing, and he is departed from you, turn your feast



<P>into a sigh, and your mirth into lamentation.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then the subordinate preacher, old Mr. Conscience by name, he



<P>that of old was Recorder of Mansoul, being startled at what



<P>was said, began to second it thus:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Indeed, my brethren,' quoth he, 'I fear that Mr. Godly-Fear



<P>tells us true: I, for my part, have not seen my Prince a long



<P>season.&nbsp; I cannot remember the day, for my part; nor can I



<P>answer Mr. Godly-Fear's question.&nbsp; I doubt, I am afraid that



<P>all is nought with Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>GODLY.&nbsp; Nay, I know that you shall not find him in Mansoul,



<P>for he is departed and gone; yea, and gone for the faults of



<P>the elders, and for that they rewarded his grace with



<P>unsufferable unkindness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then did the subordinate preacher look as if he would fall



<P>down dead at the table; also all there present, except the



<P>man of the house, began to look pale and wan.&nbsp; But having a



<P>little recovered themselves, and jointly agreeing to believe



<P>Mr. Godly-Fear and his sayings, they began to consult what



<P>was best to be done, (now Mr. Carnal-Security was gone into



<P>his withdrawing-room, for he liked not such dumpish doings,)



<P>both to the man of the house for drawing them into evil, and



<P>also to recover Emmanuel's love.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And, with that, that saying of their Prince came very hot



<P>into their minds, which he had bidden them do to such as were



<P>false prophets that should arise to delude the town of



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; So they took Mr. Carnal-Security (concluding that



<P>he must be he) and burned his house upon him with fire; for



<P>he also was a Diabolonian by nature.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So when this was passed and over, they bespeed themselves to



<P>look for Emmanuel their Prince; and they sought him, but they



<P>found him not.&nbsp; Then were they more confirmed in the truth of



<P>Mr. Godly-Fear's sayings, and began also severely to reflect



<P>upon themselves for their so vile and ungodly doings; for



<P>they concluded now that it was through them that their Prince



<P>had left them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then they agreed and went to my Lord Secretary, (him whom



<P>before they refused to hear - him whom they had grieved with



<P>their doings,) to know of him, for he was a seer, and could



<P>tell where Emmanuel was, and how they might direct a petition



<P>to him.&nbsp; But the Lord Secretary would not admit them to a



<P>conference about this matter, nor would admit them to his



<P>royal place of abode, nor come out to them to show them his



<P>face or intelligence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And now was it a day gloomy and dark, a day of clouds and of



<P>thick darkness with Mansoul.&nbsp; Now they saw that they had been



<P>foolish, and began to perceive what the company and prattle



<P>of Mr. Carnal-Security had done, and what desperate damage



<P>his swaggering words had brought poor Mansoul into.&nbsp; But what



<P>further it was likely to cost them they were ignorant of.



<P>Now Mr. Godly-Fear began again to be in repute with the men



<P>of the town; yea, they were ready to look upon him as a



<P>prophet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, when the Sabbath day was come, they went to hear their



<P>subordinate preacher; but oh, how he did thunder and lighten



<P>this day!&nbsp; His text was that in the prophet Jonah: 'They that



<P>observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.'&nbsp; But there



<P>was then such power and authority in that sermon, and such a



<P>dejection seen in the countenances of the people that day,



<P>that the like hath seldom been heard or seen.&nbsp; The people,



<P>when sermon was done, were scarce able to go to their homes,



<P>or to betake themselves to their employs the week after; they



<P>were so sermon-smitten, and also so sermon-sick by being



<P>smitten, that they knew not what to do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He did not only show to Mansoul their sin, but did tremble



<P>before them, under the sense of his own, still crying out of



<P>himself, as he preached to them, 'Unhappy man that I am! that



<P>I should do so wicked a thing!&nbsp; That I, a preacher! whom the



<P>Prince did set up to teach to Mansoul his law, should myself



<P>live senseless and sottishly here, and be one of the first



<P>found in transgression!&nbsp; This transgression also fell within



<P>my precincts; I should have cried out against the wickedness;



<P>but I let Mansoul lie wallowing in it, until it had driven



<P>Emmanuel from its borders!'&nbsp; With these things he also



<P>charged all the lords and gentry of Mansoul, to the almost



<P>distracting of them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>About this time, also, there was a great sickness in the town



<P>of Mansoul, and most of the inhabitants were greatly



<P>afflicted.&nbsp; Yea, the captains also, and men of war, were



<P>brought thereby to a languishing condition, and that for a



<P>long time together; so that in case of an invasion, nothing



<P>could to purpose now have been done, either by the townsmen



<P>or field officers.&nbsp; Oh, how many pale faces, weak hands,



<P>feeble knees, and staggering men were now seen to walk the



<P>streets of Mansoul!&nbsp; Here were groans, there pants, and



<P>yonder lay those that were ready to faint.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The garments, too, which Emmanuel had given them were but in



<P>a sorry case; some were rent, some were torn, and all in a



<P>nasty condition; some also did hang so loosely upon them,



<P>that the next bush they came at was ready to pluck them off.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After some time spent in this sad and desolate condition, the



<P>subordinate preacher called for a day of fasting, and to



<P>humble themselves for being so wicked against the great



<P>Shaddai and his Son.&nbsp; And he desired that Captain Boanerges



<P>would preach.&nbsp; So he consented to do it; and the day being



<P>come, and his text was this, 'Cut it down, why cumbereth it



<P>the ground?'&nbsp; And a very smart sermon he made upon the place.



<P>First, he showed what was the occasion of the words, namely,



<P>because the fig-tree was barren; then he showed what was



<P>contained in the sentence, namely, repentance, or utter



<P>desolation.&nbsp; He then showed, also, by whose authority this



<P>sentence was pronounced, and that was by Shaddai himself.



<P>And, lastly, he showed the reasons of the point, and then



<P>concluded his sermon.&nbsp; But he was very pertinent in the



<P>application, insomuch that he made poor Mansoul tremble.&nbsp; For



<P>this sermon, as well as the former, wrought much upon the



<P>hearts of the men of Mansoul; yea, it greatly helped to keep



<P>awake those that were roused by the preaching that went



<P>before.&nbsp; So that now throughout the whole town, there was



<P>little or nothing to be heard or seen but sorrow, and



<P>mourning, and woe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, after sermon, they got together and consulted what was



<P>best to be done.&nbsp; 'But,' said the subordinate preacher, 'I



<P>will do nothing of mine own head, without advising with my



<P>neighbour Mr. Godly-Fear.&nbsp; For if he had aforehand understood



<P>more of the mind of our Prince than we, I do not know but he



<P>also may have it now, even now we are turning again to



<P>virtue.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So they called and sent for Mr. Godly-Fear, and he forthwith



<P>appeared.&nbsp; Then they desired that he would further show his



<P>opinion about what they had best to do. Then said the old



<P>gentleman as followeth: 'It is my opinion that this town of



<P>Mansoul should, in this day of her distress, draw up and send



<P>an humble petition to their offended Prince Emmanuel, that



<P>he, in his favour and grace, will turn again unto you, and



<P>not keep anger for ever.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the townsmen had heard this speech, they did, with one



<P>consent, agree to his advice; so they did presently draw up



<P>their request, and the next was, But who shall carry it?&nbsp; At



<P>last they did all agree to send it by my Lord Mayor.&nbsp; So he



<P>accepted of the service, and addressed himself to his



<P>journey; and went and came to the court of Shaddai, whither



<P>Emmanuel the Prince of Mansoul was gone.&nbsp; But the gate was



<P>shut, and a strict watch kept thereat; so that the petitioner



<P>was forced to stand without for a great while together.&nbsp; Then



<P>he desired that some would go into the Prince and tell him



<P>who stood at the gate, and what his business was.&nbsp; So one



<P>went and told to Shaddai, and to Emmanuel his Son, that the



<P>Lord Mayor of the town of Mansoul stood without at the gate



<P>of the King's court, desiring to be admitted into the



<P>presence of the Prince, the King's Son.&nbsp; He also told what



<P>was the Lord Mayor's errand, both to the King and his Son



<P>Emmanuel.&nbsp; But the Prince would not come down, nor admit that



<P>the gate should be opened to him, but sent him an answer to



<P>this effect: 'They have turned their back unto me, and not



<P>their face; but now in the time of their trouble they say to



<P>me, Arise, and save us.&nbsp; But can they not now go to Mr.



<P>Carnal-Security, to whom they went when they turned from me,



<P>and make him their leader, their lord, and their protection



<P>now in their trouble; why now in their trouble do they visit



<P>me, since in their prosperity they went astray?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The answer made my Lord Mayor look black in the face; it



<P>troubled, it perplexed, it rent him sore.&nbsp; And now he began



<P>again to see what it was to be familiar with Diabolonians,



<P>such as Mr. Carnal-Security was.&nbsp; When he saw that at court,



<P>as yet, there was little help to be expected, either for



<P>himself or friends in Mansoul, he smote upon his breast, and



<P>returned weeping, and all the way bewailing the lamentable



<P>state of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, when he was come within sight of the town, the elders



<P>and chief of the people of Mansoul went out at the gate to



<P>meet him, and to salute him, and to know how he sped at



<P>court.&nbsp; But he told them his tale in so doleful a manner,



<P>that they all cried out, and mourned, and wept.&nbsp; Wherefore



<P>they threw ashes and dust upon their heads, and put sackcloth



<P>upon their loins, and went crying out through the town of



<P>Mansoul; the which, when the rest of the townsfolk saw, they



<P>all mourned and wept.&nbsp; This, therefore, was a day of rebuke



<P>and trouble, and of anguish to the town of Mansoul, and also



<P>of great distress.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After some time, when they had somewhat refrained themselves,



<P>they came together to consult again what by them was yet to



<P>be done; and they asked advice, as they did before, of that



<P>reverend Mr. Godly-Fear, who told them that there was no way



<P>better than to do as they had done, nor would he that they



<P>should be discouraged at all with that they had met with at



<P>court; yea, though several of their petitions should be



<P>answered with nought but silence or rebuke: 'For,' said he,



<P>'it is the way of the wise Shaddai to make men wait and to



<P>exercise patience, and it should be the way of them in want,



<P>to be willing to stay his leisure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then they took courage, and sent again and again, and again,



<P>and again; for there was not now one day, nor an hour that



<P>went over Mansoul's head, wherein a man might not have met



<P>upon the road one or other riding post, sounding the horn



<P>from Mansoul to the court of the King Shaddai; and all with



<P>letters petitionary in behalf of, and for the Prince's return



<P>to Mansoul.&nbsp; The road, I say, was now full of messengers,



<P>going and returning, and meeting one another; some from the



<P>court, and some from Mansoul; and this was the work of the



<P>miserable town of Mansoul, all that long, that sharp, that



<P>cold and tedious winter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now if you have not forgot, you may yet remember that I told



<P>you before, that after Emmanuel had taken Mansoul, yea, and



<P>after that he had new modelled the town, there remained in



<P>several lurking places of the corporation many of the old



<P>Diabolonians, that either came with the tyrant when he



<P>invaded and took the town, or that had there, by reason of



<P>unlawful mixtures, their birth and breeding, and bringing up.



<P>And their holes, dens, and lurking places were in, under, or



<P>about the wall of the town.&nbsp; Some of their names are the Lord



<P>Fornication, the Lord Adultery, the Lord Murder, the Lord



<P>Anger, the Lord Lasciviousness, the Lord Deceit, the Lord



<P>Evil-eye, the Lord Blasphemy, and that horrible villain, the



<P>old and dangerous Lord Covetousness.&nbsp; These, as I told you,



<P>with many more, had yet their abode in the town of Mansoul,



<P>and that after that Emmanuel had driven their prince Diabolus



<P>out of the castle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Against these the good Prince did grant a commission to the



<P>Lord Willbewill and others, yea, to the whole town of



<P>Mansoul, to seek, take, secure, and destroy any or all that



<P>they could lay hands of, for that they were Diabolonians by



<P>nature, enemies to the Prince, and those that sought to ruin



<P>the blessed town of Mansoul.&nbsp; But the town of Mansoul did not



<P>pursue this warrant, but neglected to look after, to



<P>apprehend, to secure, and to destroy these Diabolonians.



<P>Wherefore what do these villains but by degrees take courage



<P>to put forth their heads, and to show themselves to the



<P>inhabitants of the town.&nbsp; Yea, and as I was told, some of the



<P>men of Mansoul grew too familiar with some of them, to the



<P>sorrow of the corporation, as you yet will hear more of in



<P>time and place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, when the Diabolonian lords that were left perceived



<P>that Mansoul had, through sinning, offended Emmanuel their



<P>Prince, and that he had withdrawn himself and was gone, what



<P>do they but plot the ruin of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; So upon a



<P>time they met together at the hold of one Mr. Mischief, who



<P>was also a Diabolonian, and there consulted how they might



<P>deliver up Mansoul into the hands of Diabolus again.&nbsp; Now



<P>some advised one way, and some another, every man according



<P>to his own liking.&nbsp; At last my Lord Lasciviousness



<P>propounded, whether it might not be best, in the first place,



<P>for some of those that were Diabolonians in Mansoul, to



<P>adventure to offer themselves for servants to some of the



<P>natives of the town; 'for,' said he, 'if they so do, and



<P>Mansoul shall accept of them, they may for us, and for



<P>Diabolus our Lord, make the taking of the town of Mansoul



<P>more easy than otherwise it will be.'&nbsp; But then stood up the



<P>Lord Murder, and said, 'This may not be done at this time;



<P>for Mansoul is now in a kind of a rage, because by our



<P>friend, Mr. Carnal-Security, she hath been once ensnared



<P>already, and made to offend against her Prince; and how shall



<P>she reconcile herself unto her lord again, but by the heads



<P>of these men?&nbsp; Besides, we know that they have in commission



<P>to take and slay us wherever they shall find us; let us,



<P>therefore, be wise as foxes: when we are dead, we can do them



<P>no hurt; but while we live, we may.'&nbsp; Thus, when they had



<P>tossed the matter to and fro, they jointly agreed that a



<P>letter should forthwith be sent away to Diabolus in their



<P>name, by which the state of the town of Mansoul should be



<P>showed him, and how much it is under the frowns of their



<P>Prince.&nbsp; 'We may also,' said some, 'let him know our



<P>intentions, and ask of him his advice in the case.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So a letter was presently framed, the contents of which were



<P>these:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'To our great lord, the Prince Diabolus, dwelling below in



<P>the infernal cave:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'O great father, and mighty Prince Diabolus, we, the true



<P>Diabolonians yet remaining in the rebellious town of Mansoul,



<P>having received our beings from thee, and our nourishment at



<P>thy hands, cannot with content and quiet endure to behold, as



<P>we do this day, how thou art dispraised, disgraced, and



<P>reproached among the inhabitants of this town; nor is thy



<P>long absence at all delightful to us, because greatly to our



<P>detriment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'The reason of this our writing unto our lord, is for that we



<P>are not altogether without hope that this town may become thy



<P>habitation again; for it is greatly declined from its Prince



<P>Emmanuel; and he is uprisen, and is departed from them: yea,



<P>and though they send, and send, and send, and send after him



<P>to return to them, yet can they not prevail, nor get good



<P>words from him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'There has been also of late, and is yet remaining, a very



<P>great sickness and fainting among them; and that not only



<P>upon the poorer sort of the town, but upon the lords,



<P>captains, and chief gentry of the place, (we only who are of



<P>the Diabolonians by nature remain well, lively, and strong,)



<P>so that through their great transgression on the one hand,



<P>and their dangerous sickness on the other, we judge they lie



<P>open to thy hand and power.&nbsp; If, therefore, it shall stand



<P>with thy horrible cunning, and with the cunning of the rest



<P>of the princes with thee, to come and make an attempt to take



<P>Mansoul again, send us word, and we shall to our utmost power



<P>be ready to deliver it into thy hand.&nbsp; Or if what we have



<P>said shall not by thy fatherhood be thought best and most



<P>meet to be done, send us thy mind in a few words, and we are



<P>all ready to follow thy counsel to the hazarding of our



<P>lives, and what else we have.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Given under our hands the day and date above-written, after



<P>a close consultation at the house of Mr. Mischief, who yet is



<P>alive and hath his place in our desirable town of Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Mr. Profane (for he was the carrier) was come with his



<P>letter to Hell-Gate Hill, he knocked at the brazen gates for



<P>entrance.&nbsp; Then did Cerberus, the porter, for he is the



<P>keeper of that gate, open to Mr. Profane, to whom he



<P>delivered his letter, which he had brought from the



<P>Diabolonians in Mansoul.&nbsp; So he carried it in, and presented



<P>it to Diabolus his lord, and said, 'Tidings, my lord, from



<P>Mansoul, from our trusty friends in Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then came together from all places of the den Beelzebub,



<P>Lucifer, Apollyon, with the rest of the rabblement there, to



<P>hear what news from Mansoul.&nbsp; So the letter was broken up and



<P>read, and Cerberus he stood by.&nbsp; When the letter was openly



<P>read, and the contents thereof spread into all the corners of



<P>the den, command was given that, without let or stop, dead-



<P>man's bell should be rung for joy.&nbsp; So the bell was rung, and



<P>the princes rejoiced that Mansoul was likely to come to ruin.



<P>Now, the clapper of the bell went, 'The town of Mansoul is



<P>coming to dwell with us: make room for the town of Mansoul.'



<P>This bell therefore they did ring, because they did hope that



<P>they should have Mansoul again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when they had performed this their horrible ceremony,



<P>they got together again to consult what answer to send to



<P>their friends in Mansoul; and some advised one thing, and



<P>some another: but at length, because the business required



<P>haste, they left the whole business to the prince Diabolus,



<P>judging him the most proper lord of the place.&nbsp; So he drew up



<P>a letter as he thought fit, in answer to what Mr. Profane had



<P>brought, and sent it to the Diabolonians that did dwell in



<P>Mansoul, by the same hand that had brought theirs to him; and



<P>these were the contents thereof:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'To our offspring, the high and mighty Diabolonians that yet



<P>dwell in the town of Mansoul, Diabolus, the great prince of



<P>Mansoul, wisheth a prosperous issue and conclusion of those



<P>many brave enterprises, conspiracies, and designs, that you,



<P>of your love and respect to our honour, have in your hearts



<P>to attempt to do against Mansoul.&nbsp; Beloved children and



<P>disciples, my Lord Fornication, Adultery, and the rest, we



<P>have here, in our desolate den, received, to our highest joy



<P>and content, your welcome letter, by the hand of our trusty



<P>Mr. Profane; and to show how acceptable your tidings were, we



<P>rang out our bell for gladness; for we rejoiced as much as we



<P>could, when we perceived that yet we had friends in Mansoul,



<P>and such as sought our honour and revenge in the ruin of the



<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; We also rejoiced to hear that they are in a



<P>degenerated condition, and that they have offended their



<P>Prince, and that he is gone.&nbsp; Their sickness also pleaseth



<P>us, as does also your health, might, and strength.&nbsp; Glad also



<P>would we be, right horribly beloved, could we get this town



<P>into our clutches again.&nbsp; Nor will we be sparing of spending



<P>our wit, our cunning, our craft, and hellish inventions to



<P>bring to a wished conclusion this your brave beginning in



<P>order thereto.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And take this for your comfort, (our birth, and our



<P>offspring,) that shall we again surprise it and take it, we



<P>will attempt to put all your foes to the sword, and will make



<P>you the great lords and captains of the place.&nbsp; Nor need you



<P>fear, if ever we get it again, that we after that shall be



<P>cast out any more; for we will come with more strength, and



<P>so lay far more fast hold than at the first we did.&nbsp; Besides,



<P>it is the law of that Prince that now they own, that if we



<P>get them a second time, they shall be ours for ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Do you, therefore, our trusty Diabolonians, yet more pry



<P>into, and endeavour to spy out the weakness of the town of



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; We also would that you yourselves do attempt to



<P>weaken them more and more.&nbsp; Send us word also by what means



<P>you think we had best to attempt the regaining thereof:



<P>namely, whether by persuasion to a vain and loose life; or,



<P>whether by tempting them to doubt and despair; or, whether by



<P>blowing up of the town by the gunpowder of pride, and self-



<P>conceit.&nbsp; Do you also, O ye brave Diabolonians, and true sons



<P>of the pit, be always in a readiness to make a most hideous



<P>assault within, when we shall be ready to storm it without.



<P>Now speed you in your project, and we in our desires, to the



<P>utmost power of our gates, which is the wish of your great



<P>Diabolus, Mansoul's enemy, and him that trembles when he



<P>thinks of judgment to come.&nbsp; All the blessings of the pit be



<P>upon you, and so we close up our letter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Given at the pit's mouth, by the joint consent of all the



<P>princes of darkness, to be sent, to the force and power that



<P>we have yet remaining in Mansoul, by the hand of Mr. Profane,



<P>by me, Diabolus.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This letter, as was said, was sent to Mansoul, to the



<P>Diabolonians that yet remained there, and that yet inhabited



<P>the wall, from the dark dungeon of Diabolus, by the hand of



<P>Mr. Profane, by whom they also in Mansoul sent theirs to the



<P>pit.&nbsp; Now, when this Mr. Profane had made his return, and was



<P>come to Mansoul again, he went and came as he was wont to the



<P>house of Mr. Mischief, for there was the conclave, and the



<P>place where the contrivers were met.&nbsp; Now, when they saw that



<P>their messenger was returned safe and sound, they were



<P>greatly gladded thereat.&nbsp; Then he presented them with his



<P>letter which he had brought from Diabolus for them; the



<P>which, when they had read and considered, did much augment



<P>their gladness.&nbsp; They asked him after the welfare of their



<P>friends, as how their Lord Diabolus, Lucifer, and Beelzebub



<P>did, with the rest of those of the den.&nbsp; To which this



<P>Profane made answer, 'Well, well, my lords; they are well,



<P>even as well as can be in their place.&nbsp; They also,' said he,



<P>'did ring for joy at the reading of your letter, as you well



<P>perceived by this when you read it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, as was said, when they had read their letter, and



<P>perceived that it encouraged them in their work, they fell to



<P>their way of contriving again, namely, how they might



<P>complete their Diabolonian design upon Mansoul.&nbsp; And the



<P>first thing that they agreed upon was to keep all things from



<P>Mansoul as close as they could.&nbsp; 'Let it not be known, let



<P>not Mansoul be acquainted with what we design against it.'



<P>The next thing was, how, or by what means, they should try to



<P>bring to pass the ruin and overthrow of Mansoul; and one said



<P>after this manner, and another said after that.&nbsp; Then stood



<P>up Mr. Deceit, and said, 'My right Diabolonian friends, our



<P>lords, and the high ones of the deep dungeon, do propound



<P>unto us these three ways.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'1. Whether we had best to seek its ruin by making Mansoul



<P>loose and vain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'2. Or whether by driving them to doubt and despair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'3. Or whether by endeavouring to blow them up by the



<P>gunpowder of pride and self-conceit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Now, I think, if we shall tempt them to pride, that may do



<P>something; and if we tempt them to wantonness, that may help.



<P>But, in my mind, if we could drive them into desperation,



<P>that would knock the nail on the head; for then we should



<P>have them, in the first place, question the truth of the love



<P>of the heart of their Prince towards them, and that will



<P>disgust him much.&nbsp; This, if it works well, will make them



<P>leave off quickly their way of sending petitions to him; then



<P>farewell earnest solicitations for help and supply; for then



<P>this conclusion lies naturally before them, "As good do



<P>nothing, as do to no purpose."'&nbsp; So to Mr. Deceit they



<P>unanimously did consent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then the next question was, But how shall we do to bring this



<P>our project to pass? and it was answered by the same



<P>gentleman - that this might be the best way to do it: 'Even



<P>let,' quoth he, 'so many of our friends as are willing to



<P>venture themselves for the promoting of their prince's cause,



<P>disguise themselves with apparel, change their names, and go



<P>into the market like far country-men, and proffer to let



<P>themselves for servants to the famous town of Mansoul, and



<P>let them pretend to do for their masters as beneficially as



<P>may be; for by so doing they may, if Mansoul shall hire them,



<P>in little time so corrupt and defile the corporation, that



<P>her now Prince shall be not only further offended with them,



<P>but in conclusion shall spue them out of his mouth.&nbsp; And when



<P>this is done, our prince Diabolus shall prey upon them with



<P>ease: yea, of themselves they shall fall into the mouth of



<P>the cater.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This project was no sooner propounded, but was as highly



<P>accepted, and forward were all Diabolonians now to engage in



<P>so delicate an enterprise: but it was not thought fit that



<P>all should do thus; wherefore they pitched upon two or three,



<P>namely, the Lord Covetousness, the Lord Lasciviousness, and



<P>the Lord Anger.&nbsp; The Lord Covetousness called himself by the



<P>name of Prudent-Thrifty; the Lord Lasciviousness called



<P>himself by the name of Harmless-Mirth; and the Lord Anger



<P>called himself by the name of Good-Zeal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So upon a market-day they came into the market-place, three



<P>lusty fellows they were to look on, and they were clothed in



<P>sheep's russet, which was also now in a manner as white as



<P>were the white robes of the men of Mansoul.&nbsp; Now the men



<P>could speak the language of Mansoul well.&nbsp; So when they were



<P>come into the market-place, and had offered to let themselves



<P>to the townsmen, they were presently taken up; for they asked



<P>but little wages, and promised to do their masters great



<P>service.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Mind hired Prudent-Thrifty, and Mr. Godly-Fear hired



<P>Good-Zeal.&nbsp; True, this fellow Harmless-Mirth did hang a



<P>little in hand, and could not so soon get him a master as the



<P>others did, because the town of Mansoul was now in Lent, but



<P>after a while, because Lent was almost out, the Lord



<P>Willbewill hired Harmless-Mirth to be both his waiting man



<P>and his lackey: and thus they got them masters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;These villains now being got thus far into the houses of the



<P>men of Mansoul, quickly began to do great mischief therein;



<P>for, being filthy, arch, and sly, they quickly corrupted the



<P>families where they were; yea, they tainted their masters



<P>much, especially this Prudent-Thrifty, and him they call



<P>Harmless-Mirth.&nbsp; True, he that went under the visor of Good-



<P>Zeal, was not so well liked of his master; for he quickly



<P>found that he was but a counterfeit rascal; the which when



<P>the fellow perceived, with speed he made his escape from the



<P>house, or I doubt not but his master had hanged him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, when these vagabonds had thus far carried on their



<P>design, and had corrupted the town as much as they could, in



<P>the next place they considered with themselves at what time



<P>their prince Diabolus without, and themselves within the



<P>town, should make an attempt to seize upon Mansoul; and they



<P>all agreed upon this, that a market-day would be best for



<P>that work; for why?&nbsp; Then will the townsfolk be busy in their



<P>ways: and always take this for a rule, when people are most



<P>busy in the world, they least fear a surprise.&nbsp; 'We also



<P>then,' said they, 'shall be able with less suspicion to



<P>gather ourselves together for the work of our friends and



<P>lords; yea, and in such a day, if we shall attempt our work,



<P>and miss it, we may, when they shall give us the rout, the



<P>better hide ourselves in the crowd, and escape.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These things being thus far agreed upon by them, they wrote



<P>another letter to Diabolus, and sent it by the hand to Mr.



<P>Profane, the contents of which were these:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'The lords of Looseness send to the great and high Diabolus



<P>from our dens, caves, holes, and strongholds, in and about



<P>the wall of the town of Mansoul, greeting:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Our great lord, and the nourisher of our lives, Diabolus -



<P>how glad we were when we heard of your fatherhood's readiness



<P>to comply with us, and help forward our design in our



<P>attempts to ruin Mansoul, none can tell but those who, as we



<P>do, set themselves against all appearance of good, when and



<P>wheresoever we find it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Touching the encouragement that your greatness is pleased to



<P>give us to continue to devise, contrive, and study the utter



<P>desolation of Mansoul, that we are not solicitous about: for



<P>we know right well that it cannot but be pleasing and



<P>profitable to us to see our enemies, and them that seek our



<P>lives, die at our feet, or fly before us.&nbsp; We therefore are



<P>still contriving, and that to the best of our cunning, to



<P>make this work most facile and easy to your lordships, and to



<P>us.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'First, we considered of that most hellishly cunning,



<P>compacted, threefold project, that by you was propounded to



<P>us in your last; and have concluded, that though to blow them



<P>up with the gunpowder of pride would do well, and to do it by



<P>tempting them to be loose and vain will help on, yet to



<P>contrive to bring them into the gulf of desperation, we think



<P>will do best of all.&nbsp; Now we, who are at your beck, have



<P>thought or two ways to do this: first we, for our parts, will



<P>make them as vile as we can, and then you with us, at a time



<P>appointed, shall be ready to fall upon them with the utmost



<P>force.&nbsp; And of all the nations that are at your whistle, we



<P>think that an army of doubters may be the most likely to



<P>attack and overcome the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Thus shall we



<P>overcome these enemies, else the pit shall open her mouth



<P>upon them, and desperation shall thrust them down into it.



<P>We have also, to effect this so much by us desired design,



<P>sent already three of our trusty Diabolonians among them;



<P>they are disguised in garb, they have changed their names,



<P>and are now accepted of them; namely, Covetousness,



<P>Lasciviousness, and Anger.&nbsp; The name of Covetousness is



<P>changed to Prudent-Thrifty, and him Mr. Mind has hired, and



<P>is almost become as bad as our friend.&nbsp; Lasciviousness has



<P>changed his name to Harmless-Mirth, and he is got to be the



<P>Lord Willbewill's lackey; but he has made his master very



<P>wanton.&nbsp; Anger changed his name into Good-Zeal, and was



<P>entertained by Mr. Godly-Fear; but the peevish old gentleman



<P>took pepper in the nose, and turned our companion out of his



<P>house.&nbsp; Nay, he has informed us since that he ran away from



<P>him, or else his old master had hanged him up for his labour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Now these have much helped forward our work and design upon



<P>Mansoul; for notwithstanding the spite and quarrelsome temper



<P>of the old gentleman last mentioned, the other two ply their



<P>business well, and are likely to ripen the work apace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Our next project is, that it be concluded that you come upon



<P>the town upon a market-day, and that when they are upon the



<P>heat of their business; for then, to be sure, they will be



<P>most secure, and least think that an assault will be made



<P>upon them.&nbsp; They will also at such a time be less able to



<P>defend themselves, and to offend you in the prosecution of



<P>our design.&nbsp; And we your trusty (and we are sure your



<P>beloved) ones shall, when you shall make your furious assault



<P>without, be ready to second the business within.&nbsp; So shall



<P>we, in all likelihood, be able to put Mansoul to utter



<P>confusion, and to swallow them up before they can come to



<P>themselves.&nbsp; If your serpentine heads, most subtile dragons,



<P>and our highly esteemed lords can find out a better way than



<P>this, let us quickly know your minds.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'To the monsters of the infernal cave, from the house of Mr.



<P>Mischief in Mansoul, by the hand of Mr. Profane.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now all the while that the raging runagates and hellish



<P>Diabolonians were thus contriving the ruin of the town of



<P>Mansoul, they (namely, the poor town itself) was in a sad and



<P>woeful case; partly because they had so grievously offended



<P>Shaddai and his Son, and partly because that the enemies



<P>thereby got strength within them afresh; and also because,



<P>though they had by many petitions made suit to the Prince



<P>Emmanuel, and to his Father Shaddai by him, for their pardon



<P>and favour, yet hitherto obtained they not one smile; but



<P>contrariwise, through the craft and subtilty of the domestic



<P>Diabolonians, their cloud was made to grow blacker and



<P>blacker, and their Emmanuel to stand at further distance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sickness also did still greatly rage in Mansoul, both



<P>among the captains and the inhabitants of the town; and their



<P>enemies only were now lively and strong, and likely to become



<P>the head, whilst Mansoul was made the tail.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By this time the letter last mentioned, that was written by



<P>the Diabolonians that yet lurked in the town of Mansoul, was



<P>conveyed to Diabolus in the black den, by the hand of Mr.



<P>Profane.&nbsp; He carried the letter by Hell-Gate Hill as afore,



<P>and conveyed it by Cerberus to his lord.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But when Cerberus and Mr. Profane did meet, they were



<P>presently as great as beggars, and thus they fell into



<P>discourse about Mansoul, and about the project against her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Ah! old friend,' quoth Cerberus, 'art thou come to Hell-Gate



<P>Hill again?&nbsp; By St. Mary, I am glad to see thee!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PROF.&nbsp; Yes, my lord, I am come again about the concerns of



<P>the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CERB.&nbsp; Prithee, tell me what condition is that town of



<P>Mansoul in at present?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PROF.&nbsp; In a brave condition, my lord, for us, and for my



<P>lords, the lords of this place, I trow for they are greatly



<P>decayed as to godliness, and that is as well as our heart can



<P>wish; their Lord is greatly out with them, and that doth also



<P>please us well.&nbsp; We have already also a foot in their dish,



<P>for our Diabolonian friends are laid in their bosoms, and



<P>what do we lack but to be masters of the place!&nbsp; Besides, our



<P>trusty friends in Mansoul are daily plotting to betray it to



<P>the lords of this town; also the sickness rages bitterly



<P>among them; and that which makes up all, we hope at last to



<P>prevail.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the dog of Hell-Gate, 'No time like this to assault



<P>them.&nbsp; I wish that the enterprise be followed close, and that



<P>the success desired may be soon effected: yea, I wish it for



<P>the poor Diabolonians' sakes, that live in the continual fear



<P>of their lives in that traitorous town of Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PROF.&nbsp; The contrivance is almost finished, the lords in



<P>Mansoul that are Diabolonians are at it day and night, and



<P>the other are like silly doves; they want heart to be



<P>concerned with their state and to consider that ruin is at



<P>hand.&nbsp; Besides you may, yea, must think, when you put all



<P>things together, that there are many reasons that prevail



<P>with Diabolus to make what haste he can.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CERB.&nbsp; Thou hast said as it is; I am glad things are at this



<P>pass.&nbsp; Go in, my brave Profane, to my lords, they will give



<P>thee for thy welcome as good a CORANTO as the whole of this



<P>kingdom will afford.&nbsp; I have sent thy letter in already.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then Mr. Profane went into the den, and his lord Diabolus met



<P>him, and saluted him with, 'Welcome, my trusty servant: I



<P>have been made glad with thy letter.'&nbsp; The rest of the lords



<P>of the pit gave him also their salutations.&nbsp; Then Profane,



<P>after obeisance made to them all, said, 'Let Mansoul be given



<P>to my lord Diabolus, and let him be her king for ever.'&nbsp; And



<P>with that, the hollow belly and yawning gorge of hell gave so



<P>loud and hideous a groan, (for that is the music of that



<P>place,) that it made the mountains about it totter, as if



<P>they would fall in pieces.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, after they had read and considered the letter, they



<P>consulted what answer to return; and the first that did speak



<P>to it was Lucifer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said he, 'The first project of the Diabolonians in



<P>Mansoul is likely to be lucky, and to take; namely, that they



<P>will, by all the ways and means they can, make Mansoul yet



<P>more vile and filthy: no way to destroy a soul like this.



<P>Our old friend Balaam went this way and prospered many years



<P>ago; let this therefore stand with us for a maxim, and be to



<P>Diabolonians for a general rule in all ages; for nothing can



<P>make this to fail but grace, in which I would hope that this



<P>town has no share.&nbsp; But whether to fall upon them on a



<P>market-day, because of their cumber in business, that I would



<P>should be under debate.&nbsp; And there is more reason why this



<P>head should be debated, than why some other should; because



<P>upon this will turn the whole of what we shall attempt.&nbsp; If



<P>we time not our business well, our whole project may fail.



<P>Our friends, the Diabolonians, say that a market-day is best;



<P>for then will Mansoul be most busy, and have fewest thoughts



<P>of a surprise.&nbsp; But what if also they should double their



<P>guards on those days? (and methinks nature and reason should



<P>teach them to do it;) and what if they should keep such a



<P>watch on those days as the necessity of their present case



<P>doth require? yea, what if their men should be always in arms



<P>on those days? then you may, my lords, be disappointed in



<P>your attempts, and may bring our friends in the town to utter



<P>danger of unavoidable ruin.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the great Beelzebub, 'There is something in what my



<P>lord hath said; but his conjecture may, or may not fall out.



<P>Nor hath my lord laid it down as that which must not be



<P>receded from; for I know that he said it only to provoke to a



<P>warm debate thereabout.&nbsp; Therefore we must understand, if we



<P>can, whether the town of Mansoul has such sense and knowledge



<P>of her decayed state, and of the design that we have on foot



<P>against her, as doth provoke her to set watch and ward at her



<P>gates, and to double them on market-days.&nbsp; But if, after



<P>inquiry made, it shall be found that they are asleep, then



<P>any day will do, but a market-day is best; and this is my



<P>judgment in this case.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then quoth Diabolus, 'How should we know this?' and it was



<P>answered, 'Inquire about it at the mouth of Mr. Profane.'&nbsp; So



<P>Profane was called in, and asked the question, and he made



<P>his answer as follows:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PROF.&nbsp; My lords, so far as I can gather, this is at present



<P>the condition of the town of Mansoul: they are decayed in



<P>their faith and love; Emmanuel, their Prince, has given them



<P>the back; they send often by petition to fetch him again, but



<P>he maketh not haste to answer their request, nor is there



<P>much reformation among them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>DIAB.&nbsp; I am glad that they are backward in a reformation, but



<P>yet I am afraid of their petitioning.&nbsp; However, their



<P>looseness of life is a sign that there is not much heart in



<P>what they do, and without the heart things are little worth.



<P>But go on, my masters; I will divert you, my lords, no



<P>longer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>BEEL.&nbsp; If the case be so with Mansoul, as Mr. Profane has



<P>described it to be, it will be no great matter what day we



<P>assault it; not their prayers, nor their power will do them



<P>much service.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Beelzebub had ended his oration, then Apollyon did



<P>begin.&nbsp; 'My opinion,' said he, 'concerning this matter, is,



<P>that we go on fair and softly, not doing things in a hurry.



<P>Let our friends in Mansoul go on still to pollute and defile



<P>it, by seeking to draw it yet more into sin (for there is



<P>nothing like sin to devour Mansoul).&nbsp; If this be done, and it



<P>takes effect, Mansoul, of itself, will leave off to watch, to



<P>petition, or anything else that should tend to her security



<P>and safety; for she will forget her Emmanuel, she will not



<P>desire his company, and can she be gotten thus to live, her



<P>Prince will not come to her in haste.&nbsp; Our trusty friend, Mr.



<P>Carnal-Security, with one of his tricks did drive him out of



<P>the town; and why may not my Lord Covetousness, and my Lord



<P>Lasciviousness, by what they may do, keep him out of the



<P>town?&nbsp; And this I will tell you, (not because you know it



<P>not,) that two or three Diabolonians, if entertained and



<P>countenanced by the town of Mansoul, will do more to the



<P>keeping of Emmanuel from them, and towards making the town of



<P>Mansoul your own, than can an army of a legion that should be



<P>sent out from us to withstand him.&nbsp; Let, therefore, this



<P>first project that our friends in Mansoul have set on foot,



<P>be strongly and diligently carried on, with all cunning and



<P>craft imaginable; and let them send continually, under one



<P>guise or another, more and other of their men to play with



<P>the people of Mansoul; and then, perhaps, we shall not need



<P>to be at the charge of making a war upon them; or if that



<P>must of necessity be done, yet the more sinful they are, the



<P>more unable, to be sure, they will be to resist us, and then



<P>the more easily we shall overcome them.&nbsp; And besides, suppose



<P>(and that is the worst that can be supposed) that Emmanuel



<P>should come to them again, why may not the same means, or the



<P>like, drive him from them once more?&nbsp; Yea, why may he not, by



<P>their lapse into that sin again, be driven from them for



<P>ever, for the sake of which he was at the first driven from



<P>them for a season?&nbsp; And if this should happen, then away go



<P>with him his rams, his slings, his captains, his soldiers,



<P>and he leaveth Mansoul naked and bare.&nbsp; Yea, will not this



<P>town, when she sees herself utterly forsaken of her Prince,



<P>of her own accord open her gates again unto you, and make of



<P>you as in the days of old?&nbsp; But this must be done by time, a



<P>few days will not effect so great a work as this.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So soon as Apollyon had made an end of speaking, Diabolus



<P>began to blow out his own malice, and to plead his own cause;



<P>and he said, 'My lords, and powers of the cave, my true and



<P>trusty friends, I have with much impatience, as becomes me,



<P>given ear to your long and tedious orations.&nbsp; But my furious



<P>gorge, and empty paunch, so lusteth after a repossession of



<P>my famous town of Mansoul, that whatever comes out, I can



<P>wait no longer to see the events of lingering projects.&nbsp; I



<P>must, and that without further delay, seek, by all means I



<P>can, to fill my insatiable gulf with the soul and body of the



<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Therefore lend me your heads, your hearts,



<P>and your help, now I am going to recover my town of Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the lords and princes of the pit saw the flaming desire



<P>that was in Diabolus to devour the miserable town of Mansoul,



<P>they left off to raise any more objections, but consented to



<P>lend him what strength they could, though had Apollyon's



<P>advice been taken, they had far more fearfully distressed the



<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; But, I say, they were willing to lend him



<P>what strength they could, not knowing what need they might



<P>have of him, when they should engage for themselves, as he.



<P>Wherefore they fell to advising about the next thing



<P>propounded, namely, what soldiers they were, and also how



<P>many, with whom Diabolus should go against the town of



<P>Mansoul to take it; and after some debate, it was concluded,



<P>according as in the letter the Diabolonians had suggested,



<P>that none were more fit for that expedition than an army of



<P>terrible doubters.&nbsp; They therefore concluded to send against



<P>Mansoul an army of sturdy doubters.&nbsp; The number thought fit



<P>to be employed in that service was between twenty and thirty



<P>thousand.&nbsp; So then the result of that great council of those



<P>high and mighty lords was - That Diabolus should even now,



<P>out of hand, beat up his drum for men in the land of



<P>Doubting, which land lieth upon the confines of the place



<P>called Hell-Gate Hill, for men that might be employed by him



<P>against the miserable town of Mansoul.&nbsp; It was also



<P>concluded, that these lords themselves should help him in the



<P>war, and that they would to that end head and manage his men.



<P>So they drew up a letter, and sent back to the Diabolonians



<P>that lurked in Mansoul, and that waited for the back-coming



<P>of Mr. Profane, to signify to them into what method and



<P>forwardness they at present had put their design.&nbsp; The



<P>contents whereof now follow:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'From the dark and horrible dungeon of hell, Diabolus with



<P>all the society of the princes of darkness, sends to our



<P>trusty ones, in and about the walls of the town of Mansoul,



<P>now impatiently waiting for our most devilish answer to their



<P>venomous and most poisonous design against the town of



<P>Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Our native ones, in whom from day to day we boast, and in



<P>whose actions all the year long we do greatly delight



<P>ourselves, we received your welcome, because highly esteemed



<P>letter, at the hand of our trusty and greatly beloved, the



<P>old gentleman, Mr. Profane.&nbsp; And do give you to understand,



<P>that when we had broken it up, and had read the contents



<P>thereof, to your amazing memory be it spoken, our yawning



<P>hollow-bellied place, where we are, made so hideous and



<P>yelling a noise for joy, that the mountains that stand round



<P>about Hell-Gate Hill, had like to have been shaken to pieces



<P>at the sound thereof.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>'We could also do no less than admire your faithfulness to



<P>us, with the greatness of that subtilty that now hath showed



<P>itself to be in your heads to serve us against the town of



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; For you have invented for us so excellent a method



<P>for our proceeding against that rebellious people, a more



<P>effectual cannot be thought of by all the wits of hell.&nbsp; The



<P>proposals, therefore, which now, at last, you have sent us,



<P>since we saw them, we have done little else but highly



<P>approved and admired them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Nay, we shall, to encourage you in the profundity of your



<P>craft, let you know, that, at a full assembly and conclave of



<P>our princes and principalities of this place, your project



<P>was discoursed and tossed from one side of our cave to the



<P>other by their mightinesses; but a better, and as was by



<P>themselves judged, a more fit and proper way by all their



<P>wits, could not be invented, to surprise, take, and make our



<P>own, the rebellious town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Wherefore, in fine, all that was said that varied from what



<P>you had in your letter propounded, fell of itself to the



<P>ground, and yours only was stuck to by Diabolus, the prince;



<P>yea, his gaping gorge and yawning paunch was on fire to put



<P>your invention into execution.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'We therefore give you to understand that our stout, furious,



<P>and unmerciful Diabolus is raising, for your relief, and the



<P>ruin of the rebellious town of Mansoul, more than twenty



<P>thousand doubters to come against that people.&nbsp; They are all



<P>stout and sturdy men, and men that of old have been



<P>accustomed to war, and that can therefore well endure the



<P>drum.&nbsp; I say, he is doing this work of his with all the



<P>possible speed he can; for his heart and spirit is engaged in



<P>it.&nbsp; We desire, therefore, that, as you have hitherto stuck



<P>to us, and given us both advice and encouragement thus far,



<P>you still will prosecute our design; nor shall you lose, but



<P>be gainers thereby; yea, we intend to make you the lords of



<P>Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'One thing may not by any means be omitted, that is, those



<P>with us do desire that every one of you that are in Mansoul



<P>would still use all your power, cunning, and skill, with



<P>delusive persuasions, yet to draw the town of Mansoul into



<P>more sin and wickedness, even that sin may be finished and



<P>bring forth death.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'For thus it is concluded with us, that the more vile,



<P>sinful, and debauched the town of Mansoul is, more backward



<P>will be their Emmanuel to come to their help, either by



<P>presence or other relief; yea, the more sinful, the more



<P>weak, and so the more unable will they be to make resistance



<P>when we shall make our assault upon them to swallow them up.



<P>Yea, that may cause that their mighty Shaddai himself may



<P>cast them out of his protection; yea, and send for his



<P>captains and soldiers home, with his slings and rams, and



<P>leave them naked and bare; and then the town of Mansoul will



<P>of itself open to us, and fall as the fig into the mouth of



<P>the eater.&nbsp; Yea, to be sure. that we then with a great deal



<P>of ease shall come upon her and overcome her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'As to the time of our coming upon Mansoul, we, as yet, have



<P>not fully resolved upon that, though at present some of us



<P>think as you, that a market-day, or a market-day at night,



<P>will certainly be the best.&nbsp; However, do you be ready, and



<P>when you shall hear our roaring drum without, do you be as



<P>busy to make the most horrible confusion within.&nbsp; So shall



<P>Mansoul certainly be distressed before and behind, and shall



<P>not know which way to betake herself for help.&nbsp; My Lord



<P>Lucifer, my Lord Beelzebub, my Lord Apollyon, my Lord Legion,



<P>with the rest, salute you, as does also my Lord Diabolus; and



<P>we wish both you, with all that you do, or shall possess, the



<P>very self-same fruit and success for their doing as we



<P>ourselves at present enjoy for ours.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'From our dreadful confines in the most fearful pit, we



<P>salute you, and so do those many legions here with us,



<P>wishing you may be as hellishly prosperous as we desire to be



<P>ourselves.&nbsp; By the letter-carrier, Mr. Profane.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then Mr. Profane addressed himself for his return to Mansoul,



<P>with his errand from the horrible pit to the Diabolonians



<P>that dwelt in that town.&nbsp; So he came up the stairs from the



<P>deep to the mouth of the cave where Cerberus was.&nbsp; Now when



<P>Cerberus saw him, he asked how did matters go below, about



<P>and against the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PROF.&nbsp; Things go as well as we can expect.&nbsp; The letter that

I



<P>carried thither was highly approved, and well liked by all my



<P>lords, and I am returning to tell our Diabolonians so.&nbsp; I



<P>have an answer to it here in my bosom, that I am sure will



<P>make our masters that sent me glad; for the contents thereof



<P>are to encourage them to pursue their design to the utmost,



<P>and to be ready also to fall on within, when they shall see



<P>my Lord Diabolus beleaguering the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CERB.&nbsp; But does he intend to go against them himself?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PROF.&nbsp; Does he!&nbsp; Ay! and he will take along with him more



<P>than twenty thousand, all sturdy Doubters, and men of war,



<P>picked men from the land of Doubting, to serve him in the



<P>expedition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then was Cerberus glad, and said, 'And is there such brave



<P>preparations a-making to go against the miserable town of



<P>Mansoul?&nbsp; And would I might be put at the head of a thousand



<P>of them, that I might also show my valour against the famous



<P>town of Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PROF.&nbsp; Your wish may come to pass; you look like one that has



<P>mettle enough, and my lord will have with him those that are



<P>valiant and stout.&nbsp; But my business requires haste.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CERB.&nbsp; Ay, so it does.&nbsp; Speed thee to the town of Mansoul,



<P>with all the deepest mischiefs that this place can afford



<P>thee.&nbsp; And when thou shalt come to the house of Mr. Mischief,



<P>the place where the Diabolonians meet to plot, tell them that



<P>Cerberus doth wish them his service, and that if he may, he



<P>will with the army come up against the famous town of



<P>Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PROF.&nbsp; That I will.&nbsp; And I know that my lords that are there



<P>will be glad to hear it, and to see you also.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So after a few more such kind of compliments, Mr. Profane



<P>took his leave of his friend Cerberus; and Cerberus again,



<P>with a thousand of their pit-wishes, bid him haste, with all



<P>speed, to his masters.&nbsp; The which when he had heard, he made



<P>obeisance, and began to gather up his heels to run.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thus, therefore, he returned, and went and came to Mansoul;



<P>and going, as afore, to the house of Mr. Mischief, there he



<P>found the Diabolonians assembled, and waiting for his return.



<P>Now when he was come, and had presented himself, he also



<P>delivered to them his letter, and adjoined this compliment to



<P>them therewith: 'My lords, from the confines of the pit, the



<P>high and mighty principalities and powers of the den salute



<P>you here, the true Diabolonians of the town of Mansoul.



<P>Wishing you always the most proper of their benedictions, for



<P>the great service, high attempts, and brave achievements that



<P>you have put yourselves upon, for the restoring to our prince



<P>Diabolus the famous town of Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was therefore the present state of the miserable town of



<P>Mansoul: she had offended her Prince, and he was gone; she



<P>had encouraged the powers of hell, by her foolishness, to



<P>come against her to seek her utter destruction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>True, the town of Mansoul was somewhat made sensible of her



<P>sin, but the Diabolonians were gotten into her bowels; she



<P>cried, but Emmanuel was gone, and her cries did not fetch him



<P>as yet again.&nbsp; Besides, she knew not now whether, ever or



<P>never, he would return and come to his Mansoul again; nor did



<P>they know the power and industry of the enemy, nor how



<P>forward they were to put in execution that plot of hell that



<P>they had devised against her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They did, indeed, still send petition after petition to the



<P>Prince, but he answered all with silence.&nbsp; They did neglect



<P>reformation, and that was as Diabolus would have it; for he



<P>knew, if they regarded iniquity in their heart, their King



<P>would not hear their prayer; they therefore did still grow



<P>weaker and weaker, and were as a rolling thing before the



<P>whirlwind.&nbsp; They cried to their King for help, and laid



<P>Diabolonians in their bosoms: what therefore should a King do



<P>to them?&nbsp; Yea, there seemed now to be a mixture in Mansoul;



<P>the Diabolonians and the Mansoulians would walk the streets



<P>together.&nbsp; Yea, they began to seek their peace; for they



<P>thought that, since the sickness had been so mortal in



<P>Mansoul, it was in vain to go to handygripes with them.



<P>Besides, the weakness of Mansoul was the strength of their



<P>enemies; and the sins of Mansoul, the advantage of the



<P>Diabolonians.&nbsp; The foes of Mansoul did also now begin to



<P>promise themselves the town for a possession: there was no



<P>great difference now betwixt Mansoulians and Diabolonians:



<P>both seemed to be masters of Mansoul.&nbsp; Yea, the Diabolonians



<P>increased and grew, but the town of Mansoul diminished



<P>greatly.&nbsp; There were more than eleven thousand men, women,



<P>and children that died by the sickness in Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But now, as Shaddai would have it, there was one whose name



<P>was Mr. Prywell, a great lover of the people of Mansoul.&nbsp; And



<P>he, as his manner was, did go listening up and down in



<P>Mansoul to see, and to hear, if at any time he might, whether



<P>there was any design against it or no.&nbsp; For he was always a



<P>jealous man, and feared some mischief sometime would befal



<P>it, either from the Diabolonians within, or from some power



<P>without.&nbsp; Now upon a time it so happened, as Mr. Prywell went



<P>listening here and there, that he lighted upon a place called



<P>Vilehill, in Mansoul, where Diabolonians used to meet; so



<P>hearing a muttering, (you must know that it was in the



<P>night,) he softly drew near to hear; nor had he stood long



<P>under the house-end, (for there stood a house there,) but he



<P>heard one confidently affirm, that it was not, or would not



<P>be long before Diabolus should possess himself again of



<P>Mansoul; and that then the Diabolonians did intend to put all



<P>Mansoulians to the sword, and would kill and destroy the



<P>King's captains, and drive all his soldiers out of the town.



<P>He said, moreover, that he knew there were above twenty



<P>thousand fighting men prepared by Diabolus for the



<P>accomplishing of this design, and that it would not be months



<P>before they all should see it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Mr. Prywell had heard this story, he did quickly believe



<P>it was true: wherefore he went forthwith to my Lord Mayor's



<P>house, and acquainted him therewith; who, sending for the



<P>subordinate preacher, brake the business to him; and he as



<P>soon gave the alarm to the town; for he was now the chief



<P>preacher in Mansoul, because, as yet, my Lord Secretary was



<P>ill at ease.&nbsp; And this was the way that the subordinate



<P>preacher did take to alarm the town therewith.&nbsp; The same hour



<P>he caused the lecture bell to be rung; so the people came



<P>together: he gave them then a short exhortation to



<P>watchfulness, and made Mr. Prywell's news the argument



<P>thereof.&nbsp; 'For,' said he, 'an horrible plot is contrived



<P>against Mansoul, even to massacre us all in a day, nor is



<P>this story to be slighted; for Mr. Prywell is the author



<P>thereof.&nbsp; Mr. Prywell was always a lover of Mansoul, a sober



<P>and judicious man, a man that is no tattler, nor raiser of



<P>false reports, but one that loves to look into the very



<P>bottom of matters, and talks nothing of news, but by very



<P>solid arguments.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I will call him, and you shall hear him your own selves;' so



<P>he called him, and he came and told his tale so punctually,



<P>and affirmed its truth with such ample grounds, that Mansoul



<P>fell presently under a conviction of the truth of what he



<P>said.&nbsp; The preacher did also back him, saying, 'Sirs, it is



<P>not irrational for us to believe it, for we have provoked



<P>Shaddai to anger, and have sinned Emmanuel out of the town;



<P>we have had too much correspondence with Diabolonians, and



<P>have forsaken our former mercies: no marvel then, if the



<P>enemy both within and without should design and plot our



<P>ruin; and what time like this to do it?&nbsp; The sickness is now



<P>in the town, and we have been made weak thereby.&nbsp; Many a good



<P>meaning man is dead, and the Diabolonians of late grow



<P>stronger and stronger.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Besides,' quoth the subordinate preacher, 'I have received



<P>from this good truth-teller this one inkling further, that he



<P>understood by those that he overheard, that several letters



<P>have lately passed between the furies and the Diabolonians in



<P>order to our destruction.'&nbsp; When Mansoul heard all this, and



<P>not being able to gainsay it, they lift up their voice and



<P>wept.&nbsp; Mr. Prywell did also, in the presence of the townsmen,



<P>confirm all that their subordinate preacher had said.



<P>Wherefore they now set afresh to bewail their folly, and to a



<P>doubling of petitions to Shaddai and his Son.&nbsp; They also



<P>brake the business to the captains, high commanders, and men



<P>of war in the town of Mansoul, entreating them to use the



<P>means to be strong, and to take good courage; and that they



<P>would look after their harness, and make themselves ready to



<P>give Diabolus battle by night and by day, shall he come, as



<P>they are informed he will, to beleaguer the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the captains heard this, they being always true lovers



<P>of the town of Mansoul, what do they but like so many Samsons



<P>they shake themselves, and come together to consult and



<P>contrive how to defeat those bold and hellish contrivances



<P>that were upon the wheel by the means of Diabolus and his



<P>friends against the now sickly, weakly, and much impoverished



<P>town of Mansoul; and they agreed upon these following



<P>particulars:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1. That the gates of Mansoul should be kept shut, and made



<P>fast with bars and locks, and that all persons that went out,



<P>or came in, should be very strictly examined by the captains



<P>of the guards, 'to the end,' said they, 'that those that are



<P>managers of the plot amongst us, may, either coming or going,



<P>be taken; and that we may also find out who are the great



<P>contrivers, amongst us, of our ruin.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2. The next thing was, that a strict search should be made



<P>for all kind of Diabolonians throughout the whole town of



<P>Mansoul; and that every man's house from top to bottom should



<P>be looked into, and that, too, house by house, that if



<P>possible a further discovery might be made of all such among



<P>them as had a hand in these designs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3. It was further concluded upon, that wheresoever or with



<P>whomsoever any of the Diabolonians were found, that even



<P>those of the town of Mansoul that had given them house and



<P>harbour, should to their shame, and the warning of others,



<P>take penance in the open place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>4. It was, moreover, resolved by the famous town of Mansoul,



<P>that a public fast, and a day of humiliation, should be kept



<P>throughout the whole corporation, to the justifying of their



<P>Prince, the abasing of themselves before him for their



<P>transgressions against him, and against Shaddai, his Father.



<P>It was further resolved, that all such in Mansoul as did not



<P>on that day endeavour to keep that fast, and to humble



<P>themselves for their faults, but that should mind their



<P>worldly employs, or be found wandering up and down the



<P>streets, should be taken for Diabolonians, and should suffer



<P>as Diabolonians for such their wicked doings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>5. It was further concluded then, that with what speed, and



<P>with what warmth of mind they could, they would renew their



<P>humiliation for sin, and their petitions to Shaddai for help;



<P>they also resolved, to send tidings to the court of all that



<P>Mr. Prywell had told them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>6. It was also determined, that thanks should be given by the



<P>town of Mansoul to Mr. Prywell, for his diligent seeking of



<P>the welfare of their town: and further, that forasmuch as he



<P>was so naturally inclined to seek their good, and also to



<P>undermine their foes, they gave him a commission of scout-



<P>master-general, for the good of the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the corporation, with their captains, had thus



<P>concluded, they did as they had said; they shut up their



<P>gates, they made for Diabolonians strict search, they made



<P>those with whom any were found to take penance in the open



<P>place: they kept their fast, and renewed their petitions to



<P>their Prince, and Mr. Prywell managed his charge and the



<P>trust that Mansoul had put in his hands, with great



<P>conscience and good fidelity; for he gave himself wholly up



<P>to his employ, and that not only within the town, but he went



<P>out to pry, to see, and to hear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And not many days after he provided for his journey, and went



<P>towards Hell-Gate Hill, into the country where the Doubters



<P>were, where he heard of all that had been talked of in



<P>Mansoul, and he perceived also that Diabolus was almost ready



<P>for his march, etc.&nbsp; So he came back with speed, and, calling



<P>the captains and elders of Mansoul together, he told them



<P>where he had been, what he had heard, and what he had seen.



<P>Particularly, he told them that Diabolus was almost ready for



<P>his march, and that he had made old Mr. Incredulity, that



<P>once brake prison in Mansoul, the, general of his army; that



<P>his army consisted all of Doubters, and that their number was



<P>above twenty thousand.&nbsp; He told, moreover, that Diabolus did



<P>intend to bring with him the chief princes of the infernal



<P>pit, and that he would make them chief captains over his



<P>Doubters.&nbsp; He told them, moreover, that it was certainly true



<P>that several of the black den would, with Diabolus, ride



<P>reformades to reduce the town of Mansoul to the obedience of



<P>Diabolus, their prince.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He said, moreover, that he understood by the Doubters, among



<P>whom he had been, that the reason why old Incredulity was



<P>made general of the whole army, was because none truer than



<P>he to the tyrant; and because he had an implacable spite



<P>against the welfare of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Besides, said



<P>he, he remembers the affronts that Mansoul has given him, and



<P>he is resolved to be revenged of them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the black princes shall be made high commanders, only



<P>Incredulity shall be over them all; because, which I had



<P>almost forgot, he can more easily, and more dexterously,



<P>beleaguer the town of Mansoul, than can any of the princes



<P>besides.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when the captains of Mansoul, with the elders of the



<P>town, had heard the tidings that Mr. Prywell did bring, they



<P>thought it expedient, without further delay, to put into



<P>execution the laws that against the Diabolonians their Prince



<P>had made for them, and given them in commandment to manage



<P>against them.&nbsp; Wherefore, forthwith a diligent and impartial



<P>search was made in all houses in Mansoul, for all and all



<P>manner of Diabolonians.&nbsp; Now, in the house of Mr. Mind, and



<P>in the house of the great Lord Willbewill, were two



<P>Diabolonians found.&nbsp; In Mr. Mind's house was one Lord



<P>Covetousness found; but he had changed his name to Prudent-



<P>Thrifty.&nbsp; In my Lord Willbewill's house, one Lasciviousness



<P>was found; but he had changed his name to Harmless-Mirth.



<P>These two the captains and elders of the town of Mansoul



<P>took, and committed them to custody under the hand of Mr.



<P>Trueman, the gaoler; and this man handled them so severely,



<P>and loaded them so well with irons, that in time they both



<P>fell into a very deep consumption, and died in the prison-



<P>house; their masters also, according to the agreement of the



<P>captains and elders, were brought to take penance in the open



<P>place to their shame, and for a warning to the rest of the



<P>town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, this was the manner of penance in those days: the



<P>persons offending being made sensible of the evil of their



<P>doings, were enjoined open confession of their faults, and a



<P>strict amendment of their lives.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After this, the captains and elders of Mansoul sought yet to



<P>find out more Diabolonians, wherever they lurked, whether in



<P>dens, caves, holes, vaults, or where else they could, in or



<P>about the wall or town of Mansoul.&nbsp; But though they could



<P>plainly see their footing, and so follow them by their track



<P>and smell to their holds, even to the mouths of their caves



<P>and dens, yet take them, hold them, and do justice upon them,



<P>they could not; their ways were so crooked, their holds so



<P>strong, and they so quick to take sanctuary there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Mansoul did now with so stiff an hand rule over the



<P>Diabolonians that were left, that they were glad to shrink



<P>into corners: time was when they durst walk openly, and in



<P>the day; but now they were forced to embrace privacy and the



<P>night: time was when a Mansoulian was their companion; but



<P>now they counted them deadly enemies.&nbsp; This good change did



<P>Mr. Prywell's intelligence make in the famous town of



<P>Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By this time, Diabolus had finished his army which he



<P>intended to bring with him for the ruin of Mansoul; and had



<P>set over them captains, and other field officers, such as



<P>liked his furious stomach best: himself was lord paramount,



<P>Incredulity was general of his army, their highest captains



<P>shall be named afterwards; but now for their officers,



<P>colours, and scutcheons.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1. Their first captain was Captain Rage: he was captain over



<P>the election doubters, his were the red colours; his



<P>standard-bearer was Mr. Destructive, and the great red dragon



<P>he had for his scutcheon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2. The second captain was Captain Fury: he was captain over



<P>the vocation doubters; his standard-bearer was Mr. Darkness,



<P>his colours were those that were pale, and he had for his



<P>scutcheon the fiery flying serpent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3. The third captain was Captain Damnation: he was captain



<P>over the grace doubters; his were the red colours, Mr. No-



<P>Life bare them, and he had for his scutcheon the black den.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>4. The fourth captain was Captain Insatiable; he was captain



<P>over the faith doubters: his were the red colours, Mr.



<P>Devourer bare them, and he had for a scutcheon the yawning



<P>jaws.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>5. The fifth captain was Captain Brimstone: he was captain



<P>over the perseverance doubters; his also were the red



<P>colours, Mr. Burning bare them, and his scutcheon was the



<P>blue and stinking flame.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>6. The sixth captain was Captain Torment: he was captain over



<P>the resurrection doubters; his colours were those that were



<P>pale; Mr. Gnaw was his standard-bearer, and he had the black



<P>worm for his scutcheon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>7. The seventh captain was Captain No-Ease; he was captain



<P>over the salvation doubters; his were the red colours, Mr.



<P>Restless bare them, and his scutcheon was the ghastly picture



<P>of death.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>8. The eighth captain was the Captain Sepulchre: he was



<P>captain over the glory doubters; his also were the pale



<P>colours, Mr. Corruption was his standard-bearer, and he had



<P>for his scutcheon a skull, and dead men's bones.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>9. The ninth captain was Captain Past-Hope; he was captain of



<P>those that are called the felicity doubters; his standard-



<P>bearer was Mr. Despair; his also were the red colours, and



<P>his scutcheon was a hot iron and the hard heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These were his captains, and these were their forces, these



<P>were their standards, these were their colours, and these



<P>were their scutcheons.&nbsp; Now, over these did the great



<P>Diabolus make superior captains, and they were in number



<P>seven: as, namely, the Lord Beelzebub, the Lord Lucifer, the



<P>Lord Legion, the Lord Apollyon, the Lord Python, the Lord



<P>Cerberus, and the Lord Belial; these seven he set over the



<P>captains, and Incredulity was lord-general, and, Diabolus was



<P>king.&nbsp; The reformades also, such as were like themselves,



<P>were made some of them captains of hundreds, and some of them



<P>captains of more.&nbsp; And thus was the army of Incredulity



<P>completed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So they set out at Hell-Gate Hill, for there they had their



<P>rendezvous, from whence they came with a straight course upon



<P>their march toward the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Now, as was hinted



<P>before, the town had, as Shaddai would have it, received from



<P>the mouth of Mr. Prywell the alarm of their coming before.



<P>Wherefore they set a strong watch at the gates, and had also



<P>doubled their guards: they also mounted their slings in good



<P>places, where they might conveniently cast out their great



<P>stones to the annoyance of their furious enemy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nor could those Diabolonians that were in the town do that



<P>hurt as was designed they should; for Mansoul was now awake.



<P>But alas! poor people, they were sorely affrighted at the



<P>first appearance of their foes, and at their sitting down



<P>before the town, especially when they heard the roaring of



<P>their drum.&nbsp; This, to speak truth, was amazingly hideous to



<P>hear; it frighted all men seven miles round, if they were but



<P>awake and heard it.&nbsp; The streaming of their colours was also



<P>terrible and dejecting to behold.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Diabolus was come up against the town, first he made his



<P>approach to Ear-gate, and gave it a furious assault,



<P>supposing, as it seems, that his friends in Mansoul had been



<P>ready to do the work within; but care was taken of that



<P>before, by the vigilance of the captains.&nbsp; Wherefore, missing



<P>of the help that he expected from them, and finding his army



<P>warmly attended with the stones that the slingers did sling,



<P>(for that I will say for the captains, that considering the



<P>weakness that yet was upon them by reason of the long



<P>sickness that had annoyed the town of Mansoul, they did



<P>gallantly behave themselves,) he was forced to make some



<P>retreat from Mansoul, and to entrench himself and his men in



<P>the field without the reach of the slings of the town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now having entrenched himself, he did cast up four mounts



<P>against the town: the first he called Mount Diabolus, putting



<P>his own name thereon, the more to affright the town of



<P>Mansoul; the other three he called thus - Mount Alecto, Mount



<P>Megara, and Mount Tisiphone; for these are the names of the



<P>dreadful furies of hell.&nbsp; Thus he began to play his game with



<P>Mansoul, and to serve it as doth the lion his prey, even to



<P>make it fall before his terror.&nbsp; But, as I said, the captains



<P>and soldiers resisted so stoutly, and did do such execution



<P>with their stones, that they made him, though against



<P>stomach, to retreat, wherefore Mansoul began to take courage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now upon Mount Diabolus, which was raised on the north side



<P>of the town, there did the tyrant set up his standard, and a



<P>fearful thing it was to behold; for he had wrought in it by



<P>devilish art, after the manner of a scutcheon, a flaming



<P>flame fearful to behold, and the picture of Mansoul burning



<P>in it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Diabolus had thus done, he commanded that his drummer



<P>should every night approach the walls of the town of Mansoul,



<P>and so to beat a parley; the command was to do it at nights,



<P>for in the daytime they annoyed him with their slings; for



<P>the tyrant said, that he had a mind to parley with the now



<P>trembling town of Mansoul, and he commanded that the drums



<P>should beat every night, that through weariness they might at



<P>last, if possible, (at the first they were unwilling yet,) be



<P>forced to do it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So this drummer did as commanded: he arose, and did beat his



<P>drum.&nbsp; But when his drum did go, if one looked toward the



<P>town of Mansoul, 'Behold darkness and sorrow, and the light



<P>was darkened in the heaven thereof.'&nbsp; No noise was ever heard



<P>upon earth more terrible, except the voice of Shaddai when he



<P>speaketh.&nbsp; But how did Mansoul tremble! it now looked for



<P>nothing but forthwith to be swallowed up.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When this drummer had beaten for a parley, he made this



<P>speech to Mansoul: 'My master has bid me tell you, that if



<P>you will willingly submit, you shall have the good of the



<P>earth; but if you shall be stubborn, he is resolved to take



<P>you by force.'&nbsp; But by that the fugitive had done beating his



<P>drum, the people of Mansoul had betaken themselves to the



<P>captains that were in the castle, so that there was none to



<P>regard, nor to give this drummer an answer; so he proceeded



<P>no further that night, but returned again to his master to



<P>the camp.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Diabolus saw that by drumming he could not work out



<P>Mansoul to his will, the next night he sendeth his drummer



<P>without his drum, still to let the townsmen know that he had



<P>a mind to parley with them.&nbsp; But when all came to all, his



<P>parley was turned into a summons to the town to deliver up



<P>themselves: but they gave him neither heed nor hearing: for



<P>they remembered what at first it cost them to hear him a few



<P>words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The next night he sends again, and then who should be his



<P>messenger to Mansoul but the terrible Captain Sepulchre; so



<P>Captain Sepulchre came up to the walls of Mansoul, and made



<P>this oration to the town:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'O ye inhabitants of the rebellious town of Mansoul!&nbsp; I



<P>summon you in the name of the Prince Diabolus, that, without



<P>any more ado, you set open the gates of your town, and admit



<P>the great lord to come in.&nbsp; But if you shall still rebel,



<P>when we have taken to us the town by force, we will swallow



<P>you up as the grave; wherefore if you will hearken to my



<P>summons, say so, and if not then let me know.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'The reason of this my summons,' quoth he, 'is, for that my



<P>lord is your undoubted prince and lord, as you yourselves



<P>have formerly owned.&nbsp; Nor shall that assault that was given



<P>to my lord, when Emmanuel dealt so dishonourably by him,



<P>prevail with him to lose his right, and to forbear to attempt



<P>to recover his own.&nbsp; Consider, then, O Mansoul, with thyself,



<P>wilt thou show thyself peaceable, or no?&nbsp; If thou shalt



<P>quietly yield up thyself, then our old friendship shall be



<P>renewed; but if thou shalt yet refuse and rebel, then expect



<P>nothing but fire and sword.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the languishing town of Mansoul had heard this summoner



<P>and his summons, they were yet more put to their dumps, but



<P>made to the captain no answer at all; so away he went as he



<P>came.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But, after some consultation among themselves, as also with



<P>some of their captains, they applied themselves afresh to the



<P>Lord Secretary for counsel and advice from him; for this Lord



<P>Secretary was their chief preacher, (as also is mentioned



<P>some pages before,) only now he was ill at ease; and of him



<P>they begged favour in these two or three things -

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1. That he would look comfortably upon them, and not keep



<P>himself so much retired from them as formerly.&nbsp; Also, that he



<P>would be prevailed with to give them a hearing, while they



<P>should make known their miserable condition to him.&nbsp; But to



<P>this he told them as before, that 'as yet he was but ill at



<P>ease, and therefore could not do as he had formerly done.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2. The second thing that they desired was, that he would be



<P>pleased to give them his advice about their now so important



<P>affairs, for that Diabolus was come and set down before the



<P>town with no less than twenty thousand doubters.&nbsp; They said,



<P>moreover, that both he and his captains were cruel men, and



<P>that they were afraid of them.&nbsp; But to this he said, 'You



<P>must look to the law of the Prince, and there see what is



<P>laid upon you to do.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3. Then they desired that his highness would help them to



<P>frame a petition to Shaddai, and unto Emmanuel his Son, and



<P>that he would set his own hand thereto as a token that he was



<P>one with them in it: 'For,' said they, 'my Lord, many a one



<P>have we sent, but can get no answer of peace; but now,



<P>surely, one with thy hand unto it may obtain good for



<P>Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But all the answer that he gave to this was, 'that they had



<P>offended their Emmanuel, and had also grieved himself, and



<P>that therefore they must as yet partake of their own



<P>devices.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This answer of the Lord Secretary fell like a millstone upon



<P>them; yea, it crushed them so that they could not tell what



<P>to do; yet they durst not comply with the demands of



<P>Diabolus, nor with the demands of his captain.&nbsp; So then here



<P>were the straits that the town of Mansoul was betwixt, when



<P>the enemy came upon her: her foes were ready to swallow her



<P>up, and her friends did forbear to help her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then stood up my Lord Mayor, whose name was my Lord



<P>Understanding, and he began to pick and pick, until he had



<P>picked comfort out of that seemingly bitter saying of the



<P>Lord Secretary; for thus he descanted upon it: 'First,' said



<P>he, 'this unavoidably follows upon the saying of my Lord,



<P>"that we must yet suffer for our sins."&nbsp; Secondly, But,'



<P>quoth he, 'the words yet sound as if at last we should be



<P>saved from our enemies, and that after a few more sorrows,



<P>Emmanuel will come and be our help.'&nbsp; Now the Lord Mayor was



<P>the more critical in his dealing with the Secretary's words,



<P>because my lord was more than a prophet, and because none of



<P>his words were such, but that at all times they were most



<P>exactly significant; and the townsmen were allowed to pry



<P>into them, and to expound them to their best advantage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So they took their leaves of my lord, and returned, and went,



<P>and came to the captains, to whom they did tell what my Lord



<P>High Secretary had said; who, when they had heard it, were



<P>all of the same opinion as was my Lord Mayor himself.&nbsp; The



<P>captains, therefore, began to take some courage unto them,



<P>and to prepare to make some brave attempt upon the camp of



<P>the enemy, and to destroy all that were Diabolonians, with



<P>the roving doubters that the tyrant had brought with him to



<P>destroy the poor town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So all betook themselves forthwith to their places - the



<P>Captains to theirs, the Lord Mayor to his, the subordinate



<P>preacher to his, and my Lord Willbewill to his.&nbsp; The captains



<P>longed to be at some work for their prince; for they



<P>delighted in warlike achievements.&nbsp; The next day, therefore,



<P>they came together and consulted; and after consultation had,



<P>they resolved to give an answer to the captain of Diabolus



<P>with slings; and so they did at the rising of the sun on the



<P>morrow; for Diabolus had adventured to come nearer again, but



<P>the sling-stones were to him and his like hornets.&nbsp; For as



<P>there is nothing to the town of Mansoul so terrible as the



<P>roaring of Diabolus's drum, so there is nothing to Diabolus



<P>so terrible as the well playing of Emmanuel's slings.



<P>Wherefore Diabolus was forced to make another retreat, yet



<P>further off from the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Then did the



<P>Lord Mayor of Mansoul cause the bells to be rung, 'and that



<P>thanks should be sent to the Lord High Secretary by the mouth



<P>of the subordinate preacher; for that by his words the



<P>captains and elders of Mansoul had been strengthened against



<P>Diabolus.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Diabolus saw that his captains and soldiers, high lords



<P>and renowned, were frightened, and beaten down by the stones



<P>that came from the golden slings of the Prince of the town of



<P>Mansoul, he bethought himself, and said, 'I will try to catch



<P>them by fawning, I will try to flatter them into my net.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wherefore, after a while, he came down again to the wall, not



<P>now with his drum, nor with Captain Sepulchre; but having all



<P>besugared his lips, he seemed to be a very sweet-mouthed,



<P>peaceable prince, designing nothing for humour's sake, nor to



<P>be revenged on Mansoul for injuries by them done to him; but



<P>the welfare, and good, and advantage of the town and people



<P>therein was now, as he said, his only design.&nbsp; Wherefore,



<P>after he had called for audience, and desired that the



<P>townsfolk would give it to him, he proceeded in his oration,



<P>and said:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, the desire of my heart, the famous town of Mansoul! how



<P>many nights have I watched, and how many weary steps have I



<P>taken, if perhaps I might do thee good!&nbsp; Far be it, far be it



<P>from me to desire to make a war upon you; if ye will but



<P>willingly and quietly deliver up yourselves unto me.&nbsp; You



<P>know that you were mine of old.&nbsp; Remember also, that so long



<P>as you enjoyed me for your lord, and that I enjoyed you for



<P>my subjects, you wanted for nothing of all the delights of



<P>the earth, that I, your lord and prince, could get for you,



<P>or that I could invent to make you bonny and blithe withal.



<P>Consider, you never had so many hard, dark, troublesome, and



<P>heart-afflicting hours, while you were mine, as you have had



<P>since you revolted from me; nor shall you ever have peace



<P>again, until you and I become one as before.&nbsp; But, be but



<P>prevailed with to embrace me again, and I will grant, yea,



<P>enlarge your old charter with abundance of privileges; so



<P>that your license and liberty shall be to take, hold, enjoy,



<P>and make your own all that is pleasant from the east to the



<P>west.&nbsp; Nor shall any of those incivilities, wherewith you



<P>have offended me, be ever charged upon you by me, so long as



<P>the sun and moon endure.&nbsp; Nor shall any of those dear friends



<P>of mine that now, for the fear of you, lie lurking in dens,



<P>and holes, and caves in Mansoul, be hurtful to you any more;



<P>yea, they shall be your servants, and shall minister unto you



<P>of their substance, and of whatever shall come to hand.&nbsp; I



<P>need speak no more; you know them, and have sometime since



<P>been much delighted in their company.&nbsp; Why, then, should we



<P>abide at such odds?&nbsp; Let us renew our old acquaintance and



<P>friendship again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Bear with your friend; I take the liberty at this time to



<P>speak thus freely unto you.&nbsp; The love that I have to you



<P>presses me to do it, as also does the zeal of my heart for my



<P>friends with you: put me not therefore to further trouble,



<P>nor yourselves to further fears and frights.&nbsp; Have you I



<P>will, in a way of peace or war; nor do you flatter yourselves



<P>with the power and force of your captains, or that your



<P>Emmanuel will shortly come in to your help; for such strength



<P>will do you no pleasure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I am come against you with a stout and valiant army, and all



<P>the chief princes of the den are even at the head of it.



<P>Besides, my captains are swifter than eagles, stronger than



<P>lions, and more greedy of prey than are the evening wolves.



<P>What is Og of Bashan! what is Goliath of Gath! and what are



<P>an hundred more of them, to one of the least of my captains!



<P>How, then, shall Mansoul think to escape my hand and force?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Diabolus having thus handed his flattering, fawning,



<P>deceitful, and lying speech to the famous town of Mansoul,



<P>the Lord Mayor replied to him as follows: 'O Diabolus, prince



<P>of darkness, and master of all deceit; thy lying flatteries



<P>we have had and made sufficient probation of, and have tasted



<P>too deeply of that destructive cup already.&nbsp; Should we



<P>therefore again hearken unto thee, and so break the



<P>commandments of our great Shaddai, to join in affinity with



<P>thee, would not our Prince reject us, and cast us off for



<P>ever?&nbsp; And, being cast off by him, can the place that he has



<P>prepared for thee be a place of rest for us?&nbsp; Besides, O thou



<P>that art empty and void of all truth, we are rather ready to



<P>die by thy hand, than to fall in with thy flattering and



<P>lying deceits.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the tyrant saw that there was little to be got by



<P>parleying with my Lord Mayor, he fell into an hellish rage,



<P>and resolved that again, with his army of doubters, he would



<P>another time assault the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So he called for his drummer, who beat up for his men (and



<P>while he did beat, Mansoul did shake) to be in a readiness to



<P>give battle to the corporation: then Diabolus drew near with



<P>his army, and thus disposed of his men.&nbsp; Captain Cruel and



<P>Captain Torment, these he drew up and placed against Feel-



<P>gate, and commanded them to sit down there for the war.&nbsp; And



<P>he also appointed that, if need were, Captain No-Ease should



<P>come in to their relief.&nbsp; At Nose-gate he placed the Captain



<P>Brimstone and Captain Sepulchre, and bid them look well to



<P>their ward, on that side of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; But at Eye-



<P>gate he placed that grim-faced one, the Captain Past-Hope,



<P>and there also now he did set up his terrible standard.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now Captain Insatiable, he was to look to the carriages of



<P>Diabolus, and was also appointed to take into custody that,



<P>or those persons and things, that should at any time as prey



<P>be taken from the enemy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now Mouth-gate the inhabitants of Mansoul kept for a sally-



<P>port; wherefore that they kept strong; for that it was it by



<P>and out at which the townsfolk did send their petitions to



<P>Emmanuel their Prince.&nbsp; That also was the gate from the top



<P>of which the captains did play their slings at the enemies;



<P>for that gate stood somewhat ascending, so that the placing



<P>of them there, and the letting of them fly from that place,



<P>did much execution against the tyrant's army.&nbsp; Wherefore, for



<P>these causes, with others, Diabolus sought, if possible, to



<P>land up Mouth-gate with dirt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, as Diabolus was busy and industrious in preparing to



<P>make his assault upon the town of Mansoul, without, so the



<P>captains and soldiers in the corporation were as busy in



<P>preparing within; they mounted their slings, they set up



<P>their banners, they sounded their trumpets, and put



<P>themselves in such order as was judged most for the annoyance



<P>of the enemy, and for the advantage of Mansoul, and gave to



<P>their soldiers orders to be ready at the sound of the trumpet



<P>for war.&nbsp; The Lord Willbewill also, he took the charge of



<P>watching against the rebels within, and to do what he could



<P>to take them while without, or to stifle them within their



<P>caves, dens, and holes in the town-wall of Mansoul.&nbsp; And, to



<P>speak the truth of him, ever since he took penance for his



<P>fault, he has showed as much honesty and bravery of spirit as



<P>any he in Mansoul; for he took one Jolly, and his brother



<P>Griggish, the two sons of his servant Harmless-Mirth, (for to



<P>that day, though the father was committed to ward, the sons



<P>had a dwelling in the house of my lord,) - I say, he took



<P>them, and with his own hands put them to the cross.&nbsp; And this



<P>was the reason why he hanged them up: after their father was



<P>put into the hands of Mr. True-Man the gaoler, they, his



<P>sons, began to play his pranks, and to be ticking and toying



<P>with the daughters of their lord; nay, it was jealoused that



<P>they were too familiar with them, the which was brought to



<P>his lordship's ear.&nbsp; Now his lordship being unwilling



<P>unadvisedly to put any man to death, did not suddenly fall



<P>upon them, but set watch and spies to see if the thing was



<P>true; of the which he was soon informed, for his two



<P>servants, whose names were Find-Out and Tell-All, catched



<P>them together in uncivil manner more than once or twice, and



<P>went and told their lord.&nbsp; So when my Lord Willbewill had



<P>sufficient ground to believe the thing was true, he takes the



<P>two young Diabolonians, (for such they were, for their father



<P>was a Diabolonian born,) and has them to Eye-gate, where he



<P>raised a very high cross, just in the face of Diabolus, and



<P>of his army, and there he hanged the young villains, in



<P>defiance to Captain Past-Hope, and of the horrible standard



<P>of the tyrant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now this Christian act of the brave Lord Willbewill did



<P>greatly abash Captain Past-Hope, discouraged the army of



<P>Diabolus, put fear into the Diabolonian runagates in Mansoul,



<P>and put strength and courage into the captains that belonged



<P>to Emmanuel, the Prince; for they without did gather, and



<P>that by this very act of my Lord, that Mansoul was resolved



<P>to fight, and that the Diabolonians within the town could not



<P>do such things as Diabolus had hopes they would.&nbsp; Nor was



<P>this the only proof of the brave Lord Willbewill's honesty to



<P>the town, nor of his loyalty to his Prince, as will



<P>afterwards appear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when the children of Prudent-Thrifty, who dwelt with Mr.



<P>Mind, (for Thrift left children with Mr. Mind, when he was



<P>also committed to prison, and their names were Gripe and



<P>Rake-All; these he begat of Mr. Mind's bastard daughter,



<P>whose name was Mrs. Hold-fast-Bad;) - I say, when his



<P>children perceived how the Lord Willbewill had served them



<P>that dwelt with him, what do they but, lest they should drink



<P>of the same cup, endeavour to make their escape.&nbsp; But Mr.



<P>Mind, being wary of it, took them and put them in hold in his



<P>house till morning; (for this was done over night;) and



<P>remembering that by the law of Mansoul all Diabolonians were



<P>to die, (and to be sure they were at least by father's side



<P>such, and some say by mother's side too,) what does he but



<P>takes them and puts them in chains, and carries them to the



<P>selfsame place where my lord hanged his two before, and there



<P>he hanged them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The townsmen also took great encouragement at this act of Mr.



<P>Mind, and did what they could to have taken some more of



<P>these Diabolonian troublers of Mansoul; but at that time the



<P>rest lay so squat and close, that they could not be



<P>apprehended; so they set against them a diligent watch, and



<P>went every man to his place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I told you a little before, that Diabolus and his army were



<P>somewhat abashed and discouraged at the sight of what my Lord



<P>Willbewill did, when he hanged up those two young



<P>Diabolonians; but his discouragement quickly turned itself



<P>into furious madness and rage against the town of Mansoul,



<P>and fight it he would.&nbsp; Also the townsmen and captains



<P>within, they had their hopes and their expectations



<P>heightened, believing at last the day would be theirs; so



<P>they feared them the less.&nbsp; Their subordinate preacher, too,



<P>made a sermon about it; and he took that theme for his text,



<P>'Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at



<P>the last.'&nbsp; Whence he showed, that though Mansoul should be



<P>sorely put to it at the first, yet the victory should most



<P>certainly be Mansoul's at the last.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So Diabolus commanded that his drummer should beat a charge



<P>against the town; and the captains also that were in the town



<P>sounded a charge against them, but they had no drum: they



<P>were trumpets of silver with which they sounded against them.



<P>Then they which were of the camp of Diabolus came down to the



<P>town to take it, and the captains in the castle, with the



<P>slingers at Mouth-gate, played upon them amain.&nbsp; And now



<P>there was nothing heard in the camp of Diabolus but horrible



<P>rage and blasphemy; but in the town good words, prayer, and



<P>singing of psalms.&nbsp; The enemy replied with horrible



<P>objections, and the terribleness of their drum; but the town



<P>made answer with the slapping of their slings, and the



<P>melodious noise of their trumpets.&nbsp; And thus the fight lasted



<P>for several days together, only now and then they had some



<P>small intermission, in the which the townsmen refreshed



<P>themselves, and the captains made ready for another assault.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The captains of Emmanuel were clad in silver armour, and the



<P>soldiers in that which was of proof; the soldiers of Diabolus



<P>were clad in iron which was made to give place to Emmanuel's



<P>engine-shot.&nbsp; In the town, some were hurt, and some were



<P>greatly wounded.&nbsp; Now, the worst of it was, a chirurgeon was



<P>scarce in Mansoul, for that Emmanuel at present was absent.



<P>Howbeit, with the leaves of a tree the wounded were kept from



<P>dying; yet their wounds did greatly putrefy, and some did



<P>grievously stink.&nbsp; Of the townsmen, these were wounded,



<P>namely, my Lord Reason; he was wounded in the head.&nbsp; Another



<P>that was wounded was the brave Lord Mayor; he was wounded in



<P>the eye.&nbsp; Another that was wounded was Mr. Mind; he received



<P>his wound about the stomach.&nbsp; The honest subordinate preacher



<P>also, he received a shot not far off the heart but none of



<P>these were mortal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Many also of the inferior sort were not only wounded but



<P>slain outright.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, in the camp of Diabolus were wounded and slain a



<P>considerable number; for instance, Captain Rage, he was



<P>wounded, and so was Captain Cruel.&nbsp; Captain Damnation was



<P>made to retreat, and to intrench himself further off of



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; The standard also of Diabolus was beaten down, and



<P>his standard-bearer, Captain Much-Hurt, had his brains beat



<P>out with a sling-stone, to the no little grief and shame of



<P>his prince Diabolus.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Many also of the doubters were slain outright, though enough



<P>of them were left alive to make Mansoul shake and totter.



<P>Now the victory that day being turned to Mansoul, did put



<P>great valour into the townsmen and captains, and did cover



<P>Diabolus's camp with a cloud, but withal it made them far



<P>more furious.&nbsp; So the next day Mansoul rested, and commanded



<P>that the bells should be rung; the trumpets also joyfully



<P>sounded, and the captains shouted round the town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My Lord Willbewill also was not idle, but did notable service



<P>within against the domestics, or the Diabolonians that were



<P>in the town, not only by keeping them in awe, for he lighted



<P>on one at last whose name was Mr. Anything, a fellow of whom



<P>mention was made before; for it was he, if you remember, that



<P>brought the three fellows to Diabolus, whom the Diabolonians



<P>took out of Captain Boanerges's companies, and that persuaded



<P>them to list themselves under the tyrant, to fight against



<P>the army of Shaddai.&nbsp; My Lord Willbewill did also take a



<P>notable Diabolonian, whose name was Loose-Foot: this Loose-



<P>Foot was a scout to the vagabonds in Mansoul, and that did



<P>use to carry tidings out of Mansoul to the camp, and out of



<P>the camp to those of the enemies in Mansoul.&nbsp; Both these my



<P>lord sent away safe to Mr. True-Man, the gaoler, with a



<P>commandment to keep them in irons; for he intended then to



<P>have them out to be crucified, when it would be for the best



<P>to the corporation, and most for the discouragement of the



<P>camp of the enemies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My Lord Mayor also, though he could not stir about so much as



<P>formerly, because of the wound that he lately received, yet



<P>gave he out orders to all that were the natives of Mansoul,



<P>to look to their watch, and stand upon their guard, and, as



<P>occasion should offer, to prove themselves men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Conscience, the preacher, he also did his utmost to keep



<P>all his good documents alive upon the hearts of the people of



<P>Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, awhile after, the captains and stout ones of the town



<P>of Mansoul agreed and resolved upon a time to make a sally



<P>out upon the camp of Diabolus, and this must be done in the



<P>night; and there was the folly of Mansoul, (for the night is



<P>always the best for the enemy, but the worst for Mansoul to



<P>fight in,) but yet they would do it, their courage was so



<P>high; their last victory also still stuck in their memories.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So the night appointed being come, the Prince's brave



<P>captains cast lots who should lead the van in this new and



<P>desperate expedition against Diabolus, and against his



<P>Diabolonian army; and the lot fell to Captain Credence, to



<P>Captain Experience, and to Captain Good-Hope, to lead the



<P>forlorn hope.&nbsp; (This Captain Experience the Prince created



<P>such when himself did reside in the town of Mansoul.)&nbsp; So, as



<P>I said, they made their sally out upon the army that lay in



<P>the siege against them; and their hap was to fall in with the



<P>main body of their enemies.&nbsp; Now Diabolus and his men being



<P>expertly accustomed to night-work, took the alarm presently,



<P>and were as ready to give them battle, as if they had sent



<P>them word of their coming.&nbsp; Wherefore to it they went amain,



<P>and blows were hard on every side; the hell drum also was



<P>beat most furiously, while the trumpets of the Prince most



<P>sweetly sounded.&nbsp; And thus the battle was joined; and Captain



<P>Insatiable looked to the enemy's carriages, and waited when



<P>he should receive some prey.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Prince's captains fought it stoutly, beyond what indeed



<P>could be expected they should; they wounded many; they made



<P>the whole army of Diabolus to make a retreat.&nbsp; But I cannot



<P>tell how, but the brave Captain Credence, Captain Good-Hope,



<P>and Captain Experience, as they were upon the pursuit,



<P>cutting down, and following hard after the enemy in the rear,



<P>Captain Credence stumbled and fell, by which fall he caught



<P>so great a hurt, that he could not rise till Captain



<P>Experience did help him up, at which their men were put in



<P>disorder.&nbsp; The captain also was so full of pain, that he



<P>could not forbear but aloud to cry out: at this, the other



<P>two captains fainted, supposing that Captain Credence had



<P>received his mortal wound; their men also were more



<P>disordered, and had no list to fight.&nbsp; Now Diabolus being



<P>very observing, though at this time as yet he was put to the



<P>worst, perceiving that a halt was made among the men that



<P>were the pursuers, what does he but, taking it for granted



<P>that the captains were either wounded or dead, he therefore



<P>makes at first a stand, then faces about, and so comes up



<P>upon the Prince's army with as much of his fury as hell could



<P>help him to; and his hap was to fall in just among the three



<P>captains, Captain Credence, Captain Good-Hope, and Captain



<P>Experience, and did cut, wound, and pierce them so



<P>dreadfully, that what through discouragement, what through



<P>disorder, and what through the wounds that they had received,



<P>and also the loss of much blood, they scarce were able,



<P>though they had for their power the three best hands in



<P>Mansoul, to get safe into the hold again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when the body of the Prince's army saw how these three



<P>captains were put to the worst, they thought it their wisdom



<P>to make as safe and good a retreat as they could, and so



<P>returned by the sally-port again; and so there was an end of



<P>this present action.&nbsp; But Diabolus was so flushed with this



<P>night's work, that he promised himself, in few days, an easy



<P>and complete conquest over the town of Mansoul; wherefore, on



<P>the day following, he comes up to the sides thereof with



<P>great boldness, and demands entrance, and that forthwith they



<P>deliver themselves up to his government.&nbsp; The Diabolonians,



<P>too, that were within, they began to be somewhat brisk, as we



<P>shall show afterward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the valiant Lord Mayor replied, that what he got he must



<P>get by force; for as long as Emmanuel, their Prince, was



<P>alive, (though he at present was not so with them as they



<P>wished,) they should never consent to yield Mansoul up to



<P>another.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And with that the Lord Willbewill stood up, and said,



<P>'Diabolus, thou master of the den, and enemy to all that is



<P>good, we poor inhabitants of the town of Mansoul are too well



<P>acquainted with thy rule and government, and with the end of



<P>those things that for certain will follow submitting to thee,



<P>to do it.&nbsp; Wherefore though while we were without knowledge



<P>we suffered thee to take us, (as the bird that saw not the



<P>snare fell into the hands of the fowler,) yet since we have



<P>been turned from darkness to light, we have also been turned



<P>from the power of Satan to God.&nbsp; And though through thy



<P>subtlety, and also the subtlety of the Diabolonians within,



<P>we have sustained much loss, and also plunged ourselves into



<P>much perplexity, yet give up ourselves, lay down our arms,



<P>and yield to so horrid a tyrant as thou, we shall not; die



<P>upon the place we choose rather to do.&nbsp; Besides, we have



<P>hopes that in time deliverance will come from court unto us,



<P>and therefore we yet will maintain a war against thee.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This brave speech of the Lord Willbewill, with that also of



<P>the Lord Mayor, did somewhat abate the boldness of Diabolus,



<P>though it kindled the fury of his rage.&nbsp; It also succoured



<P>the townsmen and captains; yea, it was as a plaster to the



<P>brave Captain Credence's wound; for you must know that a



<P>brave speech now (when the captains of the town with their



<P>men of war came home routed, and when the enemy took courage



<P>and boldness at the success that he had obtained to draw up



<P>to the walls, and demand entrance, as he did) was in season,



<P>and also advantageous.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Lord Willbewill also did play the man within; for while



<P>the captains and soldiers were in the field, he was in arms



<P>in the town, and wherever by him there was a Diabolonian



<P>found, they were forced to feel the weight of his heavy hand,



<P>and also the edge of his penetrating sword: many therefore of



<P>the Diabolonians he wounded, as the Lord Cavil, the Lord



<P>Brisk, the Lord Pragmatic, and the Lord Murmur; several also



<P>of the meaner sort he did sorely maim; though there cannot at



<P>this time an account be given you of any that he slew



<P>outright.&nbsp; The cause, or rather the advantage that my Lord



<P>Willbewill had at this time to do thus, was for that the



<P>captains were gone out to fight the enemy in the field.&nbsp; 'For



<P>now,' thought the Diabolonians within, 'is our time to stir



<P>and make an uproar in the town.'&nbsp; What do they therefore but



<P>quickly get themselves into a body, and fall forthwith to



<P>hurricaning in Mansoul, as if now nothing but whirlwind and



<P>tempest should be there.&nbsp; Wherefore, as I said, he takes this



<P>opportunity to fall in among them with his men, cutting and



<P>slashing with courage that was undaunted; at which the



<P>Diabolonians with all haste dispersed themselves to their



<P>holds, and my lord to his place as before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This brave act of my lord did somewhat revenge the wrong done



<P>by Diabolus to the captains, and also did let them know that



<P>Mansoul was not to be parted with for the loss of a victory



<P>or two; wherefore the wing of the tyrant was clipped again,



<P>as to boasting, - I mean in comparison of what he would have



<P>done, if the Diabolonians had put the town to the same plight



<P>to which he had put the captains.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, Diabolus yet resolves to have the other bout with



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; 'For,' thought he, 'since I beat them once, I may



<P>beat them twice.'&nbsp; Wherefore he commanded his men to be ready



<P>at such an hour of the night, to make a fresh assault upon



<P>the town; and he gave it out in special that they should bend



<P>all their force against Feel-gate, and attempt to break into



<P>the town through that.&nbsp; The word that then he did give to his



<P>officers and soldiers was Hell-fire.&nbsp; 'And,' said he, 'if we



<P>break in upon them, as I wish we do, either with some, or



<P>with all our force, let them that break in look to it, that



<P>they forget not the word.&nbsp; And let nothing be heard in the



<P>town of Mansoul but, "Hell-fire!&nbsp; Hell-fire! Hell-fire!"'



<P>The drummer was also to beat without ceasing, and the



<P>standard-bearers were to display their colours; the soldiers,



<P>too, were to put on what courage they could, and to see that



<P>they played manfully their parts against the town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So when night was come, and all things by the tyrant made



<P>ready for the work, he suddenly makes his assault upon Feel-



<P>gate, and after he had awhile struggled there, he throws the



<P>gate wide open: for the truth is, those gates were but weak,



<P>and so most easily made to yield.&nbsp; When Diabolus had thus far



<P>made his attempt, he placed his captains (namely, Torment and



<P>No-Ease) there; so he attempted to press forward, but the



<P>Prince's captains came down upon him, and made his entrance



<P>more difficult than he desired.&nbsp; And, to speak truth, they



<P>made what resistance they could; but the three of their best



<P>and most valiant captains being wounded, and by their wounds



<P>made much incapable of doing the town that service they



<P>would, (and all the rest having more than their hands full of



<P>the doubters, and their captains that did follow Diabolus,)



<P>they were overpowered with force, nor could they keep them



<P>out of the town.&nbsp; Wherefore the Prince's men and their



<P>captains betook themselves to the castle, as to the



<P>stronghold of the town: and this they did partly for their



<P>own security, partly for the security of the town, and



<P>partly, or rather chiefly, to preserve to Emmanuel the



<P>prerogative-royal of Mansoul; for so was the castle of



<P>Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The captains therefore being fled into the castle, the enemy,



<P>without much resistance, possess themselves of the rest of



<P>the town, and spreading themselves as they went into every



<P>corner, they cried out as they marched, according to the



<P>command of the tyrant, 'Hell-fire! Hell-fire! Hell-fire!' so



<P>that nothing for a while throughout the town of Mansoul could



<P>be heard but the direful noise of 'Hell-fire!' together with



<P>the roaring of Diabolus's drum.&nbsp; And now did the clouds hang



<P>black over Mansoul, nor to reason did anything but ruin seem



<P>to attend it.&nbsp; Diabolus also quartered his soldiers in the



<P>houses of the inhabitants of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Yea, the



<P>subordinate preacher's house was as full of these outlandish



<P>doubters as ever it could hold, and so was my Lord Mayor's,



<P>and my Lord Willbewill's also.&nbsp; Yea, where was there a



<P>corner, a cottage, a barn, or a hogstye, that now was not



<P>full of these vermin?&nbsp; Yea, they turned the men of the town



<P>out of their houses, and would lie in their beds, and sit at



<P>their tables themselves.&nbsp; Ah, poor Mansoul! now thou feelest



<P>the fruits of sin, yea, what venom was in the flattering



<P>words of Mr. Carnal-Security!&nbsp; They made great havoc of



<P>whatever they laid their hands on; yea, they fired the town



<P>in several places; many young children also were by them



<P>dashed in pieces; and those that were yet unborn they



<P>destroyed in their mothers' wombs: for you must needs think



<P>that it could not now be otherwise; for what conscience, what



<P>pity, what bowels of compassion can any expect at the hands



<P>of outlandish doubters?&nbsp; Many in Mansoul that were women,



<P>both young and old, they forced, ravished, and beastlike



<P>abused, so that they swooned, miscarried, and many of them



<P>died, and so lay at the top of every street, and in all by-



<P>places of the town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And now did Mansoul seem to be nothing but a den of dragons,



<P>an emblem of hell, and a place of total darkness.&nbsp; Now did



<P>Mansoul lie almost like the barren wilderness; nothing but



<P>nettles, briars, thorns, weeds, and stinking things seemed



<P>now to cover the face of Mansoul.&nbsp; I told you before, how



<P>that these Diabolonian doubters turned the men of Mansoul out



<P>of their beds, and now I will add, they wounded them, they



<P>mauled them, yea, and almost brained many of them.&nbsp; Many did



<P>I say, yea most, if not all of them.&nbsp; Mr. Conscience they so



<P>wounded, yea, and his wounds so festered, that he could have



<P>no ease day nor night, but lay as if continually upon a rack;



<P>but that Shaddai rules all, certainly they had slain him



<P>outright.&nbsp; Mr. Lord Mayor they so abused that they almost put



<P>out his eyes; and had not my Lord Willbewill got into the



<P>castle, they intended to have chopped him all to pieces; for



<P>they did look upon him, as his heart now stood, to be one of



<P>the very worst that was in Mansoul against Diabolus and his



<P>crew.&nbsp; And indeed he hath shown himself a man, and more of



<P>his exploits you will hear of afterwards.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, a man might have walked for days together in Mansoul,



<P>and scarcely have seen one in the town that looked like a



<P>religious man.&nbsp; Oh, the fearful state of Mansoul now! now



<P>every corner swarmed with outlandish doubters; red-coats and



<P>black-coats walked the town by clusters, and filled up all



<P>the houses with hideous noises, vain songs, lying stories,



<P>and blasphemous language against Shaddai and his Son.&nbsp; Now



<P>also those Diabolonians that lurked in the walls and dens and



<P>holes that were in the town of Mansoul, came forth and showed



<P>themselves; yea, walked with open face in company with the



<P>doubters that were in Mansoul.&nbsp; Yea, they had more boldness



<P>now to walk the streets, to haunt the houses, and to show



<P>themselves abroad, than had any of the honest inhabitants of



<P>the now woful town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Diabolus and his outlandish men were not at peace in



<P>Mansoul; for they were not there entertained as were the



<P>captains and forces of Emmanuel: the townsmen did browbeat



<P>them what they could; nor did they partake or make stroy of



<P>any of the necessaries of Mansoul, but that which they seized



<P>on against the townsmen's will: what they could, they hid



<P>from them, and what they could not, they had with an ill-



<P>will.&nbsp; They, poor hearts! had rather have had their room than



<P>their company; but they were at present their captives, and



<P>their captives for the present they were forced to be.&nbsp; But,



<P>I say, they discountenanced them as much as they were able,



<P>and showed them all the dislike that they could.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The captains also from the castle did hold them in continual



<P>play with their slings, to the chafing and fretting of the



<P>minds of the enemies.&nbsp; True, Diabolus made a great many



<P>attempts to have broken open the gates of the castle, but Mr.



<P>Godly-Fear was made the keeper of that; and he was a man of



<P>that courage, conduct, and valour, that it was in vain, as



<P>long as life lasted within him, to think to do that work,



<P>though mostly desired; wherefore all the attempts that



<P>Diabolus made against him were fruitless.&nbsp; I have wished



<P>sometimes that that man had had the whole rule of the town of



<P>Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, this was the condition of the town of Mansoul for about



<P>two years and a half: the body of the town was the seat of



<P>war, the people of the town were driven into holes, and the



<P>glory of Mansoul was laid in the dust.&nbsp; What rest, then,



<P>could be to the inhabitants, what peace could Mansoul have,



<P>and what sun could shine upon it?&nbsp; Had the enemy lain so long



<P>without in the plain against the town, it had been enough to



<P>have famished them: but now, when they shall be within, when



<P>the town shall be their tent, their trench and fort against



<P>the castle that was in the town; when the town shall be



<P>against the town, and shall serve to be a defence to the



<P>enemies of her strength and life: I say, when they shall make



<P>use of the forts and town-holds to secure themselves in, even



<P>till they shall take, spoil, and demolish the castle, - this



<P>was terrible! and yet this was now the state of the town of



<P>Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After the town of Mansoul had been in this sad and lamentable



<P>condition, for so long a time as I have told you, and no



<P>petitions that they presented their Prince with, all this



<P>while, could prevail, the inhabitants of the town, namely,



<P>the elders and chief of Mansoul, gathered together, and,



<P>after some time spent in condoling their miserable state and



<P>this miserable judgment coming upon them, they agreed



<P>together to draw up yet another petition, and to send it away



<P>to Emmanuel for relief.&nbsp; But Mr. Godly-Fear stood up and



<P>answered, that he knew that his Lord the Prince never did nor



<P>ever would receive a petition for these matters, from the



<P>hand of any whoever, unless the Lord Secretary's hand was to



<P>it; 'and this,' quoth he, 'is the reason that you prevailed



<P>not all this while.'&nbsp; Then they said they would draw up one,



<P>and get the Lord Secretary's hand unto it.&nbsp; But Mr. Godly-



<P>Fear answered again, that he knew also that the Lord



<P>Secretary would not set his hand to any petition that himself



<P>had not an hand in composing and drawing up.&nbsp; 'And besides,'



<P>said he, 'the Prince doth know my Lord Secretary's hand from



<P>all the hands in the world; wherefore he cannot be deceived



<P>by any pretence whatever.&nbsp; Wherefore my advice is that you go



<P>to my Lord, and implore him to lend you his aid.'&nbsp; (Now he



<P>did yet abide in the castle, where all the captains and men-



<P>at-arms were.)

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So they heartily thanked Mr. Godly-Fear, took his counsel,



<P>and did as he had bidden them.&nbsp; So they went and came to my



<P>Lord, and made known the cause of their coming to him;



<P>namely, that since Mansoul was in so deplorable a condition,



<P>his Highness would be pleased to undertake to draw up a



<P>petition for them to Emmanuel, the Son of the mighty Shaddai,



<P>and to their King and his Father by him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Secretary to them, 'What petition is it that



<P>you would have me draw up for you?'&nbsp; But they said, 'Our Lord



<P>knows best the state and condition of the town of Mansoul;



<P>and how we are backslidden and degenerated from the Prince:



<P>thou also knowest who is come up to war against us, and how



<P>Mansoul is now the seat of war.&nbsp; My Lord knows, moreover,



<P>what barbarous usages our men, women, and children have



<P>suffered at their hands; and how our homebred Diabolonians do



<P>walk now with more boldness than dare the townsmen in the



<P>streets of Mansoul.&nbsp; Let our Lord therefore, according to the



<P>wisdom of God that is in him, draw up a petition for his poor



<P>servants to our Prince Emmanuel.'&nbsp; 'Well,' said the Lord



<P>Secretary, 'I will draw up a petition for you, and will also



<P>set my hand thereto.'&nbsp; Then said they, 'But when shall we



<P>call for it at the hands of our Lord?'&nbsp; But he answered,



<P>'Yourselves must be present at the doing of it; yea, you must



<P>put your desires to it.&nbsp; True, the hand and pen shall be



<P>mine, but the ink and paper must be yours; else how can you



<P>say it is your petition?&nbsp; Nor have I need to petition for



<P>myself, because I have not offended.' He also added as



<P>followeth: 'No petition goes from me in my name to the



<P>Prince, and so to his Father by him, but when the people that



<P>are chiefly concerned therein do join in heart and soul in



<P>the matter, for that must be inserted therein.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So they did heartily agree with the sentence of the Lord, and



<P>a petition was forthwith drawn up for them.&nbsp; But now, who



<P>should carry it? that was next.&nbsp; But the Secretary advised



<P>that Captain Credence should carry it; for he was a well-



<P>spoken man.&nbsp; They therefore called for him, and propounded to



<P>him the business.&nbsp; 'Well,' said the captain, 'I gladly accept



<P>of the motion; and though I am lame, I will do this business



<P>for you with as much speed, and as well as I can.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The contents of the petition were to this purpose

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'O our Lord, and Sovereign Prince Emmanuel, the potent, the



<P>long-suffering Prince! grace is poured into thy lips, and to



<P>thee belong mercy and forgiveness, though we have rebelled



<P>against thee.&nbsp; We, who are no more worthy to be called thy



<P>Mansoul, nor yet fit to partake of common benefits, do



<P>beseech thee, and thy Father by thee, to do away our



<P>transgressions.&nbsp; We confess that thou mightest cast us away



<P>for them; but do it not for thy name's sake: let the Lord



<P>rather take an opportunity, at our miserable condition, to



<P>let out his bowels and compassions to us.&nbsp; We are compassed



<P>on every side, Lord; our own backslidings reprove us; our



<P>Diabolonians within our town fright us; and the army of the



<P>angel of the bottomless pit distresses us.&nbsp; Thy grace can be



<P>our salvation, and whither to go but to thee we know not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Furthermore, O gracious Prince, we have weakened our



<P>captains, and they are discouraged, sick, and, of late, some



<P>of them grievously worsted and beaten out of the field by the



<P>power and force of the tyrant.&nbsp; Yea, even those of our



<P>captains, in whose valour we did formerly use to put most of



<P>our confidence, they are as wounded men.&nbsp; Besides, Lord, our



<P>enemies are lively, and they are strong; they vaunt and boast



<P>themselves, and do threaten to part us among themselves for a



<P>booty.&nbsp; They are fallen also upon us, Lord, with many



<P>thousand doubters, such as with whom we cannot tell what to



<P>do; they are all grim-looked and unmerciful ones, and they



<P>bid defiance to us and thee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Our wisdom is gone, our power is gone, because thou art



<P>departed from us; nor have we what we may call ours but sin,



<P>shame, and confusion of face for sin.&nbsp; Take pity upon us, O



<P>Lord, take pity upon us, thy miserable town of Mansoul, and



<P>save us out of the hands of our enemies.&nbsp; Amen.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This petition, as was touched afore, was handed by the Lord



<P>Secretary, and carried to the court by the brave and most



<P>stout Captain Credence.&nbsp; Now he carried it out at Mouth-gate,



<P>(for that, as I said, was the sally-port of the town,) and he



<P>went and came to Emmanuel with it.&nbsp; Now how it came out, I do



<P>not know; but for certain it did, and that so far as to reach



<P>the ears of Diabolus.&nbsp; Thus I conclude, because that the



<P>tyrant had it presently by the end, and charged the town of



<P>Mansoul with it, saying, 'Thou rebellious and stubborn-



<P>hearted Mansoul, I will make thee to leave off petitioning.



<P>Art thou yet for petitioning?&nbsp; I will make thee to leave.'



<P>Yea, he also knew who the messenger was that carried the



<P>petition to the Prince, and it made him both to fear and



<P>rage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wherefore he commanded that his drum should be beat again, a



<P>thing that Mansoul could not abide to hear: but when Diabolus



<P>will have his drum beat, Mansoul must abide the noise.&nbsp; Well,



<P>the drum was beat, and the Diabolonians were gathered



<P>together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Diabolus, 'O ye stout Diabolonians, be it known



<P>unto you, that there is treachery hatched against us in the



<P>rebellious town of Mansoul; for albeit the town is in our



<P>possession, as you see, yet these miserable Mansoulians have



<P>attempted to dare, and have been so hardy as yet to send to



<P>the court to Emmanuel for help.&nbsp; This I give you to



<P>understand, that ye may yet know how to carry it to the



<P>wretched town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Wherefore, O my trusty



<P>Diabolonians, I command that yet more and more ye distress



<P>this town of Mansoul, and vex it with your wiles, ravish



<P>their women, deflower their virgins, slay their children,



<P>brain their ancients, fire their town, and what other



<P>mischief you can; and let this be the reward of the



<P>Mansoulians from me, for their desperate rebellions against



<P>me.'

<P>HATE.&nbsp; My lord, I have heard this Forget-Good say, that he



<P>could never abide to think of goodness, no, not for a quarter



<P>of an hour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Where did you hear him say so?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HATE.&nbsp; In All-base Lane, at a house next door to the sign of



<P>the Conscience seared with a hot iron.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Know-All, what can you say for our Lord the King



<P>against the prisoner at the bar?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>KNOW.&nbsp; My lord, I know this man well.&nbsp; He is a Diabolonian,



<P>the son of a Diabolonian: his father's name was Love-Naught;



<P>and for him, I have often heard him say, that he counted the



<P>very thoughts of goodness the most burdensome thing in the



<P>world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Where have you heard him say these words?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>KNOW.&nbsp; In Flesh Lane, right opposite to the church.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Clerk, 'Come, Mr. Tell-True, give in your



<P>evidence concerning the prisoner at the bar, about that for



<P>which he stands here, as you see, indicted by this honourable



<P>Court.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TELL.&nbsp; My lord, I have heard him often say he had rather



<P>think of the vilest thing than of what is contained in the



<P>Holy Scriptures.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Where did you hear him say such grievous words?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TELL.&nbsp; Where? - in a great many places, particularly in



<P>Nauseous Street, in the house of one Shameless, and in Filth



<P>Lane, at the sign of the Reprobate, next door to the Descent



<P>into the Pit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>COURT.&nbsp; Gentlemen, you have heard the indictment, his plea,



<P>and the testimony of the witnesses.&nbsp; Gaoler, set Mr. Hard-



<P>Heart to the bar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He is set to the bar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Hard-Heart, thou art here indicted by the name of



<P>Hard-Heart, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for that



<P>thou didst most desperately and wickedly possess the town of



<P>Mansoul with impenitency and obdurateness; and didst keep



<P>them from remorse and sorrow for their evils, all the time of



<P>their apostacy from and rebellion against the blessed King



<P>Shaddai.&nbsp; What sayest thou to this indictment?&nbsp; Art thou



<P>guilty, or not guilty?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HARD.&nbsp; My lord, I never knew what remorse or sorrow meant in



<P>all my life.&nbsp; I am impenetrable.&nbsp; I care for no man; nor can



<P>I be pierced with men's griefs; their groans will not enter



<P>into my heart.&nbsp; Whomsoever I mischief, whomsoever I wrong, to



<P>me it is music, when to others mourning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>COURT.&nbsp; You see the man is a right Diabolonian, and has



<P>convicted himself.&nbsp; Set him by, gaoler, and set Mr. False-



<P>Peace to the bar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>False-Peace set to the bar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. False-Peace, thou art here indicted by the name of



<P>False-Peace, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for that



<P>thou didst most wickedly and satanically bring, hold, and



<P>keep the town of Mansoul, both in her apostacy and in her



<P>hellish rebellion, in a false, groundless, and dangerous



<P>peace, and damnable security, to the dishonour of the King,



<P>the transgression of his law, and the great damage of the



<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; What sayest thou?&nbsp; Art thou guilty of this



<P>indictment, or not?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Mr. False-Peace: 'Gentlemen, and you now appointed



<P>to be my judges, I acknowledge that my name is Mr. Peace; but



<P>that my name is False-Peace I utterly deny.&nbsp; If your honours



<P>shall please to send for any that do intimately know me, or



<P>for the midwife that laid my mother of me, or for the gossips



<P>that were at my christening, they will, any or all of them,



<P>prove that my name is not False-Peace, but Peace.&nbsp; Wherefore



<P>I cannot plead to this indictment, forasmuch as my name is



<P>not inserted therein; and as is my true name, so are also my



<P>conditions.&nbsp; I was always a man that loved to live at quiet,



<P>and what I loved myself, that I thought others might love



<P>also.&nbsp; Wherefore, when I saw any of my neighbours to labour



<P>under a disquieted mind, I endeavoured to help them what I



<P>could; and instances of this good temper of mine many I could



<P>give; as,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'1. When, at the beginning, our town of Mansoul did decline



<P>the ways of Shaddai, they, some of them, afterwards began to



<P>have disquieting reflections upon themselves for what they



<P>had done; but I, as one troubled to see them disquieted,



<P>presently sought out means to get them quiet again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'2. When the ways of the old world, and of Sodom, were in



<P>fashion, if anything happened to molest those that were for



<P>the customs of the present times, I laboured to make them



<P>quiet again, and to cause them to act without molestation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'3. To come nearer home: when the wars fell out between



<P>Shaddai and Diabolus, if at any time I saw any of the town of



<P>Mansoul afraid of destruction, I often used, by some way,



<P>device, invention, or other, to labour to bring them to peace



<P>again.&nbsp; Wherefore, since I have been always a man of so



<P>virtuous a temper as some say a peace-maker is, and if a



<P>peace-maker be so deserving a man as some have been bold to



<P>attest he is, then let me, gentlemen, be accounted by you,



<P>who have a great name for justice and equity in Mansoul, for



<P>a man that deserveth not this inhuman way of treatment, but



<P>liberty, and also a license to seek damage of those that have



<P>been my accusers.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the clerk, 'Crier, make a proclamation.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CRIER.&nbsp; Oyes!&nbsp; Forasmuch as the prisoner at the bar hath



<P>denied his name to be that which is mentioned in the



<P>indictment, the Court requireth that if there be any in this



<P>place that can give information to the Court of the original



<P>and right name of the prisoner, they would come forth and



<P>give in their evidence; for the prisoner stands upon his own



<P>innocency.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then came two into the court, and desired that they might



<P>have leave to speak what they knew concerning the prisoner at



<P>the bar: the name of the one was Search-Truth, and the name



<P>of the other Vouch-Truth.&nbsp; So the Court demanded of these men



<P>if they knew the prisoner, and what they could say concerning



<P>him, 'for he stands,' said they, 'upon his own vindication.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Mr. Search-Truth, 'My Lord, I - '

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>COURT.&nbsp; Hold! give him his oath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then they sware him.&nbsp; So he proceeded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>SEARCH.&nbsp; My lord, I know and have known this man from a



<P>child, and can attest that his name is False-Peace.&nbsp; I know



<P>his father; his name was Mr. Flatter: and his mother, before



<P>she was married, was called by the name of Mrs. Sooth-Up: and



<P>these two, when they came together, lived not long without



<P>this son; and when he was born, they called his name False-



<P>Peace.&nbsp; I was his play-fellow, only I was somewhat older than



<P>he; and when his mother did use to call him home from his



<P>play, she used to say, 'False-Peace, False-Peace, come home



<P>quick, or I'll fetch you.'&nbsp; Yea, I knew him when he sucked;



<P>and though I was then but little, yet I can remember that



<P>when his mother did use to sit at the door with him, or did



<P>play with him in her arms, she would call him, twenty times



<P>together, 'My little False-Peace! my pretty False-Peace!'



<P>and, 'Oh! my sweet rogue, False-Peace!' and again, 'Oh! my



<P>little bird, False-Peace!' and 'How do I love my child!'&nbsp; The



<P>gossips also know it is thus, though he has had the face to



<P>deny it in open court.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then Mr. Vouch-Truth was called upon to speak what he knew of



<P>him.&nbsp; So they sware him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Mr. Vouch-Truth, 'My lord, all that the former



<P>witness hath said is true.&nbsp; His name is False-Peace, the son



<P>of Mr. Flatter, and of Mrs. Sooth-Up, his mother: and I have



<P>in former times seen him angry with those that have called



<P>him anything else but False-Peace, for he would say that all



<P>such did mock and nickname him; but this was in the time when



<P>Mr. False-Peace was a great man, and when the Diabolonians



<P>were the brave men in Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>COURT.&nbsp; Gentlemen, you have heard what these two men have



<P>sworn against the prisoner at the bar.&nbsp; And now, Mr. False-



<P>Peace, to you: you have denied your name to be False-Peace,



<P>yet you see that these honest men have sworn that that is



<P>your name.&nbsp; As to your plea, in that you are quite besides



<P>the matter of your indictment, you are not by it charged for



<P>evil-doing because you are a man of peace, or a peace-maker



<P>among your neighbours; but for that you did wickedly and



<P>satanically bring, keep, and hold the town of Mansoul, both



<P>under its apostasy from, and in its rebellion against its



<P>King, in a false, lying, and damnable peace, contrary to the



<P>law of Shaddai, and to the hazard of the destruction of the



<P>then miserable town of Mansoul.&nbsp; All that you have pleaded



<P>for yourself is, that you have denied your name, etc.; but



<P>here, you see, we have witnesses to prove that you are the



<P>man.&nbsp; For the peace that you so much boast of making among



<P>your neighbours, know that peace that is not a companion of



<P>truth and holiness, but that which is without this



<P>foundation, is grounded upon a lie, and is both deceitful and



<P>damnable, as also the great Shaddai hath said.&nbsp; Thy plea,



<P>therefore, has not delivered thee from what by the indictment



<P>thou art charged with, but rather it doth fasten all upon



<P>thee.&nbsp; But thou shalt have very fair play.&nbsp; Let us call the



<P>witnesses that are to testify as to matter of fact, and see



<P>what they have to say for our Lord the King against the



<P>prisoner at the bar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Know-All, what say you for our Lord the King



<P>against the prisoner at the bar?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>KNOW.&nbsp; My lord, this man hath of a long time made it, to my



<P>knowledge, his business to keep the town of Mansoul in a



<P>sinful quietness in the midst of all her lewdness,



<P>filthiness, and turmoils, and hath said, and that in my



<P>hearing, Come, come, let us fly from all trouble, on what



<P>ground soever it comes, and let us be for a quiet and



<P>peaceable life, though it wanteth a good foundation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Come, Mr. Hate-Lies, what have you to say?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HATE.&nbsp; My lord, I have heard him say, that peace, though in a



<P>way of unrighteousness, is better than trouble with truth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Where did you hear him say this?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HATE.&nbsp; I heard him say it in Folly-yard, at the house of one



<P>Mr. Simple, next door to the sign of the Self-deceiver.&nbsp; Yea,



<P>he hath said this to my knowledge twenty times in that place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; We may spare further witness; this evidence is plain



<P>and full.&nbsp; Set him by, gaoler, and set Mr. No-Truth to the



<P>bar.&nbsp; Mr. No-Truth, thou art here indicted by the name of No-



<P>Truth, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for that thou



<P>hast always, to the dishonour of Shaddai, and the endangering



<P>of the utter ruin of the famous town of Mansoul, set thyself



<P>to deface, and utterly to spoil, all the remainders of the



<P>law and image of Shaddai that have been found in Mansoul



<P>after her deep apostasy from her king to Diabolus, the



<P>envious tyrant.&nbsp; What sayest thou, art thou guilty of this



<P>indictment, or not?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>NO.&nbsp; Not guilty, my lord.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then the witnesses were called, and Mr. Know-All did first



<P>give in his evidence against him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>KNOW.&nbsp; My lord, this man was at the pulling down of the image



<P>of Shaddai; yea, this is he that did it with his own hands.



<P>I myself stood by and saw him do it, and he did it at the



<P>commandment of Diabolus.&nbsp; Yea, this Mr. No-Truth did more



<P>than this, he did also set up the horned image of the beast



<P>Diabolus in the same place.&nbsp; This also is he that, at the



<P>bidding of Diabolus, did rend and tear, and cause to be



<P>consumed, all that he could of the remainders of the law of



<P>the King, even whatever he could lay his hands on in Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Who saw him do this besides yourself?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HATE.&nbsp; I did, my lord, and so did many more besides; for this



<P>was not done by stealth, or in a corner, but in the open view



<P>of all; yea, he chose himself to do it publicly, for he



<P>delighted in the doing of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. No-Truth, how could you have the face to plead



<P>not guilty, when you were so manifestly the doer of all this



<P>wickedness?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>NO.&nbsp; Sir, I thought I must say something, and as my name is,



<P>so I speak.&nbsp; I have been advantaged thereby before now, and



<P>did not know but by speaking no truth, I might have reaped



<P>the same benefit now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Set him by, gaoler, and set Mr. Pitiless to the bar.



<P>Mr. Pitiless, thou art here indicted by the name of Pitiless,



<P>(an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for that thou didst



<P>most traitorously and wickedly shut up all bowels of



<P>compassion, and wouldest not suffer poor Mansoul to condole



<P>her own misery when she had apostatised from her rightful



<P>King, but didst evade, and at all times turn her mind awry



<P>from those thoughts that had in them a tendency to lead her



<P>to repentance.&nbsp; What sayest thou to this indictment?&nbsp; Guilty



<P>or not guilty?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Not guilty of pitilessness: all I did was to cheer up,



<P>according to my name, for my name is not Pitiless, but Cheer-



<P>up; and I could not abide to see Mansoul inclined to



<P>melancholy.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; How! do you deny your name, and say it is not



<P>Pitiless, but Cheer-up? Call for the witnesses.&nbsp; What say



<P>you, the witnesses, to this plea?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>KNOW.&nbsp; My lord, his name is Pitiless; so he hath written



<P>himself in all papers of concern wherein he has had to do.



<P>But these Diabolonians love to counterfeit their names: Mr.



<P>Covetousness covers himself with the name of Good-Husbandry,



<P>or the like; Mr. Pride can, when need is, call himself Mr.



<P>Neat, Mr. Handsome, or the like; and so of all the rest of



<P>them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Tell-True, what say you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TELL.&nbsp; His name is Pitiless, my lord.&nbsp; I have known him from



<P>a child, and he hath done all that wickedness whereof he



<P>stands charged in the indictment; but there is a company of



<P>them that are not acquainted with the danger of damning,



<P>therefore they call all those melancholy that have serious



<P>thoughts how that state should be shunned by them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Set Mr. Haughty to the bar, gaoler.&nbsp; Mr. Haughty,



<P>thou art here indicted by the name of Haughty, (an intruder



<P>upon the town of Mansoul,) for that thou didst most



<P>traitorously and devilishly teach the town of Mansoul to



<P>carry it loftily and stoutly against the summons that was



<P>given them by the captains of the King Shaddai.&nbsp; Thou didst



<P>also teach the town of Mansoul to speak contemptuously and



<P>vilifyingly of their great King Shaddai; and didst moreover



<P>encourage, both by words and examples, Mansoul, to take up



<P>arms both against the King and his son Emmanuel.&nbsp; How sayest



<P>thou, art thou guilty of this indictment, or not?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HAUGHTY.&nbsp; Gentlemen, I have always been a man of courage and



<P>valour, and have not used, when under the greatest clouds, to



<P>sneak or hang down the head like a bulrush; nor did it at all



<P>at any time please me to see men veil their bonnets to those



<P>that have opposed them; yea, though their adversaries seemed



<P>to have ten times the advantage of them.&nbsp; I did not use to



<P>consider who was my foe, nor what the cause was in which I



<P>was engaged.&nbsp; It was enough to me if I carried it bravely,



<P>fought like a man, and came off a victor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>COURT.&nbsp; Mr. Haughty, you are not here indicted for that you



<P>have been a valiant man, nor for your courage and stoutness



<P>in times of distress, but for that you have made use of this



<P>your pretended valour to draw the town of Mansoul into acts



<P>of rebellion both against the great King, and Emmanuel his



<P>Son.&nbsp; This is the crime and the thing wherewith thou art



<P>charged in and by the indictment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But he made no answer to that.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now when the Court had thus far proceeded against the



<P>prisoners at the bar, then they put them over to the verdict



<P>of their jury, to whom they did apply themselves after this



<P>manner:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Gentlemen of the jury, you have been here, and have seen



<P>these men; you have heard their indictments, their pleas, and



<P>what the witnesses have testified against them: now what



<P>remains, is, that you do forthwith withdraw yourselves to



<P>some place, where without confusion you may consider of what



<P>verdict, in a way of truth and righteousness, you ought to



<P>bring in for the King against them, and so bring it in



<P>accordingly.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then the jury, to wit, Mr. Belief, Mr. True-Heart, Mr.



<P>Upright, Mr. Hate-bad, Mr. Love-God, Mr. See-Truth, Mr.



<P>Heavenly-Mind, Mr. Moderate, Mr. Thankful, Mr. Humble, Mr.



<P>Good-Work, and Mr. Zeal-for-God, withdrew themselves in order



<P>to their work.&nbsp; Now when they were shut up by themselves,



<P>they fell to discourse among themselves in order to the



<P>drawing up of their verdict.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And thus Mr. Belief (for he was the foreman) began:



<P>'Gentlemen,' quoth he, 'for the men, the prisoners at the



<P>bar, for my part I believe that they all deserve death.'



<P>'Very right,' said Mr. True-Heart; 'I am wholly of your



<P>opinion.'&nbsp; 'Oh what a mercy is it,' said Mr. Hate-Bad, 'that



<P>such villains as these are apprehended!'&nbsp; 'Ay! ay!' said Mr.



<P>Love-God, 'this is one of the joyfullest days that ever I saw



<P>in my life.'&nbsp; Then said Mr. See-Truth, 'I know that if we



<P>judge them to death, our verdict shall stand before Shaddai



<P>himself'&nbsp; 'Nor do I at all question it,' said Mr. Heavenly-



<P>Mind; he said, moreover, 'When all such beasts as these are



<P>cast out of Mansoul, what a goodly town will it be then!'



<P>'Then,' said Mr. Moderate, 'it is not my manner to pass my



<P>judgment with rashness; but for these their crimes are so



<P>notorious, and the witness so palpable, that that man must be



<P>wilfully blind who saith the prisoners ought not to die.'



<P>'Blessed be God,' said Mr. Thankful, 'that the traitors are



<P>in safe custody.'&nbsp; 'And I join with you in this upon my bare



<P>knees,' said Mr. Humble.&nbsp; 'I am glad also,' said Mr. Good-



<P>Work.&nbsp; Then said the warm man, and true-hearted Mr. Zeal-for-



<P>God, 'Cut them off; they have been the plague, and have



<P>sought the destruction of Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thus, therefore, being all agreed in their verdict, they come



<P>instantly into the Court.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Gentlemen of the jury, answer all to your names: Mr.



<P>Belief, one; Mr. True-Heart, two; Mr. Upright, three; Mr.



<P>Hate-Bad, four; Mr. Love-God, five; Mr. See-Truth, six; Mr.



<P>Heavenly-mind, seven; Mr. Moderate, eight; Mr. Thankful,



<P>nine; Mr. Humble, ten; Mr. Good-Work, eleven; and Mr. Zeal-



<P>for-God, twelve.&nbsp; Good men and true, stand together in your



<P>verdict: are you all agreed?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>JURY.&nbsp; Yes, my lord.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Who shall speak for you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>JURY.&nbsp; Our foreman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; You, the gentlemen of the jury, being empannelled for



<P>our Lord the King, to serve here in a matter of life and



<P>death, have heard the trials of each of these men, the



<P>prisoners at the bar: what say you? are they guilty of that,



<P>and those crimes for which they stand here indicted, or are



<P>they not guilty?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FOREMAN.&nbsp; Guilty, my lord.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Look to your prisoners, gaoler.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was done in the morning, and in the afternoon they



<P>received the sentence of death according to the law.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The gaoler, therefore, having received such a charge, put



<P>them all in the inward prison, to preserve them there till



<P>the day of execution, which was to be the next day in the



<P>morning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But now to see how it happened, one of the prisoners,



<P>Incredulity by name, in the interim betwixt the sentence and



<P>the time of execution, brake prison and made his escape, and



<P>gets him away quite out of the town of Mansoul, and lay



<P>lurking in such places and holes as he might, until he should



<P>again have opportunity to do the town of Mansoul a mischief



<P>for their thus handling of him as they did.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now when Mr. Trueman, the gaoler, perceived that he had lost



<P>his prisoner, he was in a heavy taking, because that prisoner



<P>was, to speak on, the very worst of all the gang: wherefore



<P>first he goes and acquaints my Lord Mayor, Mr. Recorder, and



<P>my Lord Willbewill, with the matter, and to get of them an



<P>order to make search for him throughout the town of Mansoul.



<P>So an order he got, and search was made, but no such man



<P>could now be found in all the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All that could be gathered was, that he had lurked a while



<P>about the outside of the town, and that here and there one or



<P>other had a glimpse of him as he did make his escape out of



<P>Mansoul; one or two also did affirm that they saw him without



<P>the town, going apace quite over the plain.&nbsp; Now when he was



<P>quite gone, it was affirmed by one Mr. Did-see, that he



<P>ranged all over dry places, till he met with Diabolus, his



<P>friend, and where should they meet one another but just upon



<P>Hell-gate hill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But oh! what a lamentable story did the old gentleman tell to



<P>Diabolus concerning what sad alteration Emmanuel had made in



<P>Mansoul!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As, first, how Mansoul had, after some delays, received a



<P>general pardon at the hands of Emmanuel, and that they had



<P>invited him into the town, and that they had given him the



<P>castle for his possession.&nbsp; He said, moreover, that they had



<P>called his soldiers into the town, coveted who should quarter



<P>the most of them; they also entertained him with the timbrel,



<P>song, and dance.&nbsp; 'But that,' said Incredulity, 'which is the



<P>sorest vexation to me is, that he hath pulled down, O father,



<P>thy image, and set up his own; pulled down thy officers and



<P>set up his own.&nbsp; Yea, and Willbewill, that rebel, who, one



<P>would have thought, should never have turned from us, he is



<P>now in as great favour with Emmanuel as ever he was with



<P>thee.&nbsp; But, besides all this, this Willbewill has received a



<P>special commission from his master to search for, to



<P>apprehend, and to put to death all, and all manner of



<P>Diabolonians that he shall find in Mansoul: yea, and this



<P>Willbewill has taken and committed to prison already eight of



<P>my Lord's most trusty friends in Mansoul.&nbsp; Nay, further, my



<P>Lord, with grief I speak it, they have been all arraigned,



<P>condemned, and, I doubt, before this executed in Mansoul.&nbsp; I



<P>told my Lord of eight, and myself was the ninth, who should



<P>assuredly have drunk of the same cup, but that through craft,



<P>I, as thou seest, have made mine escape from them.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Diabolus had heard this lamentable story, he yelled and



<P>snuffed up the wind like a dragon, and made the sky to look



<P>dark with his roaring; he also sware that he would try to be



<P>revenged on Mansoul for this.&nbsp; So they, both he and his old



<P>friend Incredulity, concluded to enter into great



<P>consultation, how they might get the town of Mansoul again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, before this time, the day was come in which the



<P>prisoners in Mansoul were to be executed.&nbsp; So they were



<P>brought to the cross, and that by Mansoul, in most solemn



<P>manner; for the Prince said that this should be done by the



<P>hand of the town of Mansoul, 'that I may see,' said he, 'the



<P>forwardness of my now redeemed Mansoul to keep my word, and



<P>to do my commandments; and that I may bless Mansoul in doing



<P>this deed.&nbsp; Proof of sincerity pleases me well; let Mansoul



<P>therefore first lay their hands upon these Diabolonians to



<P>destroy them.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So the town of Mansoul slew them, according to the word of



<P>their Prince; but when the prisoners were brought to the



<P>cross to die, you can hardly believe what troublesome work



<P>Mansoul had of it to put the Diabolonians to death; for the



<P>men, knowing that they must die, and every of them having



<P>implacable enmity in their hearts to Mansoul, what did they



<P>but took courage at the cross, and there resisted the men of



<P>the town of Mansoul?&nbsp; Wherefore the men of Mansoul were



<P>forced to cry out for help to the captains and men of war.



<P>Now the great Shaddai had a secretary in the town, and he was



<P>a great lover of the men of Mansoul, and he was at the place



<P>of execution also; so he, hearing the men of Mansoul cry out



<P>against the strugglings and unruliness of the prisoners, rose



<P>up from his place, and came and put his hands upon the hands



<P>of the men of Mansoul.&nbsp; So they crucified the Diabolonians



<P>that had been a plague, a grief, and an offence to the town



<P>of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when this good work was done, the Prince came down to



<P>see, to visit, and to speak comfortably to the men of



<P>Mansoul, and to strengthen their hands in such work.&nbsp; And he



<P>said to them that, by this act of theirs he had proved them,



<P>and found them to be lovers of his person, observers of his



<P>laws, and such as had also respect to his honour.&nbsp; He said,



<P>moreover, (to show them that they by this should not be



<P>losers, nor their town weakened by the loss of them,) that he



<P>would make them another captain, and that of one of



<P>themselves.&nbsp; And that this captain should be the ruler of a



<P>thousand, for the good and benefit of the now flourishing



<P>town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So he called one to him whose name was Waiting, and bid him,



<P>'Go quickly up to the castle gate, and inquire there for one



<P>Mr. Experience, that waiteth upon that noble captain, the



<P>Captain Credence, and bid him come hither to me.'&nbsp; So the



<P>messenger that waited upon the good Prince Emmanuel went and



<P>said as he was commanded.&nbsp; Now the young gentleman was



<P>waiting to see the captain train and muster his men in the



<P>castle yard.&nbsp; Then said Mr. Waiting to him, 'Sir, the Prince



<P>would that you should come down to his highness forthwith.'



<P>So he brought him down to Emmanuel, and he came and made



<P>obeisance before him.&nbsp; Now the men of the town knew Mr.



<P>Experience well, for he was born and bred in Mansoul; they



<P>also knew him to be a man of conduct, of valour, and a person



<P>prudent in matters; he was also a comely person, well-spoken,



<P>and very successful in his undertakings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wherefore the hearts of the townsmen were transported with



<P>joy when they saw that the Prince himself was so taken with



<P>Mr. Experience, that he would needs make him a captain over a



<P>band of men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So with one consent they bowed the knee before Emmanuel, and



<P>with a shout said, 'Let Emmanuel live for ever!'&nbsp; Then said



<P>the Prince to the young gentleman, whose name was Mr.



<P>Experience, 'I have thought good to confer upon thee a place



<P>of trust and honour in this my town of Mansoul.'&nbsp; Then the



<P>young man bowed his head and worshipped.&nbsp; 'It is,' said



<P>Emmanuel, 'that thou shouldest be a captain, a captain over a



<P>thousand men in my beloved town of Mansoul.'&nbsp; Then said the



<P>captain, 'Let the King live!'&nbsp; So the Prince gave out orders



<P>forthwith to the King's secretary, that he should draw up for



<P>Mr. Experience a commission to make him a captain over a



<P>thousand men.&nbsp; 'And let it be brought to me,' said he, 'that



<P>I may set to my seal.'&nbsp; So it was done as it was commanded.



<P>The commission was drawn up, brought to Emmanuel, and he set



<P>his seal thereto.&nbsp; Then, by the hand of Mr. Waiting, he sent



<P>it away to the captain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now as soon as the captain had received his commission, he



<P>sounded his trumpet for volunteers, and young men came to him



<P>apace; yea, the greatest and chief men in the town sent their



<P>sons, to be listed under his command.&nbsp; Thus Captain



<P>Experience came under command to Emmanuel, for the good of



<P>the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; He had for his lieutenant one Mr.



<P>Skilful, and for his cornet one Mr. Memory.&nbsp; His under



<P>officers I need not name.&nbsp; His colours were the white colours



<P>for the town of Mansoul; and his scutcheon was the dead lion



<P>and dead bear.&nbsp; So the Prince returned to his royal palace



<P>again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now when he was returned thither, the elders of the town of



<P>Mansoul, to wit, the Lord Mayor, the Recorder, and the Lord



<P>Willbewill, went to congratulate him, and in special way to



<P>thank him for his love, care, and the tender compassion which



<P>he showed to his ever-obliged town of Mansoul.&nbsp; So after a



<P>while, and some sweet communion between them, the townsmen



<P>having solemnly ended their ceremony, returned to their place



<P>again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emmanuel also at this time appointed them a day wherein he



<P>would renew their charter, yea, wherein he would renew and



<P>enlarge it, mending several faults therein, that Mansoul's



<P>yoke might be yet more easy.&nbsp; And this he did without any



<P>desire of theirs, even of his own frankness and noble mind.



<P>So when he had sent for and seen their old one, he laid it



<P>by, and said, 'Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is



<P>ready to vanish away.'&nbsp; He said, moreover, 'The town of



<P>Mansoul shall have another, a better, a new one, more steady



<P>and firm by far.'&nbsp; An epitome hereof take as follows:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Emmanuel, Prince of Peace, and a great lover of the town of



<P>Mansoul, I do in the name of my Father, and of mine own



<P>clemency, give, grant, and bequeath to my beloved town of



<P>Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'First.&nbsp; Free, full, and everlasting forgiveness of all



<P>wrongs, injuries, and offences done by them against my



<P>Father, me, their neighbour, or themselves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Second.&nbsp; I do give them the holy law and my testament, with



<P>all that therein is contained, for their everlasting comfort



<P>and consolation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Third.&nbsp; I do also give them a portion of the self-same grace



<P>and goodness that dwells in my Father's heart and mine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Fourth.&nbsp; I do give, grant, and bestow upon them freely, the



<P>world and what is therein, for their good; and they shall



<P>have that power over them, as shall stand with the honour of



<P>my Father, my glory, and their comfort: yea, I grant them the



<P>benefits of life and death, and of things present, and things



<P>to come.&nbsp; This privilege no other city, town, or corporation,



<P>shall have, but my Mansoul only.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Fifth.&nbsp; I do give and grant them leave, and free access to



<P>me in my palace at all seasons - to my palace above or below



<P>- there to make known their wants to me, and I give them,



<P>moreover, a promise that I will hear and redress all their



<P>grievances.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Sixth.&nbsp; I do give, grant to, and invest the town of Mansoul



<P>with full power and authority to seek out, take, enslave, and



<P>destroy all, and all manner of Diabolonians that at any time,



<P>from whencesoever, shall be found straggling in or about the



<P>town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Seventh.&nbsp; I do further grant to my beloved town of Mansoul,



<P>that they shall have authority not to suffer any foreigner,



<P>or stranger, or their seed, to be free in, and of the blessed



<P>town of Mansoul, nor to share in the excellent privileges



<P>thereof.&nbsp; But that all the grants, privileges, and immunities



<P>that I bestow upon the famous town of Mansoul, shall be for



<P>those the old natives, and true inhabitants thereof; to them,



<P>I say, and to their right seed after them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But all Diabolonians, of what sort, birth, country, or



<P>kingdom soever, shall be debarred a share therein.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So when the town of Mansoul had received at the hand of



<P>Emmanuel their gracious charter, (which in itself is



<P>infinitely more large than by this lean epitome is set before



<P>you,) they carried it to audience, that is, to the market



<P>place, and there Mr. Recorder read it in the presence of all



<P>the people.&nbsp; This being done, it was had back to the castle



<P>gates, and there fairly engraven upon the doors thereof, and



<P>laid in letters of gold, to the end that the town of Mansoul,



<P>with all the people thereof, might have it always in their



<P>view, or might go where they might see what a blessed freedom



<P>their Prince had bestowed upon them, that their joy might be



<P>increased in themselves, and their love renewed to their



<P>great and good Emmanuel.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But what joy, what comfort, what consolation, think you, did



<P>now possess the hearts of the men of Mansoul!&nbsp; The bells



<P>rung, the minstrels played, the people danced, the captains



<P>shouted, the colours waved in the wind, and the silver



<P>trumpets sounded; and the Diabolonians now were glad to hide



<P>their heads, for they looked like them that had been long



<P>dead.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When this was over, the Prince sent again for the elders of



<P>the town of Mansoul, and communed with them about a ministry



<P>that he intended to establish among them; such a ministry



<P>that might open unto them, and that might instruct them in



<P>the things that did concern their present and future state.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'For,' said he, 'you, of yourselves, unless you have teachers



<P>and guides, will not be able to know, and, if not to know, to



<P>be sure not to do the will of my Father.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At this news, when the elders of Mansoul brought it to the



<P>people, the whole town came running together, (for it pleased



<P>them well, as whatever the Prince now did pleased the



<P>people,) and all with one consent implored his Majesty that



<P>he would forthwith establish such a ministry among them as



<P>might teach them both law and judgment, statute and



<P>commandment; that they might be documented in all good and



<P>wholesome things.&nbsp; So he told them that he would grant them



<P>their requests, and would establish two among them; one that



<P>was of his Father's court, and one that was a native of



<P>Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'He that is from the court,' said he, 'is a person of no less



<P>quality and dignity than my Father and I; and he is the Lord



<P>Chief Secretary of my Father's house: for he is, and always



<P>has been, the chief dictator of all my Father's laws, a



<P>person altogether well skilled in all mysteries, and



<P>knowledge of mysteries, as is my Father, or as myself is.



<P>Indeed he is one with us in nature, and also as to loving of,



<P>and being faithful to, and in the eternal concerns of the



<P>town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And this is he,' said the Prince, 'that must be your chief



<P>teacher; for it is he, and he only, that can teach you



<P>clearly in all high and supernatural things.&nbsp; He, and he



<P>only, it is that knows the ways and methods of my Father at



<P>court, nor can any like him show how the heart of my Father



<P>is at all times, in all things, upon all occasions, towards



<P>Mansoul; for as no man knows the things of a man but that



<P>spirit of a man which is in him, so the things of my Father



<P>knows no man but this his high and mighty Secretary.&nbsp; Nor can



<P>any, as he, tell Mansoul how and what they shall do to keep



<P>themselves in the love of my Father.&nbsp; He also it is that can



<P>bring lost things to your remembrance, and that can tell you



<P>things to come.&nbsp; This teacher, therefore, must of necessity



<P>have the pre-eminence, both in your affections and judgment,



<P>before your other teacher; his personal dignity, the



<P>excellency of his teaching, also the great dexterity that he



<P>hath to help you to make and draw up petitions to my Father



<P>for your help, and to his pleasing, must lay obligations upon



<P>you to love him, fear him, and to take heed that you grieve



<P>him not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'This person can put life and vigour into all he says; yea,



<P>and can also put it into your heart.&nbsp; This person can make



<P>seers of you, and can make you tell what shall be hereafter.



<P>By this person you must frame all your petitions to my Father



<P>and me; and without his advice and counsel first obtained,



<P>let nothing enter into the town or castle of Mansoul, for



<P>that may disgust and grieve this noble person.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Take heed, I say, that you do not grieve this minister; for



<P>if you do, he may fight against you; and should he once be



<P>moved by you to set himself against you in battle array, that



<P>will distress you more than if twelve legions should from my



<P>Father's court be sent to make war upon you.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But, as I said, if you shall hearken unto him, and shall



<P>love him; if you shall devote yourselves to his teaching, and



<P>shall seek to have converse, and to maintain communion with



<P>him, you shall find him ten times better than is the whole



<P>world to any; yea, he will shed abroad the love of my Father



<P>in your hearts, and Mansoul will be the wisest, and most



<P>blessed of all people.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then did the Prince call unto him the old gentleman, who



<P>before had been the Recorder of Mansoul, Mr. Conscience by



<P>name, and told him, That, forasmuch as he was well skilled in



<P>the law and government of the town of Mansoul, and was also



<P>well-spoken, and could pertinently deliver to them his



<P>Master's will in all terrene and domestic matters, therefore



<P>he would also make him a minister for, in, and to the goodly



<P>town of Mansoul, in all the laws, statutes, and judgments of



<P>the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; 'And thou must,' said the



<P>Prince, 'confine thyself to the teaching of moral virtues, to



<P>civil and natural duties; but thou must not attempt to



<P>presume to be a revealer of those high and supernatural



<P>mysteries that are kept close in the bosom of Shaddai, my



<P>Father: for those things knows no man, nor can any reveal



<P>them but my Father's Secretary only.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Thou art a native of the town of Mansoul, but the Lord



<P>Secretary is a native with my Father; wherefore, as thou hast



<P>knowledge of the laws and customs of the corporation, so he



<P>of the things and will of my Father.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Wherefore, O Mr. Conscience, although I have made thee a



<P>minister and a preacher to the town of Mansoul, yet as to the



<P>things which the Lord Secretary knoweth, and shall teach to



<P>this people, there thou must be his scholar and a learner,



<P>even as the rest of Mansoul are.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Thou must therefore, in all high and supernatural things, go



<P>to him for information and knowledge; for though there be a



<P>spirit in man, this person's inspiration must give him



<P>understanding.&nbsp; Wherefore, O thou Mr. Recorder, keep low and



<P>be humble, and remember that the Diabolonians that kept not



<P>their first charge, but left their own standing, are now made



<P>prisoners in the pit.&nbsp; Be therefore content with thy station.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I have made thee my Father's vicegerent on earth, in such



<P>things of which I have made mention before: and thou, take



<P>thou power to teach them to Mansoul, yea, and to impose them



<P>with whips and chastisements, if they shall not willingly



<P>hearken to do thy commandments.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And, Mr. Recorder, because thou art old, and through many



<P>abuses made feeble; therefore I give thee leave and license



<P>to go when thou wilt to my fountain, my conduit, and there to



<P>drink freely of the blood of my grape, for my conduit doth



<P>always run wine.&nbsp; Thus doing, thou shalt drive from thine



<P>heart and stomach all foul, gross, and hurtful humours.&nbsp; It



<P>will also lighten thine eyes, and will strengthen thy memory



<P>for the reception and keeping of all that the King's most



<P>noble Secretary teacheth.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the Prince had thus put Mr. Recorder (that once so was)



<P>into the place and office of a minister to Mansoul, and the



<P>man had thankfully accepted thereof, then did Emmanuel



<P>address himself in a particular speech to the townsmen



<P>themselves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Behold,' said the Prince to Mansoul, 'my love and care



<P>towards you; I have added to all that is past, this mercy, to



<P>appoint you preachers; the most noble Secretary to teach you



<P>in all high and sublime mysteries; and this gentleman,'



<P>pointing to Mr. Conscience, 'is to teach you in all things



<P>human and domestic, for therein lieth his work.&nbsp; He is not,



<P>by what I have said, debarred of telling to Mansoul anything



<P>that he hath heard and received at the mouth of the lord high



<P>Secretary; only he shall not attempt to presume to pretend to



<P>be a revealer of those high mysteries himself; for the



<P>breaking of them up, and the discovery of them to Mansoul



<P>lieth only in the power, authority, and skill of the lord



<P>high Secretary himself.&nbsp; Talk of them he may, and so may the



<P>rest of the town of Mansoul; yea, and may, as occasion gives



<P>them opportunity, press them upon each other for the benefit



<P>of the whole.&nbsp; These things, therefore, I would have you



<P>observe and do, for it is for your life, and the lengthening



<P>of your days.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And one thing more to my beloved Mr. Recorder, and to all



<P>the town of Mansoul: You must not dwell in, nor stay upon,



<P>anything of that which he hath in commission to teach you, as



<P>to your trust and expectation of the next world; (of the next



<P>world, I say, for I purpose to give another to Mansoul, when



<P>this with them is worn out;) but for that you must wholly and



<P>solely have recourse to, and make stay upon his doctrine that



<P>is your Teacher after the first order.&nbsp; Yea, Mr. Recorder



<P>himself must not look for life from that which he himself



<P>revealeth; his dependence for that must be founded in the



<P>doctrine of the other preacher.&nbsp; Let Mr. Recorder also take



<P>heed that he receive not any doctrine, or point of doctrine,



<P>that is not communicated to him by his Superior Teacher, nor



<P>yet within the precincts of his own formal knowledge.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, after the Prince had thus settled things in the famous



<P>town of Mansoul, he proceeded to give to the elders of the



<P>corporation a necessary caution, to wit, how they should



<P>carry it to the high and noble captains that he had, from his



<P>Father's court, sent or brought with him, to the famous town



<P>of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'These captains,' said he, 'do love the town of Mansoul, and



<P>they are picked men, picked out of abundance, as men that



<P>best suit, and that will most faithfully serve in the wars of



<P>Shaddai against the Diabolonians, for the preservation of the



<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; 'I charge you therefore,' said he, 'O ye



<P>inhabitants of the now flourishing town of Mansoul, that you



<P>carry it not ruggedly or untowardly to my captains, or their



<P>men; since, as I said, they are picked and choice men - men



<P>chosen out of many for the good of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; I



<P>say, I charge you, that you carry it not untowardly to them:



<P>for though they have the hearts and faces of lions, when at



<P>any time they shall be called forth to engage and fight with



<P>the King's foes, and the enemies of the town of Mansoul; yet



<P>a little discountenance cast upon them from the town of



<P>Mansoul will deject and cast down their faces, will weaken



<P>and take away their courage.&nbsp; Do not, therefore, O my



<P>beloved, carry it unkindly to my valiant captains and



<P>courageous men of war, but love them, nourish them, succour



<P>them, and lay them in your bosoms; and they will not only



<P>fight for you, but cause to fly from you all those the



<P>Diabolonians that seek, and will, if possible, be, your utter



<P>destruction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'If, therefore, any of them should at any time be sick or



<P>weak, and so not able to perform that office of love, which,



<P>with all their hearts, they are willing to do (and will do



<P>also when well and in health), slight them not, nor despise



<P>them, but rather strengthen them and encourage them, though



<P>weak and ready to die, for they are your fence, and your



<P>guard, your wall, your gates, your locks, and your bars.&nbsp; And



<P>although, when they are weak, they can do but little, but



<P>rather need to be helped by you, than that you should then



<P>expect great things from them, yet, when well, you know what



<P>exploits, what feats and warlike achievements they are able



<P>to do, and will perform for you.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Besides, if they be weak, the town of Mansoul cannot be



<P>strong; if they be strong, then Mansoul cannot be weak; your



<P>safety, therefore, doth lie in their health, and in your



<P>countenancing them.&nbsp; Remember, also, that if they be sick,



<P>they catch that disease of the town of Mansoul itself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'These things I have said unto you because I love your



<P>welfare and your honour: observe, therefore, O my Mansoul, to



<P>be punctual in all things that I have given in charge unto



<P>you, and that not only as a town corporate, and so to your



<P>officers and guard, and guides in chief, but to you as you



<P>are a people whose well-being, as single persons, depends on



<P>the observation of the orders and commandments of their Lord.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Next, O my Mansoul, I do warn you of that, of which,



<P>notwithstanding that reformation that at present is wrought



<P>among you, you have need to be warned about: wherefore



<P>hearken diligently unto me.&nbsp; I am now sure, and you will know



<P>hereafter, that there are yet of the Diabolonians remaining



<P>in the town of Mansoul, Diabolonians that are sturdy and



<P>implacable, and that do already while I am with you, and that



<P>will yet more when I am from you, study, plot, contrive,



<P>invent, and jointly attempt to bring you to desolation, and



<P>so to a state far worse than that of the Egyptian bondage;



<P>they are the avowed friends of Diabolus, therefore look about



<P>you.&nbsp; They used heretofore to lodge with their Prince in the



<P>Castle, when Incredulity was the Lord Mayor of this town; but



<P>since my coming hither, they lie more in the outsides and



<P>walls, and have made themselves dens, and caves, and holes,



<P>and strongholds therein.&nbsp; Wherefore, O Mansoul! thy work, as



<P>to this, will be so much the more difficult and hard; that



<P>is, to take, mortify, and put them to death according to the



<P>will of my Father.&nbsp; Nor can you utterly rid yourselves of



<P>them, unless you should pull down the walls of your town, the



<P>which I am by no means willing you should.&nbsp; Do you ask me,



<P>What shall we do then?&nbsp; Why, be you diligent, and quit you



<P>like men; observe their holes; find out their haunts; assault



<P>them, and make no peace with them.&nbsp; Wherever they haunt,



<P>lurk, or abide, and what terms of peace soever they offer



<P>you, abhor, and all shall be well betwixt you and me.&nbsp; And



<P>that you may the better know them from those that are the



<P>natives of Mansoul, I will give you this brief schedule of



<P>the names of the chief of them; and they are these that



<P>follow:- The Lord Fornication, the Lord Adultery, the Lord



<P>Murder, the Lord Anger, the Lord Lasciviousness, the Lord



<P>Deceit, the Lord Evil-Eye, Mr. Drunkenness, Mr. Revelling,



<P>Mr. Idolatry, Mr. Witch-craft, Mr. Variance, Mr. Emulation,



<P>Mr. Wrath, Mr. Strife, Mr. Sedition, and Mr. Heresy.&nbsp; These



<P>are some of the chief, O Mansoul! of those that will seek to



<P>overthrow thee for ever.&nbsp; These, I say, are the skulkers in



<P>Mansoul; but look thou well into the law of thy King, and



<P>there thou shalt find their physiognomy, and such other



<P>characteristical notes of them, by which they certainly may



<P>be known.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'These, O my Mansoul, (and I would gladly that you should



<P>certainly know it,) if they be suffered to run and range



<P>about the town as they would, will quickly, like vipers, eat



<P>out your bowels; yea, poison your captains, cut the sinews of



<P>your soldiers, break the bars and bolts of your gates, and



<P>turn your now most flourishing Mansoul into a barren and



<P>desolate wilderness, and ruinous heap.&nbsp; Wherefore, that you



<P>may take courage to yourselves to apprehend these villains



<P>wherever you find them, I give to you, my Lord Mayor, my Lord



<P>Willbewill, and Mr. Recorder, with all the inhabitants of the



<P>town of Mansoul, full power and commission to seek out, to



<P>take, and to cause to be put to death by the cross, all, and



<P>all manner of Diabolonians, when and wherever you shall find



<P>them to lurk within, or to range without the walls of the



<P>town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I told you before that I had placed a standing ministry



<P>among you; not that you have but these with you, for my first



<P>four captains who came against the master and lord of the



<P>Diabolonians that was in Mansoul, they can, and if need be,



<P>and if they be required, will not only privately inform, but



<P>publicly preach to the corporation both good and wholesome



<P>doctrine, and such as shall lead you in the way.&nbsp; Yea, they



<P>will set up a weekly, yea, if need be, a daily lecture in



<P>thee, O Mansoul! and will instruct thee in such profitable



<P>lessons, that, if heeded, will do thee good at the end.&nbsp; And



<P>take good heed that you spare not the men that you have a



<P>commission to take and crucify.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Now, as I have set before your eyes the vagrants and



<P>runagates by name, so I will tell you, that among yourselves,



<P>some of them shall creep in to beguile you, even such as



<P>would seem, and that in appearance are, very rife and hot for



<P>religion.&nbsp; And they, if you watch not, will do you a



<P>mischief, such an one as at present you cannot think of.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'These, as I said, will show themselves to you in another hue



<P>than those under description before.&nbsp; Wherefore, Mansoul,



<P>watch and be sober, and suffer not thyself to be betrayed.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the Prince had thus far new modelled the town of



<P>Mansoul, and had instructed them in such matters as were



<P>profitable for them to know, then he appointed another day in



<P>which he intended, when the townsfolk came together, to



<P>bestow a further badge of honour upon the town of Mansoul, -



<P>a badge that should distinguish them from all the people,



<P>kindreds, and tongues that dwell in the kingdom of Universe.



<P>Now it was not long before the day appointed was come, and



<P>the Prince and his people met in the King's palace, where



<P>first Emmanuel made a short speech unto them, and then did



<P>for them as he had said, and unto them as he had promised.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'My Mansoul,' said he, 'that which I now am about to do, is



<P>to make you known to the world to be mine, and to distinguish



<P>you also in your own eyes, from all false traitors that may



<P>creep in among you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then he commanded that those that waited upon him should go



<P>and bring forth out of his treasury those white and



<P>glistening robes 'that I,' said he, 'have provided and laid



<P>up in store for my Mansoul.'&nbsp; So the white garments were



<P>fetched out of his treasury, and laid forth to the eyes of



<P>the people.&nbsp; Moreover, it was granted to them that they



<P>should take them and put them on, 'according,' said he, 'to



<P>your size and stature.'&nbsp; So the people were put into white,



<P>into fine linen, white and clean.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Prince unto them, 'This, O Mansoul, is my



<P>livery, and the badge by which mine are known from the



<P>servants of others.&nbsp; Yea, it is that which I grant to all



<P>that are mine, and without which no man is permitted to see



<P>my face.&nbsp; Wear them, therefore, for my sake, who gave them



<P>unto you; and also if you would be known by the world to be



<P>mine.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But now! can you think how Mansoul shone?&nbsp; It was fair as the



<P>sun, clear as the moon, and terrible as an army with banners.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Prince added further, and said, 'No prince, potentate, or



<P>mighty one of Universe, giveth this livery but myself:



<P>behold, therefore, as I said before, you shall be known by it



<P>to be mine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And now,' said he, 'I have given you my livery, let me give



<P>you also in commandment concerning them; and be sure that you



<P>take good heed to my words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'First.&nbsp; Wear them daily, day by day, lest you should at



<P>sometimes appear to others as if you were none of mine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Second.&nbsp; Keep them always white; for if they be soiled, it



<P>is dishonour to me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Third.&nbsp; Wherefore gird them up from the ground, and let them



<P>not lag with dust and dirt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Fourth.&nbsp; Take heed that you lose them not, lest you walk



<P>naked, and they see your shame.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Fifth.&nbsp; But if you should sully them, if you should defile



<P>them, the which I am greatly unwilling you should, and the



<P>prince Diabolus will be glad if you would, then speed you to



<P>do that which is written in my law, that yet you may stand,



<P>and befall before me, and before my throne.&nbsp; Also, this is



<P>the way to cause that I may not leave you, nor forsake you



<P>while here, but may dwell in this town of Mansoul for ever.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And now was Mansoul, and the inhabitants of it, as the signet



<P>upon Emmanuel's right hand.&nbsp; Where was there now a town, a



<P>city, a corporation, that could compare with Mansoul! a town



<P>redeemed from the hand, and from the power of Diabolus! a



<P>town that the King Shaddai loved, and that he sent Emmanuel



<P>to regain from the Prince of the infernal cave; yea, a town



<P>that Emmanuel loved to dwell in, and that he chose for his



<P>royal habitation; a town that he fortified for himself, and



<P>made strong by the force of his army.&nbsp; What shall I say,



<P>Mansoul has now a most excellent Prince, golden captains and



<P>men of war, weapons proved, and garments as white as snow.



<P>Nor are these benefits to be counted little, but great; can



<P>the town of Mansoul esteem them so, and improve them to that



<P>end and purpose for which they are bestowed upon them?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the Prince had thus completed the modelling of the town,



<P>to show that he had great delight in the work of his hands



<P>and took pleasure in the good that he had wrought for the



<P>famous and flourishing Mansoul, he commanded, and they set



<P>his standard upon the battlements of the castle.&nbsp; And then,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>First.&nbsp; He gave them frequent visits; not a day now but the



<P>elders of Mansoul must come to him, or he to them, into his



<P>palace.&nbsp; Now they must walk and talk together of all the



<P>great things that he had done, and yet further promised to



<P>do, for the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Thus would he often do with the



<P>Lord Mayor, my Lord Willbewill, and the honest subordinate



<P>preacher Mr. Conscience, and Mr. Recorder.&nbsp; But oh, how



<P>graciously, how lovingly, how courteously, and tenderly did



<P>this blessed Prince now carry it towards the town of Mansoul!



<P>In all the streets, gardens, orchards, and other places where



<P>he came, to be sure the poor should have his blessing and



<P>benediction; yea, he would kiss them, and if they were ill he



<P>would lay hands on them, and make them well.&nbsp; The captains,



<P>also, he would daily, yea, sometimes hourly, encourage with



<P>his presence and goodly words.&nbsp; For you must know that a



<P>smile from him upon them would put more vigour, more life,



<P>and stoutness into them, than would anything else under



<P>heaven.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Prince would now also feast them, and be with them



<P>continually: hardly a week would pass but a banquet must be



<P>had betwixt him and them.&nbsp; You may remember that, some pages



<P>before, we make mention of one feast that they had together;



<P>but now to feast them was a thing more common: every day with



<P>Mansoul was a feast-day now.&nbsp; Nor did he, when they returned



<P>to their places, send them empty away, either they must have



<P>a ring, a gold chain, a bracelet, a white stone, or



<P>something; so dear was Mansoul to him now; so lovely was



<P>Mansoul in his eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Second.&nbsp; When the elders and townsmen did not come to him, he



<P>would send in much plenty of provision unto them; meat that



<P>came from court, wine and bread that were prepared for his



<P>Father's table; yea, such delicates would he send unto them,



<P>and therewith would so cover their table, that whoever saw it



<P>confessed that the like could not be seen in any kingdom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Third.&nbsp; If Mansoul did not frequently visit him as he desired



<P>they should, he would walk out to them, knock at their doors,



<P>and desire entrance, that amity might be maintained betwixt



<P>them and him; if they did hear and open to him, as commonly



<P>they would, if they were at home, then would he renew his



<P>former love, and confirm it too with some new tokens, and



<P>signs of continued favour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And was it not now amazing to behold, that in that very place



<P>where sometimes Diabolus had his abode, and entertained his



<P>Diabolonians to the almost utter destruction of Mansoul, the



<P>Prince of princes should sit eating and drinking with them,



<P>while all his mighty captains, men of war, trumpeters, with



<P>the singing-men and singing-women of his Father, stood round



<P>about to wait upon them!&nbsp; Now did Mansoul's cup run over, now



<P>did her conduits run sweet wine, now did she eat the finest



<P>of the wheat, and drink milk and honey out of the rock!&nbsp; Now,



<P>she said, How great is his goodness! for since I found favour



<P>in his eyes, how honourable have I been!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The blessed Prince did also ordain a new officer in the town,



<P>and a goodly person he was; his name was Mr. God's-Peace:



<P>this man was set over my Lord Willbewill, my Lord Mayor, Mr.



<P>Recorder, the subordinate preacher, Mr. Mind, and over all



<P>the natives of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Himself was not a native



<P>of it, but came with the Prince Emmanuel from the court.&nbsp; He



<P>was a great acquaintance of Captain Credence and Captain



<P>Good-Hope; some say they were kin, and I am of that opinion



<P>too.&nbsp; This man, as I said, was made governor of the town in



<P>general, especially over the castle, and Captain Credence was



<P>to help him there.&nbsp; And I made great observation of it, that



<P>so long as all things went in Mansoul as this sweet-natured



<P>gentleman would, the town was in most happy condition.&nbsp; Now



<P>there were no jars, no chiding, no interferings, no



<P>unfaithful doings in all the town of Mansoul; every man in



<P>Mansoul kept close to his own employment.&nbsp; The gentry, the



<P>officers, the soldiers, and all in place observed their



<P>order.&nbsp; And as for the women and children of the town, they



<P>followed their business joyfully; they would work and sing,



<P>work and sing, from morning till night: so that quite through



<P>the town of Mansoul now nothing was to be found but harmony,



<P>quietness, joy, and health.&nbsp; And this lasted all that summer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But there was a man in the town of Mansoul, and his name was



<P>Mr. Carnal-Security; this man did, after all this mercy



<P>bestowed on this corporation, bring the town of Mansoul into



<P>great and grievous slavery and bondage.&nbsp; A brief account of



<P>him and of his doings take as followeth:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Diabolus at first took possession of the town of



<P>Mansoul, he brought thither, with himself, a great number of



<P>Diabolonians, men of his own conditions.&nbsp; Now among these



<P>there was one whose name was Mr. Self-Conceit, and a notable



<P>brisk man he was, as any that in those days did possess the



<P>town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Diabolus, then, perceiving this man to be



<P>active and bold, sent him upon many desperate designs, the



<P>which he managed better, and more to the pleasing of his



<P>lord, than most that came with him from the dens could do.



<P>Wherefore, finding him so fit for his purpose, he preferred



<P>him, and made him next to the great Lord Willbewill, of whom



<P>we have written so much before.&nbsp; Now the Lord Willbewill



<P>being in those days very well pleased with him, and with his



<P>achievements, gave him his daughter, the Lady Fear-Nothing,



<P>to wife.&nbsp; Now, of my Lady Fear-nothing, did this Mr. Self-



<P>Conceit beget this gentleman, Mr. Carnal-Security.



<P>Wherefore, there being then in Mansoul those strange kinds of



<P>mixtures, it was hard for them, in some cases, to find out



<P>who were natives, who not, for Mr. Carnal-Security sprang



<P>from my Lord Willbewill by mother's side, though he had for



<P>his father a Diabolonian by nature.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, this Carnal-Security took much after his father and



<P>mother; he was self-conceited, he feared nothing, he was also



<P>a very busy man: nothing of news, nothing of doctrine,



<P>nothing of alteration, or talk of alteration, could at any



<P>time be on foot in Mansoul, but be sure Mr. Carnal-Security



<P>would be at the head or tail of it: but, to be sure, he would



<P>decline those that he deemed the weakest, and stood always



<P>with them in his way of standing, that he supposed was the



<P>strongest side.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when Shaddai the mighty, and Emmanuel his Son, made war



<P>upon Mansoul, to take it, this Mr. Carnal-Security was then



<P>in town, and was a great doer among the people, encouraging



<P>them in their rebellion, putting them upon hardening



<P>themselves in their resisting the King's forces: but when he



<P>saw that the town of Mansoul was taken, and converted to the



<P>use of the glorious Prince Emmanuel; and when he also saw



<P>what was become of Diabolus, and how he was unroosted, and



<P>made to quit the castle in the greatest contempt and scorn;



<P>and that the town of Mansoul was well lined with captains,



<P>engines of war, and men, and also provision; what doth he but



<P>slyly wheel about also; and as he had served Diabolus against



<P>the good Prince, so he feigned that he would serve the Prince



<P>against his foes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And having got some little smattering of Emmanuel's things by



<P>the end, being bold, he ventures himself into the company of



<P>the townsmen, any attempts also to chat among them.&nbsp; Now he



<P>knew that the power and strength of the town of Mansoul was



<P>great, and that it could not but be pleasing to the people,



<P>if he cried up their might and their glory.&nbsp; Wherefore he



<P>beginneth his tale with the power and strength of Mansoul,



<P>and affirmed that it was impregnable; now magnifying their



<P>captains and their slings, and their rams; then crying up



<P>their fortifications and strongholds; and, lastly, the



<P>assurances that they had from their Prince, that Mansoul



<P>should be happy for ever.&nbsp; But when he saw that some of the



<P>men of the town were tickled and taken with his discourse, he



<P>makes it his business, and walking from street to street,



<P>house to house, and man to man, he at last brought Mansoul to



<P>dance after his pipe, and to grow almost as carnally secure



<P>as himself; so from talking they went to feasting, and from



<P>feasting to sporting; and so to some other matters.&nbsp; Now



<P>Emmanuel was yet in the town of Mansoul, and he wisely



<P>observed their doings.&nbsp; My Lord Mayor, my Lord Willbewill,



<P>and Mr. Recorder were also all taken with the words of this



<P>tattling Diabolonian gentleman, forgetting that their Prince



<P>had given them warning before to take heed that they were not



<P>beguiled with any Diabolonian sleight; he had further told



<P>them that the security of the now flourishing town of Mansoul



<P>did not so much lie in her present fortifications and force,



<P>as in her so using of what she had, as might oblige her



<P>Emmanuel to abide within her castle.&nbsp; For the right doctrine



<P>of Emmanuel was, that the town of Mansoul should take heed



<P>that they forgot not his Father's love and his; also, that



<P>they should so demean themselves as to continue to keep



<P>themselves therein.&nbsp; Now this was not the way to do it,



<P>namely, to fall in love with one of the Diabolonians, and



<P>with such an one too as Mr. Carnal-Security was, and to be



<P>led up and down by the nose by him; they should have heard



<P>their Prince, feared their Prince, loved their Prince, and



<P>have stoned this naughty pack to death, and took care to have



<P>walked in the ways of their Prince's prescribing: for then



<P>should their peace have been as a river, when their



<P>righteousness had been like the waves of the sea.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>But when the petition was drawn up, By whom should they send



<P>it? was the next question; for they would not send this by



<P>him by whom they sent the first, for they thought that the



<P>Prince had taken some offence at the manner of his deportment



<P>before him: so they attempted to make Captain Conviction



<P>their messenger with it; but he said that he neither durst



<P>nor would petition Emmanuel for traitors, nor be to the



<P>Prince an advocate for rebels.&nbsp; 'Yet withal,' said he, 'our



<P>Prince is good, and you may adventure to send it by the hand



<P>of one of your town, provided he went with a rope about his



<P>head, and pleaded nothing but mercy.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, they made, through fear, their delays as long as they



<P>could, and longer than delays were good; but fearing at last



<P>the dangerousness of them, they thought, but with many a



<P>fainting in their minds, to send their petition by Mr.



<P>Desires-awake; so they sent for Mr. Desires-awake.&nbsp; Now he



<P>dwelt in a very mean cottage in Mansoul, and he came at his



<P>neighbour's request.&nbsp; So they told him what they had done,



<P>and what they would do, concerning petitioning, and that they



<P>did desire of him that he would go therewith to the Prince.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Mr. Desires-awake, 'Why should not I do the best I



<P>can to save so famous a town as Mansoul from deserved



<P>destruction?'&nbsp; They therefore delivered the petition to him,



<P>and told him how he must address himself to the Prince, and



<P>wished him ten thousand good speeds.&nbsp; So he comes to the



<P>Prince's pavilion, as the first, and asked to speak with his



<P>Majesty.&nbsp; So word was carried to Emmanuel, and the Prince



<P>came out to the man.&nbsp; When Mr. Desires-awake saw the Prince,



<P>he fell flat with his face to the ground, and cried out, 'Oh



<P>that Mansoul might live before thee!' and with that he



<P>presented the petition; the which when the Prince had read,



<P>he turned away for a while and wept; but refraining himself,



<P>he turned again to the man, who all this while lay crying at



<P>his feet, as at the first, and said to him, 'Go thy way to



<P>thy place, and I will consider of thy requests.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, you may think that they of Mansoul that had sent him,



<P>what with guilt, and what with fear lest their petition



<P>should be rejected, could not but look with many a long look,



<P>and that, too, with strange workings of heart, to see what



<P>would become of their petition.&nbsp; At last they saw their



<P>messenger coming back.&nbsp; So, when he was come, they asked him



<P>how he fared, what Emmanuel said, and what was become of the



<P>petition.&nbsp; But he told them that he would be silent till he



<P>came to the prison to my Lord Mayor, my Lord Willbewill, and



<P>Mr. Recorder.&nbsp; So he went forwards towards the prison-house,



<P>where the men of Mansoul lay bound.&nbsp; But, oh! what a



<P>multitude flocked after, to hear what the messenger said.



<P>So, when he was come, and had shown himself at the gate of



<P>the prison, my Lord Mayor himself looked as white as a clout;



<P>the Recorder also did quake.&nbsp; But they asked and said, 'Come,



<P>good sir, what did the great Prince say to you?'&nbsp; Then said



<P>Mr. Desires-awake, 'When I came to my Lord's pavilion, I



<P>called, and he came forth.&nbsp; So I fell prostrate at his feet,



<P>and delivered to him my petition; for the greatness of his



<P>person, and the glory of his countenance, would not suffer me



<P>to stand upon my legs.&nbsp; Now, as he received the petition, I



<P>cried, "Oh that Mansoul might live before thee!"&nbsp; So, when



<P>for a while he had looked thereon, he turned him about, and



<P>said to his servant, "Go thy way to thy place again, and I



<P>will consider of thy requests."'&nbsp; The messenger added,



<P>moreover, and said, 'The Prince to whom you sent me is such a



<P>one for beauty and glory, that whoso sees him must both love



<P>and fear him.&nbsp; I, for my part, can do no less; but I know not



<P>what will be the end of these things.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At this answer they were all at a stand, both they in prison,



<P>and they that followed the messenger thither to hear the



<P>news; nor knew they what, or what manner of interpretation to



<P>put upon what the Prince had said.&nbsp; Now, when the prison was



<P>cleared of the throng, the prisoners among themselves began



<P>to comment upon Emmanuel's words.&nbsp; My Lord Mayor said, that



<P>the answer did not look with a rugged face; but Willbewill



<P>said that it betokened evil; and the Recorder, that it was a



<P>messenger of death.&nbsp; Now, they that were left, and that stood



<P>behind, and so could not so well hear what the prisoners



<P>said, some of them catched hold of one piece of a sentence,



<P>and some on a bit of another; some took hold of what the



<P>messenger said, and some of the prisoners' judgment thereon;



<P>so none had the right understanding of things.&nbsp; But you



<P>cannot imagine what work these people made, and what a



<P>confusion there was in Mansoul now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For presently they that had heard what was said flew about



<P>the town, one crying one thing, and another the quite



<P>contrary; and both were sure enough they told true; for they



<P>did hear, they said, with their ears what was said, and



<P>therefore could not be deceived.&nbsp; One would say, 'We must all



<P>be killed;' another would say, 'We must all be saved;' and a



<P>third would say that the Prince would not be concerned with



<P>Mansoul; and a fourth, that the prisoners must be suddenly



<P>put to death.&nbsp; And, as I said, every one stood to it that he



<P>told his tale the rightest, and that all others but he were



<P>out.&nbsp; Wherefore Mansoul had now molestation upon molestation,



<P>nor could any man know on what to rest the sole of his foot;



<P>for one would go by now, and as he went, if he heard his



<P>neighbour tell his tale, to be sure he would tell the quite



<P>contrary, and both would stand in it that he told the truth.



<P>Nay, some of them had got this story by the end, that the



<P>Prince did intend to put Mansoul to the sword.&nbsp; And now it



<P>began to be dark, wherefore poor Mansoul was in sad



<P>perplexity all that night until the morning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But, so far as I could gather by the best information that I



<P>could get, all this hubbub came through the words that the



<P>Recorder said when he told them that, in his judgment, the



<P>Prince's answer was a messenger of death.&nbsp; It was this that



<P>fired the town, and that began the fright in Mansoul; for



<P>Mansoul in former times did use to count that Mr. Recorder



<P>was a seer, and that his sentence was equal to the best of



<P>orators; and thus was Mansoul a terror to itself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And now did they begin to feel what were the effects of



<P>stubborn rebellion, and unlawful resistance against their



<P>Prince.&nbsp; I say, they now began to feel the effects thereof by



<P>guilt and fear, that now had swallowed them up; and who more



<P>involved in the one but they that were most in the other, to



<P>wit, the chief of the town of Mansoul?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To be brief: when the fame of the fright was out of the town,



<P>and the prisoners had a little recovered themselves, they



<P>take to themselves some heart, and think to petition the



<P>Prince for life again.&nbsp; So they did draw up a third petition,



<P>the contents whereof were these:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Prince Emmanuel the Great, Lord of all worlds, and Master of



<P>mercy, we, thy poor, wretched, miserable, dying town of



<P>Mansoul, do confess unto thy great and glorious Majesty that



<P>we have sinned against thy Father and thee, and are no more



<P>worthy to be called thy Mansoul, but rather to be cast into



<P>the pit.&nbsp; If thou wilt slay us, we have deserved it.&nbsp; If thou



<P>wilt condemn us to the deep, we cannot but say thou art



<P>righteous.&nbsp; We cannot complain whatever thou dost, or however



<P>thou carriest it towards us.&nbsp; But, oh! let mercy reign, and



<P>let it be extended to us!&nbsp; Oh! let mercy take hold upon us,



<P>and free us from our transgressions, and we will sing of thy



<P>mercy and of thy judgment.&nbsp; Amen.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This petition, when drawn up, was designed to be sent to the



<P>Prince as the first.&nbsp; But who should carry it? - that was the



<P>question.&nbsp; Some said, 'Let him do it that went with the



<P>first,' but others thought not good to do that, and that



<P>because he sped no better.&nbsp; Now, there was an old man in the



<P>town, and his name was Mr. Good-Deed; a man that bare only



<P>the name, but had nothing of the nature of the thing.&nbsp; Now,



<P>some were for sending him; but the Recorder was by no means



<P>for that.&nbsp; 'For,' said he, 'we now stand in need of, and are



<P>pleading for mercy: wherefore, to send our petition by a man



<P>of this name, will seem to cross the petition itself.&nbsp; Should



<P>we make Mr. Good-Deed our messenger, when our petition cries



<P>for mercy?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Besides,' quoth the old gentleman, 'should the Prince now,



<P>as he receives the petition, ask him, and say, "What is thy



<P>name?" as nobody knows but he will, and he should say, "Old



<P>Good-Deed," what, think you, would Emmanuel say but this?



<P>"Ay! is old Good-Deed yet alive in Mansoul? then let old



<P>Good-Deed save you from your distresses."&nbsp; And if he says so,



<P>I am sure we are lost; nor can a thousand of old Good-Deeds



<P>save Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After the Recorder had given in his reasons why old Good-Deed



<P>should not go with this petition to Emmanuel, the rest of the



<P>prisoners and chief of Mansoul opposed it also, and so old



<P>Good-Deed was laid aside, and they agreed to send Mr.



<P>Desires-awake again.&nbsp; So they sent for him, and desired him



<P>that he would a second time go with their petition to the



<P>Prince, and he readily told them he would.&nbsp; But they bid him



<P>that in anywise he should take heed that in no word or



<P>carriage he gave offence to the Prince; 'For by doing so, for



<P>ought we can tell, you may bring Mansoul into utter



<P>destruction,' said they.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now Mr. Desires-awake, when he saw that he must go on this



<P>errand, besought that they would grant that Mr. Wet-Eyes



<P>might go with him.&nbsp; Now this Mr. Wet-Eyes was a near



<P>neighbour of Mr. Desires, a poor man, a man of a broken



<P>spirit, yet one that could speak well to a petition; so they



<P>granted that he should go with him.&nbsp; Wherefore, they address



<P>themselves to their business: Mr. Desires put a rope upon his



<P>head, and Mr. Wet-Eyes went with his hands wringing together.



<P>Thus they went to the Prince's pavilion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when they went to petition this third time, they were



<P>not without thoughts that, by often coming, they might be a



<P>burden to the Prince.&nbsp; Wherefore, when they were come to the



<P>door of his pavilion, they first made their apology for



<P>themselves, and for their coming to trouble Emmanuel so



<P>often; and they said, that they came not hither to-day for



<P>that they delighted in being troublesome, or for that they



<P>delighted to hear themselves talk, but for that necessity



<P>caused them to come to his Majesty.&nbsp; They could, they said,



<P>have no rest day nor night because of their transgressions



<P>against Shaddai and against Emmanuel, his Son.&nbsp; They also



<P>thought that some misbehaviour of Mr. Desires-awake the last



<P>time might give distaste to his Highness, and so cause that



<P>he returned from so merciful a Prince empty, and without



<P>countenance.&nbsp; So, when they had made this apology, Mr.



<P>Desires-awake cast himself prostrate upon the ground, as at



<P>the first, at the feet of the mighty Prince, saying, 'Oh!



<P>that Mansoul might live before thee!' and so he delivered his



<P>petition.&nbsp; The Prince then, having read the petition, turned



<P>aside awhile as before, and coming again to the place where



<P>the petitioner lay on the ground, he demanded what his name



<P>was, and of what esteem in the account of Mansoul, for that



<P>he, above all the multitude in Mansoul, should be sent to him



<P>upon such an errand.&nbsp; Then said the man to the Prince, 'Oh



<P>let not my Lord be angry; and why inquirest thou after the



<P>name of such a dead do - as I am?&nbsp; Pass by, I pray thee, and



<P>take not notice of who I am, because there is, as thou very



<P>well knowest, so great a disproportion between me and thee.



<P>Why the townsmen chose to send me on this errand to my Lord



<P>is best known to themselves, but it could not be for that



<P>they thought that I had favour with my Lord.&nbsp; For my part, I



<P>am out of charity with myself; who, then, should be in love



<P>with me?&nbsp; Yet live I would, and so would I that my townsmen



<P>should; and because both they and myself are guilty of great



<P>transgressions, therefore they have sent me, and I am come in



<P>their names to beg of my Lord for mercy.&nbsp; Let it please thee,



<P>therefore, to incline to mercy; but ask not what thy servants



<P>are.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Prince, 'And what is he that is become thy



<P>companion in this so weighty a matter?'&nbsp; So Mr. Desires told



<P>Emmanuel that he was a poor neighbour of his, and one of his



<P>most intimate associates.&nbsp; 'And his name,' said he, 'may it



<P>please your most excellent Majesty, is Wet-Eyes, of the town



<P>of Mansoul, I know that there are many of that name that are



<P>naught; but I hope it will be no offence to my Lord that I



<P>have brought my poor neighbour with me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then Mr. Wet-Eyes fell on his face to the ground, and made



<P>this apology for his coming with his neighbour to his Lord:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'O, my Lord,' quoth he, 'what I am I know not myself, nor



<P>whether my name be feigned or true, especially when I begin



<P>to think what some have said, namely, That this name was



<P>given me because Mr. Repentance was my father.&nbsp; Good men have



<P>bad children, and the sincere do oftentimes beget hypocrites.



<P>My mother also called me by this name from the cradle; but



<P>whether because of the moistness of my brain, or because of



<P>the softness of my heart, I cannot tell.&nbsp; I see dirt in mine



<P>own tears, and filthiness in the bottom of my prayers.&nbsp; But I



<P>pray thee (and all this while the gentleman wept) that thou



<P>wouldest not remember against us our transgressions, nor take



<P>offence at the unqualifiedness of thy servants, but



<P>mercifully pass by the sin of Mansoul, and refrain from the



<P>glorifying of thy grace no longer.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So at his bidding they arose, and both stood trembling before



<P>him, and he spake to them to this purpose:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The town of Mansoul hath grievously rebelled against my



<P>Father, in that they have rejected him from being their King,



<P>and did choose to themselves for their captain a liar, a



<P>murderer, and a runagate slave.&nbsp; For this Diabolus, your



<P>pretended prince, though once so highly accounted of by you,



<P>made rebellion against my Father and me, even in our palace



<P>and highest court there, thinking to become a prince and



<P>king.&nbsp; But being there timely discovered and apprehended, and



<P>for his wickedness bound in chains, and separated to the pit



<P>with those that were his companions, he offered himself to



<P>you, and you have received him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Now this is, and for a long time hath been, a high affront



<P>to my Father; wherefore my Father sent to you a powerful army



<P>to reduce you to your obedience.&nbsp; But you know how these men,



<P>their captains and their counsels, were esteemed of you, and



<P>what they received at your hand.&nbsp; You rebelled against them,



<P>you shut your gates upon them, you bid them battle, you



<P>fought them, and fought for Diabolus against them.&nbsp; So they



<P>sent to my Father for more power, and I, with my men, are



<P>come to subdue you.&nbsp; But as you treated the servants, so you



<P>treated their Lord.&nbsp; You stood up in hostile manner against



<P>me, you shut up your gates against me, you turned the deaf



<P>ear to me, and resisted as long as you could; but now I have



<P>made a conquest of you.&nbsp; Did you cry me mercy so long as you



<P>had hopes that you might prevail against me?&nbsp; But now I have



<P>taken the town, you cry; but why did you not cry before, when



<P>the white flag of my mercy, the red flag of justice, and the



<P>black flag that threatened execution, were set up to cite you



<P>to it?&nbsp; Now I have conquered your Diabolus, you come to me



<P>for favour; but why did you not help me against the mighty?



<P>Yet I will consider your petition, and will answer it so as



<P>will be for my glory.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Go, bid Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction bring the



<P>prisoners out to me into the camp to-morrow, and say you to



<P>Captain Judgment and Captain Execution, "Stay you in the



<P>castle, and take good heed to yourselves that you keep all



<P>quiet in Mansoul until you shall hear further from me."'&nbsp; And



<P>with that he turned himself from them, and went into his



<P>royal pavilion again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So the petitioners, having received this answer from the



<P>Prince, returned, as at the first, to go to their companions



<P>again.&nbsp; But they had not gone far, but thoughts began to work



<P>in their minds that no mercy as yet was intended by the



<P>Prince to Mansoul.&nbsp; So they went to the place where the



<P>prisoners lay bound; but these workings of mind about what



<P>would become of Mansoul had such strong power over them, that



<P>by that they were come unto them that sent them, they were



<P>scarce able to deliver their message.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But they came at length to the gates of the town, (now the



<P>townsmen with earnestness were waiting for their return,)



<P>where many met them, to know what answer was made to the



<P>petition.&nbsp; Then they cried out to those that were sent, 'What



<P>news from the Prince? and what hath Emmanuel said?'&nbsp; But they



<P>said that they must, as afore, go up to the prison, and there



<P>deliver their message.&nbsp; So away they went to the prison, with



<P>a multitude at their heels.&nbsp; Now, when they were come to the



<P>gates of the prison, they told the first part of Emmanuel's



<P>speech to the prisoners, to wit, how he reflected upon their



<P>disloyalty to his Father and himself, and how they had chosen



<P>and closed with Diabolus, had fought for him, hearkened to



<P>him, and been ruled by him; but had despised him and his men.



<P>This made the prisoners look pale; but the messengers



<P>proceeded and said, 'He, the Prince, said, moreover, that yet



<P>he would consider your petition, and give such answer thereto



<P>as would stand with his glory.'&nbsp; And as these words were



<P>spoken, Mr. Wet-Eyes gave a great sigh.&nbsp; At this they were



<P>all of them struck into their dumps, and could not tell what



<P>to say: fear also possessed them in a marvellous manner, and



<P>death seemed to sit upon some of their eyebrows.&nbsp; Now, there



<P>was in the company a notable, sharp-witted fellow, a mean man



<P>of estate, and his name was old Inquisitive.&nbsp; This man asked



<P>the petitioners if they had told out every whit of what



<P>Emmanuel said, and they answered, 'Verily, no.'&nbsp; Then said



<P>Inquisitive, 'I thought so, indeed.&nbsp; Pray, what was it more



<P>that he said unto you?'&nbsp; Then they paused awhile; but at last



<P>they brought out all, saying, 'The Prince bade us bid Captain



<P>Boanerges and Captain Conviction bring the prisoners down to



<P>him to-morrow; and that Captain Judgment and Captain



<P>Execution should take charge of the castle and town till they



<P>should hear further from him.&nbsp; They said also that when the



<P>Prince had commanded them thus to do, he immediately turned



<P>his back upon them, and went into his royal pavilion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But, oh! how this return, and specially this last clause of



<P>it, that the prisoners must go out to the Prince into the



<P>camp, brake all their loins in pieces!&nbsp; Wherefore, with one



<P>voice they set up a cry that reached up to the heavens.&nbsp; This



<P>done, each of the three prepared himself to die; (and the



<P>Recorder said unto them, 'This was the thing that I feared;')



<P>for they concluded that to-morrow, by that the sun went down,



<P>they should be tumbled out of the world.&nbsp; The whole town also



<P>counted of no other, but that, in their time and order, they



<P>must all drink of the same cup.&nbsp; Wherefore the town of



<P>Mansoul spent that night in mourning, and sackcloth and



<P>ashes.&nbsp; The prisoners also, when the time was come for them



<P>to go down before the Prince, dressed themselves in mourning



<P>attire, with ropes upon their heads.&nbsp; The whole town of



<P>Mansoul also showed themselves upon the wall, all clad in



<P>mourning weeds, if, perhaps, the Prince with the sight



<P>thereof might be moved with compassion.&nbsp; But, oh! how the



<P>busy-bodies that were in the town of Mansoul did now concern



<P>themselves!&nbsp; They did run here and there through the streets



<P>of the town by companies, crying out as they ran in



<P>tumultuous wise, one after one manner, and another the quite



<P>contrary, to the almost utter distraction of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, the time is come that the prisoners must go down to the



<P>camp, and appear before the Prince.&nbsp; And thus was the manner



<P>of their going down: Captain Boanerges went with a guard



<P>before them, and Captain Conviction came behind, and the



<P>prisoners went down, bound in chains, in the midst.&nbsp; So I



<P>say, the prisoners went in the midst, and the guard went with



<P>flying colours behind and before, but the prisoners went with



<P>drooping spirits.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Or, more particularly, thus: The prisoners went down all in



<P>mourning: they put ropes upon themselves; they went on,



<P>smiting themselves on the breasts, but durst not lift up



<P>their eyes to heaven.&nbsp; Thus they went out at the gate of



<P>Mansoul, till they came into the midst of the Prince's army,



<P>the sight and glory of which did greatly heighten their



<P>affliction.&nbsp; Nor could they now longer forbear, but cry out



<P>aloud, 'O unhappy men!&nbsp; O wretched men of Mansoul!'&nbsp; Their



<P>chains, still mixing their dolorous notes with the cries of



<P>the prisoners, made the noise more lamentable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So, when they were come to the door of the Prince's pavilion,



<P>they cast themselves prostrate upon the place; then one went



<P>in and told his Lord that the prisoners were come down.&nbsp; The



<P>Prince then ascended a throne of state, and sent for the



<P>prisoners in; who, when they came, did tremble before him,



<P>also they covered their faces with shame.&nbsp; Now, as they drew



<P>near to the place where he sat, they threw themselves down



<P>before him.&nbsp; Then said the Prince to the Captain Boanerges,



<P>'Bid the prisoners stand upon their feet.'&nbsp; Then they stood



<P>trembling before him, and he said, 'Are you the men that



<P>heretofore were the servants of Shaddai?'&nbsp; And they said,



<P>'Yes, Lord, yes.'&nbsp; Then said the Prince again, 'Are you the



<P>men that did suffer yourselves to be corrupted and defiled by



<P>that abominable one, Diabolus?'&nbsp; And they said, 'We did more



<P>than suffer it, Lord; for we chose it of our own mind.'&nbsp; The



<P>Prince asked further, saying, 'Could you have been content



<P>that your slavery should have continued under his tyranny as



<P>long as you had lived?'&nbsp; Then said the prisoners, 'Yes, Lord,



<P>yes; for his ways were pleasing to our flesh, and we were



<P>grown aliens to a better state.' - 'And did you,' said he,



<P>'when I came up against this town of Mansoul, heartily wish



<P>that I might not have the victory over you?' - 'Yes, Lord,



<P>yes,' said they.&nbsp; Then said the Prince, 'And what punishment



<P>is it, think you, that you deserve at my hand, for these and



<P>other your high and mighty sins?' - And they said, 'Both



<P>death and the deep, Lord; for we have deserved no less.'&nbsp; He



<P>asked again if they had aught to say for themselves why the



<P>sentence, that they confessed that they had deserved, should



<P>not be passed upon them?&nbsp; And they said, 'We can say nothing,



<P>Lord: thou art just, for we have sinned.'&nbsp; Then said the



<P>Prince, 'And for what are those ropes on your heads?'&nbsp; The



<P>prisoners answered, 'These ropes are to bind us withal to the



<P>place of execution, if mercy be not pleasing in thy sight.'



<P>So he further asked if all the men in the town of Mansoul



<P>were in this confession, as they?&nbsp; And they answered, 'All



<P>the natives, Lord; but for the Diabolonians that came into



<P>our town when the tyrant got possession of us, we can say



<P>nothing for them.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then the Prince commanded that a herald should be called, and



<P>that he should, in the midst and throughout the camp of



<P>Emmanuel, proclaim, and that with sound of trumpet, that the



<P>Prince, the Son of Shaddai, had, in his Father's name, and



<P>for his Father's glory, gotten a perfect conquest and victory



<P>over Mansoul; and that the prisoners should follow him, and



<P>say Amen.&nbsp; So, this was done as he had commanded.&nbsp; And



<P>presently the music that was in the upper region sounded



<P>melodiously, the captains that were in the camp shouted, and



<P>the soldiers did sing songs of triumph to the Prince; the



<P>colours waved in the wind, and great joy was everywhere, only



<P>it was wanting as yet in the hearts of the men of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then the Prince called for the prisoners to come and to stand



<P>again before him, and they came and stood trembling.&nbsp; And he



<P>said unto them, 'The sins, trespasses, iniquities, that you,



<P>with the whole town of Mansoul, have from time to time



<P>committed against my Father and me, I have power and



<P>commandment from my Father to forgive to the town of Mansoul,



<P>and do forgive you accordingly.'&nbsp; And having so said, he gave



<P>them, written in parchment, and sealed with seven seals, a



<P>large and general pardon, commanding my Lord Mayor, my Lord



<P>Willbewill, and Mr. Recorder, to proclaim and cause it to be



<P>proclaimed to-morrow, by that the sun is up, throughout the



<P>whole town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Moreover, the Prince stripped the prisoners of their mourning



<P>weeds, and gave them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for



<P>mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of



<P>heaviness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then he gave to each of the three jewels of gold and precious



<P>stones, and took away their ropes, and put chains of gold



<P>about their necks, and ear-rings in their ears.&nbsp; Now, the



<P>prisoners, when they did hear the gracious words of Prince



<P>Emmanuel, and had beheld all that was done unto them, fainted



<P>almost quite away; for the grace, the benefit, the pardon,



<P>was sudden, glorious, and so big, that they were not able,



<P>without staggering, to stand up under it.&nbsp; Yea, my Lord



<P>Willbewill swooned outright; but the Prince stepped to him,



<P>put his everlasting arms under him, embraced him, kissed him,



<P>and bid him be of good cheer, for all should be performed



<P>according to his word.&nbsp; He also did kiss, and embrace, and



<P>smile upon the other two that were Willbewill's companions,



<P>saying, 'Take these as further tokens of my love, favour, and



<P>compassions to you; and I charge you that you, Mr. Recorder,



<P>tell in the town of Mansoul what you have heard and seen.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then were their fetters broken to pieces before their faces,



<P>and cast into the air, and their steps were enlarged under



<P>them.&nbsp; Then they fell down at the feet of the Prince, and



<P>kissed his feet, and wetted them with tears: also they cried



<P>out with a mighty strong voice, saying, 'Blessed be the glory



<P>of the Lord from this place.'&nbsp; So they were bid rise up, and



<P>go to the town, and tell to Mansoul what the Prince had done.



<P>He commanded also that one with a pipe and tabor should go



<P>and play before them all the way into the town of Mansoul.



<P>Then was fulfilled what they never looked for, and they were



<P>made to possess that which they never dreamed of.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Prince also called for the noble Captain Credence, and



<P>commanded that he and some of his officers should march



<P>before the noble men of Mansoul with flying colours into the



<P>town.&nbsp; He gave also unto Captain Credence a charge, that



<P>about that time that the Recorder did read the general pardon



<P>in the town of Mansoul, that at that very time he should with



<P>flying colours march in at Eye-gate with his ten thousands at



<P>his feet and that he should so go until he came by the high



<P>street of the town, up to the castle gates, and that himself



<P>should take possession thereof against his Lord came thither.



<P>He commanded, moreover, that he should bid Captain Judgment



<P>and Captain Execution to leave the stronghold to him, and to



<P>withdraw from Mansoul, and to return into the camp with speed



<P>unto the Prince.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And now was the town of Mansoul also delivered from the



<P>terror of the first four captains and their men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, I told you before how the prisoners were entertained by



<P>the noble Prince Emmanuel, and how they behaved themselves



<P>before him, and how he sent them away to their home with pipe



<P>and tabor going before them.&nbsp; And now you must think that



<P>those of the town that had all this while waited to hear of



<P>their death, could not but be exercised with sadness of mind,



<P>and with thoughts that pricked like thorns.&nbsp; Nor could their



<P>thoughts be kept to any one point; the wind blew with them



<P>all this while at great uncertainties; yea, their hearts were



<P>like a balance that had been disquieted with a shaking hand.



<P>But at last, as they with many a long look looked over the



<P>wall of Mansoul, they thought that they saw some returning to



<P>the town; and thought again, Who should they be, too?&nbsp; Who



<P>should they be?&nbsp; At last they discerned that they were the



<P>prisoners: but can you imagine how their hearts were



<P>surprised with wonder, specially when they perceived also in



<P>what equipage and with what honour they were sent home.&nbsp; They



<P>went down to the camp in black, but they came back to the



<P>town in white; they went down to the camp in ropes, they came



<P>back in chains of gold; they went down to the camp with their



<P>feet in fetters, but came back with their steps enlarged



<P>under them; they went also to the camp looking for death, but



<P>they came back from thence with assurance of life; they went



<P>down to the camp with heavy hearts, but came back again with



<P>pipe and tabor playing before them.&nbsp; So as soon as they were



<P>come to Eye-gate, the poor and tottering town of Mansoul



<P>adventured to give a shout; and they gave such a shout as



<P>made the captains in the Prince's army leap at the sound



<P>thereof.&nbsp; Alas! for them, poor hearts! who could blame them?



<P>since their dead friends were come to life again; for it was



<P>to them as life from the dead to see the ancients of the town



<P>of Mansoul shine in such splendour.&nbsp; They looked for nothing



<P>but the axe and the block; but, behold, joy and gladness,



<P>comfort and consolation, and such melodious notes attending



<P>them that was sufficient to make a sick man well.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So, when they came up, they saluted each other with,



<P>'Welcome, welcome! and blessed be he that has spared you!'



<P>They added also, 'We see it is well with you; but how must it



<P>go with the town of Mansoul?&nbsp; And will it go well with the



<P>town of Mansoul?' said they.&nbsp; Then answered them the Recorder



<P>and my Lord Mayor, 'Oh! tidings! glad tidings! good tidings



<P>of good, and of great joy to poor Mansoul!'&nbsp; Then they gave



<P>another shout, that made the earth to ring again.&nbsp; After



<P>this, they inquired yet more particularly how things went in



<P>the camp, and what message they had from Emmanuel to the



<P>town.&nbsp; So they told them all passages that had happened to



<P>them at the camp, and everything that the Prince did to them.



<P>This made Mansoul wonder at the wisdom and grace of the



<P>Prince Emmanuel.&nbsp; Then they told them what they had received



<P>at his hands for the whole town of Mansoul, and the Recorder



<P>delivered it in these words: ' PARDON, PARDON, PARDON for



<P>Mansoul! and this shall Mansoul know to-morrow!'&nbsp; Then he



<P>commanded, and they went and summoned Mansoul to meet



<P>together in the market-place to-morrow, then to hear their



<P>general pardon read.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But who can think what a turn, what a change, what an



<P>alteration this hint of things did make in the countenance of



<P>the town of Mansoul!&nbsp; No man of Mansoul could sleep that



<P>night for joy; in every house there was joy and music,



<P>singing and making merry: telling and hearing of Mansoul's



<P>happiness was then all that Mansoul had to do; and this was



<P>the burden of all their song: 'Oh! more of this at the rising



<P>of the sun! more of this to-morrow!'&nbsp; 'Who thought



<P>yesterday,' would one say, 'that this day would have been



<P>such a day to us?&nbsp; And who thought, that saw our prisoners go



<P>down in irons, that they would have returned in chains of



<P>gold?&nbsp; Yea, they that judged themselves as they went to be



<P>judged of their judge, were by his mouth acquitted, not for



<P>that they were innocent, but of the Prince's mercy, and sent



<P>home with pipe and tabor.&nbsp; But is this the common custom of



<P>princes? Do they use to show such kind of favours to



<P>traitors?&nbsp; No; this is only peculiar to Shaddai, and unto



<P>Emmanuel, his Son!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now morning drew on apace; wherefore the Lord Mayor, the Lord



<P>Willbewill, and Mr. Recorder came down to the market-place at



<P>the time that the Prince had appointed, where the townsfolk



<P>were waiting for them: and when they came, they came in that



<P>attire, and in that glory that the Prince had put them into



<P>the day before, and the street was lightened with their



<P>glory.&nbsp; So the Mayor, Recorder, and my Lord Willbewill drew



<P>down to Mouth-gate, which was at the lower end of the market-



<P>place, because that of old time was the place where they used



<P>to read public matters.&nbsp; Thither, therefore, they came in



<P>their robes, and their tabrets went before them.&nbsp; Now, the



<P>eagerness of the people to know the full of the matter was



<P>great.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then the Recorder stood up upon his feet, and, first



<P>beckoning with his hand for silence, he read out with a loud



<P>voice the pardon.&nbsp; But when he came to these words: 'The



<P>Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, pardoning



<P>iniquity, transgressions, and sins, and to them all manner of



<P>sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven,' etc., they could not



<P>forbear leaping for joy.&nbsp; For this you must know, that there



<P>was conjoined herewith every man's name in Mansoul; also the



<P>seals of the pardon made a brave show.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the Recorder had made an end of reading the pardon, the



<P>townsmen ran up upon the walls of the town, and leaped and



<P>skipped thereon for joy, and bowed themselves seven times



<P>with their faces toward Emmanuel's pavilion, and shouted out



<P>aloud for joy, and said, 'Let Emmanuel live for ever!'&nbsp; Then



<P>order was given to the young men in Mansoul that they should



<P>ring the bells for joy.&nbsp; So the bells did ring, and the



<P>people sing, and the music go in every house in Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the Prince had sent home the three prisoners of Mansoul



<P>with joy, and pipe and tabor, he commanded his captains, with



<P>all the field officers and soldiers throughout his army, to



<P>be ready in that morning, that the Recorder should read the



<P>pardon in Mansoul, to do his further pleasure.&nbsp; So the



<P>morning, as I have showed, being come, just as the Recorder



<P>had made an end of reading the pardon, Emmanuel commanded



<P>that all the trumpets in the camp should sound, that the



<P>colours should be displayed, half of them upon Mount



<P>Gracious, and half of them upon Mount Justice.&nbsp; He commanded



<P>also that all the captains should show themselves in all



<P>their harness, and that the soldiers should shout for joy.



<P>Nor was Captain Credence, though in the castle, silent in



<P>such a day; but he, from the top of the hold, showed himself



<P>with sound of trumpet to Mansoul and to the Prince's camp.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thus have I showed you the manner and way that Emmanuel took



<P>to recover the town of Mansoul from under the hand and power



<P>of the tyrant Diabolus.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when the Prince had completed these, the outward



<P>ceremonies of his joy, he again commanded that his captains



<P>and soldiers should show unto Mansoul some feats of war: so



<P>they presently addressed themselves to this work.&nbsp; But oh!



<P>with what agility, nimbleness, dexterity, and bravery did



<P>these military men discover their skill in feats of war to



<P>the now gazing town of Mansoul!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They marched, they counter-marched; they opened to the right



<P>and left; they divided and subdivided; they closed, they



<P>wheeled, made good their front and rear with their right and



<P>left wings, and twenty things more, with that aptness, and



<P>then were all as the were again, that they took - yea,



<P>ravished, the hearts that were in Mansoul to behold it.&nbsp; But



<P>add to this, the handling of their arms, the managing of



<P>their weapons of war, were marvellously taking to Mansoul and



<P>me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When this action was over, the whole town of Mansoul came out



<P>as one man to the Prince in the camp to thank him, and praise



<P>him for his abundant favour, and to beg that it would please



<P>his grace to come unto Mansoul with his men, and there to



<P>take up their quarters for ever: and this they did in most



<P>humble manner, bowing themselves seven times to the ground



<P>before him.&nbsp; Then said he, 'All peace be to you.' So the town



<P>came nigh, and touched with the hand the top of his golden



<P>sceptre; and they said, 'Oh! that the Prince Emmanuel, with



<P>his captains and men of war, would dwell in Mansoul for ever;



<P>and that his battering-rams and slings might be lodged in her



<P>for the use and service of the Prince, and for the help and



<P>strength of Mansoul.&nbsp; For,' said they, 'we have room for



<P>thee, we have room for thy men, we have also room for thy



<P>weapons of war, and a place to make a magazine for thy



<P>carriages.&nbsp; Do it, Emmanuel, and thou shalt be King and



<P>Captain in Mansoul for ever.&nbsp; Yea, govern thou also according



<P>to all the desire of thy soul, and make thou governors and



<P>princes under thee of thy captains and men of war, and we



<P>will become thy servants, and thy laws shall be our



<P>direction.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They added, moreover, and prayed his Majesty to consider



<P>thereof; 'for,' said they, 'if now, after all this grace



<P>bestowed upon us, thy miserable town of Mansoul, thou



<P>shouldest withdraw, thou and thy captains, from us, the town



<P>of Mansoul will die.&nbsp; Yea,' said they, 'our blessed Emmanuel,



<P>if thou shouldest depart from us now, now thou hast done so



<P>much good for us, and showed so much mercy unto us, what will



<P>follow but that our joy will be as if it had not been, and



<P>our enemies will a second time come upon us with more rage



<P>than at the first?&nbsp; Wherefore, we beseech thee, O thou, the



<P>desire of our eyes, and the strength and life of our poor



<P>town, accept of this motion that now we have made unto our



<P>Lord, and come and dwell in the midst of us, and let us be



<P>thy people.&nbsp; Besides, Lord, we do not know but that to this



<P>day many Diabolonians may be yet lurking in the town of



<P>Mansoul, and they will betray us, when thou shalt leave us,



<P>into the hand of Diabolus again; and who knows what designs,



<P>plots, or contrivances have passed betwixt them about these



<P>things already?&nbsp; Loath we are to fall again into his horrible



<P>hands.&nbsp; Wherefore, let it please thee to accept of our palace



<P>for thy place of residence, and of the houses of the best men



<P>in our town for the reception of thy soldiers and their



<P>furniture.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Prince, 'If I come to your town, will you



<P>suffer me further to prosecute that which is in mine heart



<P>against mine enemies and yours? - yea, will you help me in



<P>such undertakings?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They answered, 'We know not what we shall do; we did not



<P>think once that we should have been such traitors to Shaddai



<P>as we have proved to be.&nbsp; What, then, shall we say to our



<P>Lord?&nbsp; Let him put no trust in his saints; let the Prince



<P>dwell in our castle, and make of our town a garrison; let him



<P>set his noble captains and his warlike soldiers over us; yea,



<P>let him conquer us with his love, and overcome us with his



<P>grace, and then surely shall he be but with us, and help us,



<P>as he was and did that morning that our pardon was read unto



<P>us.&nbsp; We shall comply with this our Lord, and with his ways,



<P>and fall in with his word against the mighty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'One word more, and thy servants have done, and in this will



<P>trouble our Lord no more.&nbsp; We know not the depth of the



<P>wisdom of thee, our Prince.&nbsp; Who could have thought, that had



<P>been ruled by his reason, that so much sweet as we do now



<P>enjoy should have come out of those bitter trials wherewith



<P>we were tried at the first!&nbsp; But, Lord, let light go before,



<P>and let love come after: yea, take us by the hand, and lead



<P>us by thy counsels, and let this always abide upon us, that



<P>all things shall be the best for thy servants, and come to



<P>our Mansoul, and do as it pleaseth thee.&nbsp; Or, Lord, come to



<P>our Mansoul, do what thou wilt, so thou keepest us from



<P>sinning, and makest us serviceable to thy Majesty.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Prince to the town of Mansoul again, 'Go,



<P>return to your houses in peace.&nbsp; I will willingly in this



<P>comply with your desires; I will remove my royal pavilion, I



<P>will draw up my forces before Eye-gate to-morrow, and so will



<P>march forwards into the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; I will possess



<P>myself of your castle of Mansoul, and will set my soldiers



<P>over you: yea, I will yet do things in Mansoul that cannot be



<P>paralleled in any nation, country, or kingdom under heaven.'



<P>Then did the men of Mansoul give a shout, and returned unto



<P>their houses in peace; they also told to their kindred and



<P>friends the good that Emmanuel had promised to Mansoul.&nbsp; 'And



<P>to-morrow,' said they, 'he will march into our town, and take



<P>up his dwelling, he and his men, in Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then went out the inhabitants of the town of Mansoul with



<P>haste to the green trees and to the meadows, to gather boughs



<P>and flowers, therewith to strew the streets against their



<P>Prince, the Son of Shaddai, should come; they also made



<P>garlands and other fine works to betoken how joyful they



<P>were, and should be to receive their Emmanuel into Mansoul;



<P>yea, they strewed the street quite from Eye-gate to the



<P>castle-gate, the place where the Prince should be.&nbsp; They also



<P>prepared for his coming what music the town of Mansoul would



<P>afford, that they might play before him to the palace, his



<P>habitation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So, at the time appointed he makes his approach to Mansoul,



<P>and the gates were set open for him; there also the ancients



<P>and elders of Mansoul met him to salute him with a thousand



<P>welcomes.&nbsp; Then he arose and entered Mansoul, he and all his



<P>servants.&nbsp; The elders of Mansoul did also go dancing before



<P>him till he came to the castle gates.&nbsp; And this was the



<P>manner of his going up thither:- He was clad in his golden



<P>armour, he rode in his royal chariot, the trumpets sounded



<P>about him, the colours were displayed, his ten thousands went



<P>up at his feet, and the elders of Mansoul danced before him.



<P>And now were the walls of the famous town of Mansoul filled



<P>with the tramplings of the inhabitants thereof, who went up



<P>thither to view the approach of the blessed Prince and his



<P>royal army.&nbsp; Also the casements, windows, balconies, and tops



<P>of the houses, were all now filled with persons of all sorts,



<P>to behold how their town was to be filled with good.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when he was come so far into the town as to the



<P>Recorder's house, he commanded that one should go to Captain



<P>Credence, to know whether the castle of Mansoul was prepared



<P>to entertain his royal presence (for the preparation of that



<P>was left to that captain), and word was brought that it was.



<P>Then was Captain Credence commanded also to come forth with



<P>his power to meet the Prince, the which was, as he had



<P>commanded, done; and he conducted him into the castle.&nbsp; This



<P>done, the Prince that night did lodge in the castle with his



<P>mighty captains and men of war, to the joy of the town of



<P>Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, the next care of the townsfolk was, how the captains and



<P>soldiers of the Prince's army should be quartered among them;



<P>and the care was not how they should shut their hands of



<P>them, but how they should fill their houses with them; for



<P>every man in Mansoul now had that esteem of Emmanuel and his



<P>men that nothing grieved them more than because they were not



<P>enlarged enough, every one of them to receive the whole army



<P>of the Prince; yea, they counted it their glory to be waiting



<P>upon them, and would, in those days, run at their bidding



<P>like lackeys.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last they came to this result:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1. That Captain Innocency should quarter at Mr. Reason's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2. That Captain Patience should quarter at Mr. Mind's.&nbsp; This



<P>Mr. Mind was formerly the Lord Willbewill's clerk in time of



<P>the late rebellion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3. It was ordered that Captain Charity should quarter at Mr.



<P>Affection's house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>4. That Captain Good-Hope should quarter at my Lord Mayor's.



<P>Now, for the house of the Recorder, himself desired, because



<P>his house was next to the castle, and because from him it was



<P>ordered by the Prince that, if need be, the alarm should be



<P>given to Mansoul, - it was, I say, desired by him that



<P>Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction should take up their



<P>quarters with him, even they and all their men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>5. As for Captain Judgment and Captain Execution, my Lord



<P>Willbewill took them and their men to him, because he was to



<P>rule under the Prince for the good of the town of Mansoul



<P>now, as he had before under the tyrant Diabolus for the hurt



<P>and damage thereof.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>6. And throughout the rest of the town were quartered



<P>Emmanuel's forces; but Captain Credence, with his men, abode



<P>still in the castle.&nbsp; So the Prince, his captains, and his



<P>soldiers, were lodged in the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, the ancients and elders of the town of Mansoul thought



<P>that they never should have enough of the Prince Emmanuel;



<P>his person, his actions, his words, and behaviour, were so



<P>pleasing, so taking, so desirable to them.&nbsp; Wherefore they



<P>prayed him, that though the castle of Mansoul was his place



<P>of residence, (and they desired that he might dwell there for



<P>ever,) yet that he would often visit the streets, houses, and



<P>people of Mansoul.&nbsp; 'For,' said they, 'dread Sovereign, thy



<P>presence, thy looks, thy smiles, thy words, are the life, and



<P>strength, and sinews of the town of Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Besides this, they craved that they might have, without



<P>difficulty or interruption, continual access unto him, (so



<P>for that very purpose he commanded that the gates should



<P>stand open,) that they might there see the manner of his



<P>doings, the fortifications of the place, and the royal



<P>mansion-house of the Prince.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he spake, they all stopped their mouths and gave



<P>audience; and when he walked, it was their delight to imitate



<P>him in his goings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, upon a time, Emmanuel made a feast for the town of



<P>Mansoul; and upon the feasting-day the townsfolk were come to



<P>the castle to partake of his banquet; and he feasted them



<P>with all manner of outlandish food; - food that grew not in



<P>the fields of Mansoul; nor in all the whole Kingdom of



<P>Universe; it was food that came from his Father's court.&nbsp; And



<P>so there was dish after dish set before them, and they were



<P>commanded freely to eat.&nbsp; But still, when a fresh dish was



<P>set before them, they would whisperingly say to each other,



<P>'What is it?' for they wist not what to call it.&nbsp; They drank



<P>also of the water that was made wine, and were very merry



<P>with him.&nbsp; There was music also all the while at the table;



<P>and man did eat angels' food, and had honey given him out of



<P>the rock.&nbsp; So Mansoul did eat the food that was peculiar to



<P>the court; yea, they had now thereof to the full.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I must not forget to tell you, that as at this table there



<P>were musicians, so they were not those of the country, nor



<P>yet of the town of Mansoul; but they were the masters of the



<P>songs that were sung at the court of Shaddai.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, after the feast was over, Emmanuel was for entertaining



<P>the town of Mansoul with some curious riddles of secrets



<P>drawn up by his Father's secretary, by the skill and wisdom



<P>of Shaddai; the like to these there is not in any kingdom.



<P>These riddles were made upon the King Shaddai himself, and



<P>upon Emmanuel his Son, and upon his wars and doings with



<P>Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emmanuel also expounded unto them some of those riddles



<P>himself; but, oh! how they were lightened!&nbsp; They saw what



<P>they never saw; they could not have thought that such



<P>rarities could have been couched in so few and such ordinary



<P>words.&nbsp; I told you before, whom these riddles did concern;



<P>and as they were opened, the people did evidently see it was



<P>so.&nbsp; Yea, they did gather that the things themselves were a



<P>kind of a portraiture, and that of Emmanuel himself; for when



<P>they read in the scheme where the riddles were writ, and



<P>looked in the face of the Prince, things looked so like the



<P>one to the other, that Mansoul could not forbear but say,



<P>'This is the lamb! this is the sacrifice! this is the rock!



<P>this is the red cow! this is the door! and this is the way!'



<P>with a great many other things more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And thus he dismissed the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; But can you



<P>imagine how the people of the corporation were taken with



<P>this entertainment!&nbsp; Oh! they were transported with joy, they



<P>were drowned with wonderment, while they saw and understood,



<P>and considered what their Emmanuel entertained them withal,



<P>and what mysteries he opened to them.&nbsp; And when they were at



<P>home in their houses, and in their most retired places, they



<P>could not but sing of him and of his actions.&nbsp; Yea, so taken



<P>were the townsmen now with their Prince, that they would sing



<P>of him in their sleep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, it was in the heart of the Prince Emmanuel to new-model



<P>the town of Mansoul, and to put it into such a condition as



<P>might be most pleasing to him, and that might best stand with



<P>the profit and security of the now flourishing town of



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; He provided also against insurrections at home, and



<P>invasions from abroad, such love had he for the famous town



<P>of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wherefore he first of all commanded that the great slings



<P>that were brought from his Father's court, when he came to



<P>the war of Mansoul, should be mounted, some upon the



<P>battlements of the castle, some upon the towers; for there



<P>were towers in the town of Mansoul, towers, new-built by



<P>Emmanuel since he came hither.&nbsp; There was also an instrument,



<P>invented by Emmanuel, that was to throw stones from the



<P>castle of Mansoul, out at Mouth-gate; an instrument that



<P>could not be resisted, nor that would miss of execution.



<P>Wherefore, for the wonderful exploits that it did when used,



<P>it went without a name; and it was committed to the care of,



<P>and to be managed by the brave captain, the Captain Credence,



<P>in case of war.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This done, Emmanuel called the Lord Willbewill to him, and



<P>gave him in commandment to take care of the gates, the wall,



<P>and towers in Mansoul; also the Prince gave him the militia



<P>into his hand, and a special charge to withstand all



<P>insurrections and tumults that might be made in Mansoul



<P>against the peace of our Lord the King, and the peace and



<P>tranquillity of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; He also gave him in



<P>commission, that if he found any of the Diabolonians lurking



<P>in any corner of the famous town of Mansoul, he should



<P>forthwith apprehend them, and stay them, or commit them to



<P>safe custody, that they may be proceeded against according to



<P>law.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then he called unto him the Lord Understanding, who was the



<P>old Lord Mayor, he that was put out of place when Diabolus



<P>took the town, and put him into his former office again, and



<P>it became his place for his lifetime.&nbsp; He bid him also that



<P>he should build him a palace near Eye-gate; and that he



<P>should build it in fashion like a tower for defence.&nbsp; He bid



<P>him also that he should read in the Revelation of Mysteries



<P>all the days of his life, that he might know how to perform



<P>his office aright.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He also made Mr. Knowledge the Recorder, not of contempt to



<P>old Mr. Conscience, who had been Recorder before, but for



<P>that it was in his princely mind to confer upon Mr.



<P>Conscience another employ, of which he told the old gentleman



<P>he should know more hereafter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then he commanded that the image of Diabolus should be taken



<P>down from the place where it was set up, and that they should



<P>destroy it utterly, beating it into powder, and casting it



<P>into the wind without the town wall; and that the image of



<P>Shaddai, his Father, should be set up again, with his own,



<P>upon the castle gates; and that it should be more fairly



<P>drawn than ever, forasmuch as both his Father and himself



<P>were come to Mansoul in more grace and mercy than heretofore.



<P>He would also that his name should be fairly engraven upon



<P>the front of the town, and that it should be done in the best



<P>of gold, for the honour of the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After this was done, Emmanuel gave out a commandment that



<P>those three great Diabolonians should be apprehended, namely,



<P>the two late Lord Mayors, to wit, Mr. Incredulity, Mr.



<P>Lustings, and Mr. Forget-Good, the Recorder.&nbsp; Besides these,



<P>there were some of them that Diabolus made burgesses and



<P>aldermen in Mansoul, that were committed to ward by the hand



<P>of the now valiant and now right noble, the brave Lord



<P>Willbewill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And these were their names: Alderman Atheism, Alderman Hard-



<P>Heart, and Alderman False-Peace.&nbsp; The burgesses were, Mr. No-



<P>Truth, Mr. Pitiless, Mr. Haughty, with the like.&nbsp; These were



<P>committed to close custody, and the gaoler's name was Mr.



<P>True-Man.&nbsp; This True-Man was one of those that Emmanuel



<P>brought with him from his Father's court when at the first he



<P>made a war upon Diabolus in the town or Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After this, the Prince gave a charge that the three



<P>strongholds that, at the command of Diabolus, the



<P>Diabolonians built in Mansoul, should be demolished and



<P>utterly pulled down; of which holds and their names, with



<P>their captains and governors, you read a little before.&nbsp; But



<P>this was long in doing, because of the largeness of the



<P>places, and because the stones, the timber, the iron, and all



<P>rubbish, was to be carried without the town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When this was done, the Prince gave order that the Lord Mayor



<P>and aldermen of Mansoul should call a court of judicature for



<P>the trial and execution of the Diabolonians in the



<P>corporation now under the charge of Mr. True-Man, the gaoler.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when the time was come, and the court set, commandment



<P>was sent to Mr. True-Man, the gaoler, to bring the prisoners



<P>down to the bar.&nbsp; Then were the prisoners brought down,



<P>pinioned and chained together, as the custom of the town of



<P>Mansoul was.&nbsp; So, when they were presented before the Lord



<P>Mayor, the Recorder, and the rest of the honourable bench,



<P>first, the jury was empannelled, and then the witnesses



<P>sworn.&nbsp; The names of the jury were these: Mr. Belief, Mr.



<P>True-Heart, Mr. Upright, Mr. Hate-Bad, Mr. Love-God, Mr. See-



<P>Truth, Mr. Heavenly-Mind, Mr. Moderate, Mr. Thankful, Mr.



<P>Good-Work, Mr. Zeal-for-God, and Mr. Humble.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The names of the witnesses were - Mr. Know-All, Mr. Tell-



<P>True, Mr. Hate-Lies, with my Lord Willbewill and his man, if



<P>need were.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So the prisoners were set to the bar.&nbsp; Then said Mr. Do-



<P>Right, (for he was the Town-Clerk,) 'Set Atheism to the bar,



<P>gaoler.'&nbsp; So he was set to the bar.&nbsp; Then said the Clerk,



<P>'Atheism, hold up thy hand.&nbsp; Thou art here indicted by the



<P>name of Atheism, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for



<P>that thou hast perniciously and doltishly taught and



<P>maintained that there is no God, and so no heed to be taken



<P>to religion.&nbsp; This thou hast done against the being, honour,



<P>and glory of the King, and against the peace and safety of



<P>the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; What sayest thou?&nbsp; Art thou guilty of



<P>this indictment, or not?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>ATHEISM.&nbsp; Not guilty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CRIER.&nbsp; Call Mr. Know-All, Mr. Tell-True, and Mr. Hate-Lies



<P>into the court.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So they were called, and they appeared.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Clerk, 'You, the witnesses for the King, look



<P>upon the prisoner at the bar; do you know him?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Mr. Know-All, 'Yes, my lord, we know him; his name



<P>is Atheism; he has been a very pestilent fellow for many



<P>years in the miserable town of Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; You are sure you know him?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>KNOW.&nbsp; Know him!&nbsp; Yes my lord; I have heretofore too often



<P>been in his company to be at this time ignorant of him.&nbsp; He



<P>is a Diabolonian, the son of a Diabolonian: I knew his



<P>grandfather and his father.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Well said.&nbsp; He standeth here indicted by the name

of



<P>Atheism, etc., and is charged that he hath maintained and



<P>taught that there is no God, and so no heed need be taken to



<P>any religion.&nbsp; What say you, the King's witnesses, to this?



<P>Is he guilty or not?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>KNOW.&nbsp; My lord, I and he were once in Villain's Lane



<P>together, and he at that time did briskly talk of divers



<P>opinions; and then and there I heard him say, that, for his



<P>part, he did believe that there was no God.&nbsp; 'But,' said he,



<P>'I can profess one, and be as religious too, if the company I



<P>am in, and the circumstances of other things,' said he,



<P>'shall put me upon it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; You are sure you heard him say thus?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>KNOW.&nbsp; Upon mine oath, I heard him say thus.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Clerk, 'Mr. Tell-True, what say you to the



<P>King's judges touching the prisoner at the bar?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TELL.&nbsp; My lord, I formerly was a great companion of his, for



<P>the which I now repent me, and I have often heard him say,



<P>and that with very great stomachfulness, that he believed



<P>there was neither God, angel, nor spirit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Where did you hear him say so?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TELL.&nbsp; In Blackmouth Lane and in Blasphemer's Row, and in



<P>many other places besides.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Have you much knowledge of him?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TELL.&nbsp; I know him to be a Diabolonian, the son of a



<P>Diabolonian, and a horrible man to deny a Deity.&nbsp; His



<P>father's name was Never-be-good, and he had more children



<P>than this Atheism.&nbsp; I have no more to say,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Hate-Lies, look upon the prisoner at the bar; do



<P>you know him?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HATE.&nbsp; My lord, this Atheism is one of the vilest wretches



<P>that ever I came near, or had to do with in my life.&nbsp; I have



<P>heard him say that there is no God; I have heard him say that



<P>there is no world to come, no sin, nor punishment hereafter,



<P>and, moreover, I have heard him say that it was as good to go



<P>to a whore-house as to go to hear a sermon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Where did you hear him say these things?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HATE.&nbsp; In Drunkard's Row, just at Rascal-Lane's End, at a



<P>house in which Mr. Impiety lived.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Set him by, gaoler, and set Mr. Lustings to the bar.



<P>Mr. Lustings, thou art here indicted by the name of Lustings,



<P>(an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for that thou hast



<P>devilishly and traitorously taught, by practice and filthy



<P>words, that it is lawful and profitable to man to give way to



<P>his carnal desires; and that thou, for thy part, hast not,



<P>nor never wilt, deny thyself of any sinful delight as long as



<P>thy name is Lustings.&nbsp; How sayest thou?&nbsp; Art thou guilty of



<P>this indictment, or not?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Mr. Lustings, 'My lord, I am a man of high birth,



<P>and have been used to pleasures and pastimes of greatness.&nbsp; I



<P>have not been wont to be snubbed for my doings, but have been



<P>left to follow my will as if it were law.&nbsp; And it seems



<P>strange to me that I should this day be called into question



<P>for that, that not only I, but almost all men, do either



<P>secretly or openly countenance, love, and approve of.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Sir, we concern not ourselves with your greatness;



<P>(though the higher, the better you should have been;) but we



<P>are concerned, and so are you now, about an indictment



<P>preferred against you.&nbsp; How say you?&nbsp; Are you guilty of it,



<P>or not?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>LUST.&nbsp; Not guilty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Crier, call upon the witnesses to stand forth and



<P>give their evidence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CRIER.&nbsp; Gentlemen, you, the witnesses for the King, come in



<P>and give in your evidence for our Lord the King against the



<P>prisoner at the bar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Come, Mr. Know-All, look upon the prisoner at the



<P>bar; do you know him?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>KNOW.&nbsp; Yes, my lord, I know him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; What is his name?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>KNOW.&nbsp; His name is Lustings; he was the son of one Beastly,



<P>and his mother bare him in Flesh Street: she was one Evil-



<P>Concupiscence's daughter.&nbsp; I knew all the generation of them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Well said.&nbsp; You have heard his indictment; what say



<P>you to it?&nbsp; Is he guilty of the things charged against him,



<P>or not?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>KNOW.&nbsp; My lord, he has, as he saith, been a great man indeed,



<P>and greater in wickedness than by pedigree more than a



<P>thousandfold.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; But what do you know of his particular actions, and



<P>especially with reference to his indictment?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>KNOW.&nbsp; I know him to be a swearer, a liar, a Sabbath-breaker;



<P>I know him to be a fornicator and an unclean person; I know



<P>him to be guilty of abundance of evils.&nbsp; He has been, to my



<P>knowledge, a very filthy man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; But where did he use to commit his wickedness? in



<P>some private corners, or more open and shamelessly?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>KNOW.&nbsp; All the town over, my lord.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Come, Mr. Tell-True, what have you to say for our



<P>Lord the King against the prisoner at the bar?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TELL.&nbsp; My lord, all that the first witness has said I know to



<P>be true, and a great deal more besides.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Lustings, do you hear what these gentlemen say?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>LUST.&nbsp; I was ever of opinion that the happiest life that a



<P>man could live on earth was to keep himself back from nothing



<P>that he desired in the world; nor have I been false at any



<P>time to this opinion of mine, but have lived in the love of



<P>my notions all my days.&nbsp; Nor was I ever so churlish, having



<P>found such sweetness in them myself, as to keep the



<P>commendations of them from others.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Court, 'There hath proceeded enough from his



<P>own mouth to lay him open to condemnation; wherefore, set him



<P>by, gaoler, and set Mr. Incredulity to the bar.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Incredulity set to the bar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Incredulity, thou art here indicted by the name



<P>of Incredulity, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for



<P>that thou hast feloniously and wickedly, and that when thou



<P>wert an officer in the town of Mansoul, made head against the



<P>captains of the great King Shaddai when they came and



<P>demanded possession of Mansoul; yea, thou didst bid defiance



<P>to the name, forces, and cause of the King, and didst also,



<P>as did Diabolus thy captain, stir up and encourage the town



<P>of Mansoul to make head against and resist the said force of



<P>the King.&nbsp; What sayest thou to this indictment?&nbsp; Art thou



<P>guilty of it, or not?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Incredulity, 'I know not Shaddai; I love my old



<P>prince; I thought it my duty to be true to my trust, and to



<P>do what I could to possess the minds of the men of Mansoul to



<P>do their utmost to resist strangers and foreigners, and with



<P>might to fight against them.&nbsp; Nor have I, nor shall I, change



<P>mine opinion for fear of trouble, though you at present are



<P>possessed of place and power.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Court, 'The man, as you see, is incorrigible;



<P>he is for maintaining his villainies by stoutness of words,



<P>and his rebellion with impudent confidence; and therefore set



<P>him by, gaoler, and set Mr. Forget-Good to the bar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Forget-Good set to the bar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CLERK.&nbsp; Mr. Forget-Good, thou art here indicted by the name



<P>of Forget-Good, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for



<P>that thou, when the whole affairs of the town of Mansoul were



<P>in thy hand, didst utterly forget to serve them in what was



<P>good, and didst fall in with the tyrant Diabolus against



<P>Shaddai the King, against his captains, and all his host, to



<P>the dishonour of Shaddai, the breach of his law, and the



<P>endangering of the destruction of the famous town of Mansoul.



<P>What sayest thou to this indictment?&nbsp; Art thou guilty or not



<P>guilty?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Forget-Good: 'Gentlemen, and at this time my



<P>judges, as to the indictment by which I stand of several



<P>crimes accused before you, pray attribute my forgetfulness to



<P>mine age, and not to my wilfulness; to the craziness of my



<P>brain, and not to the carelessness of my mind; and then I



<P>hope I may be by your charity excused from great punishment,



<P>though I be guilty.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Court, 'Forget-Good, Forget-Good, thy



<P>forgetfulness of good was not simply of frailty, but of



<P>purpose, and for that thou didst loathe to keep virtuous



<P>things in thy mind.&nbsp; What was bad thou couldst retain, but



<P>what was good thou couldst not abide to think of; thy age,



<P>therefore, and thy pretended craziness, thou makest use of to



<P>blind the court withal, and as a cloak to cover thy knavery.



<P>But let us hear what the witnesses have to say for the King



<P>against the prisoner at the bar.&nbsp; Is he guilty of this



<P>indictment, or not?'

<BR><B>A RELATION OF THE HOLY WAR.</B>

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>IN my travels, as I walked through many regions and



<P>countries, it was my chance to happen into that famous



<P>continent of Universe.&nbsp; A very large and spacious country it



<P>is: it lieth between the two poles, and just amidst the four



<P>points of the heavens.&nbsp; It is a place well watered, and



<P>richly adorned with hills and valleys, bravely situate, and



<P>for the most part, at least where I was, very fruitful, also



<P>well peopled, and a very sweet air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The people are not all of one complexion, nor yet of one



<P>language, mode, or way of religion, but differ as much as, it



<P>is said, do the planets themselves.&nbsp; Some are right, and some



<P>are wrong, even as it happeneth to be in lesser regions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In this country, as I said, it was my lot to travel; and



<P>there travel I did, and that so long, even till I learned



<P>much of their mother tongue, together with the customs and



<P>manners of them among whom I was.&nbsp; And, to speak truth, I was



<P>much delighted to see and hear many things which I saw and



<P>heard among them; yea, I had, to be sure, even lived and died



<P>a native among them, (so was I taken with them and their



<P>doings,) had not my master sent for me home to his house,



<P>there to do business for him, and to oversee business done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now there is in this gallant country of Universe a fair and



<P>delicate town, a corporation called Mansoul; a town for its



<P>building so curious, for its situation so commodious, for its



<P>privileges so advantageous, (I mean with reference to its



<P>origin,) that I may say of it, as was said before of the



<P>continent in which it is placed, There is not its equal under



<P>the whole heaven.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As to the situation of this town, it lieth just between the



<P>two worlds; and the first founder and builder of it, so far



<P>as by the best and most authentic records I can gather, was



<P>one Shaddai; and he built it for his own delight.&nbsp; He made it



<P>the mirror and glory of all that he made, even the top-piece,



<P>beyond anything else that he did in that country.&nbsp; Yea, so



<P>goodly a town was Mansoul when first built, that it is said



<P>by some, the gods, at the setting up thereof, came down to



<P>see it, and sang for joy.&nbsp; And as he made it goodly to



<P>behold, so also mighty to have dominion over all the country



<P>round about.&nbsp; Yea, all were commanded to acknowledge Mansoul



<P>for their metropolitan, all were enjoined to do homage to it.



<P>Aye, the town itself had positive commission and power from



<P>her King to demand service of all, and also to subdue any



<P>that anyways denied to do it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was reared up in the midst of this town a most famous



<P>and stately palace; for strength, it might be called a



<P>castle; for pleasantness, a paradise; for largeness, a place



<P>so copious as to contain all the world.&nbsp; This place the King



<P>Shaddai intended but for himself alone, and not another with



<P>him; partly because of his own delights, and partly because



<P>he would not that the terror of strangers should be upon the



<P>town.&nbsp; This place Shaddai made also a garrison of, but



<P>committed the keeping of it only to the men of the town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The walls of the town were well built, yea, so fast and firm



<P>were they knit and compact together, that, had it not been



<P>for the townsmen themselves, they could not have been shaken



<P>or broken for ever.&nbsp; For here lay the excellent wisdom of him



<P>that builded Mansoul, that the walls could never be broken



<P>down nor hurt by the most mighty adverse potentate, unless



<P>the townsmen gave consent thereto.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This famous town of Mansoul had five gates, in at which to



<P>come, out at which to go; and these were made likewise



<P>answerable to the walls, to wit, impregnable, and such as



<P>could never be opened nor forced but by the will and leave of



<P>those within.&nbsp; The names of the gates were these: Ear-gate,



<P>Eye-gate, Mouth-gate, Nose-gate, and Feel-gate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Other things there were that belonged to the town of Mansoul,



<P>which if you adjoin to these, will yet give farther



<P>demonstration to all, of the glory and strength of the place.



<P>It had always a sufficiency of provision within its walls; it



<P>had the best, most wholesome, and excellent law that then was



<P>extant in the world.&nbsp; There was not a rascal, rogue, or



<P>traitorous person then within its walls; they were all true



<P>men, and fast joined together; and this, you know, is a great



<P>matter.&nbsp; And to all these, it had always (so long as it had



<P>the goodness to keep true to Shaddai the King) his



<P>countenance, his protection, and it was his delight, etc.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, upon a time, there was one Diabolus, a mighty giant,



<P>made an assault upon this famous town of Mansoul, to take it,



<P>and make it his own habitation.&nbsp; This giant was king of the



<P>blacks, and a most raving prince he was.&nbsp; We will, if you



<P>please, first discourse of the origin of this Diabolus, and



<P>then of his taking of this famous town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This Diabolus is indeed a great and mighty prince, and yet



<P>both poor and beggarly.&nbsp; As to his origin, he was at first



<P>one of the servants of King Shaddai, made, and taken, and put



<P>by him into most high and mighty place; yea, was put into



<P>such principalities as belonged to the best of his



<P>territories and dominions.&nbsp; This Diabolus was made 'son of



<P>the morning,' and a brave place he had of it: it brought him



<P>much glory, and gave him much brightness, an income that



<P>might have contented his Luciferian heart, had it not been



<P>insatiable, and enlarged as hell itself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, he seeing himself thus exalted to greatness and honour,



<P>and raging in his mind for higher state and degree, what doth



<P>he but begins to think with himself how he might be set up as



<P>lord over all, and have the sole power under Shaddai.&nbsp; (Now



<P>that did the King reserve for his Son, yea, and had already



<P>bestowed it upon him.)&nbsp; Wherefore he first consults with



<P>himself what had best to be done; and then breaks his mind to



<P>some other of his companions, to the which they also agreed.



<P>So, in fine, they came to this issue that they should make an



<P>attempt upon the King's Son to destroy him, that the



<P>inheritance might be theirs.&nbsp; Well, to be short, the treason,



<P>as I said, was concluded, the time appointed, the word given,



<P>the rebels rendezvoused, and the assault attempted.&nbsp; Now the



<P>King and his Son being all and always eye, could not but



<P>discern all passages in his dominions; and he, having always



<P>love for his Son as for himself, could not at what he saw but



<P>be greatly provoked and offended: wherefore what does he, but



<P>takes them in the very nick and first trip that they made



<P>towards their design, convicts them of the treason, horrid



<P>rebellion, and conspiracy that they had devised, and now



<P>attempted to put into practice, and casts them altogether out



<P>of all place of trust, benefit, honour, and preferment.&nbsp; This



<P>done, he banishes them the court, turns them down into the



<P>horrible pits, as fast bound in chains, never more to expect



<P>the least favour from his hands, but to abide the judgment



<P>that he had appointed, and that for ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now they being thus cast out of all place of trust, profit,



<P>and honour, and also knowing that they had lost their



<P>prince's favour for ever, (being banished his court, and cast



<P>down to the horrible pits,) you may he sure they would now



<P>add to their former pride what malice and rage against



<P>Shaddai, and against his Son, they could.&nbsp; Wherefore, roving



<P>and ranging in much fury from place to place, if, perhaps,



<P>they might find something that was the King's, by spoiling of



<P>that, to revenge themselves on him; at last they happened



<P>into this spacious country of Universe, and steer their



<P>course towards the town of Mansoul; and considering that that



<P>town was one of the chief works and delights of King Shaddai,



<P>what do they but, after counsel taken, make an assault upon



<P>that.&nbsp; I say, they knew that Mansoul belonged unto Shaddai;



<P>for they were there when he built it and beautified it for



<P>himself.&nbsp; So when they had found the place, they shouted



<P>horribly for joy, and roared on it as a lion upon the prey,



<P>saying, 'Now we have found the prize, and how to be revenged



<P>on King Shaddai for what he hath done to us.'&nbsp; So they sat



<P>down and called a council of war, and considered with



<P>themselves what ways and methods they had best to engage in



<P>for the winning to themselves this famous town of Mansoul,



<P>and these four things were then propounded to be considered



<P>of.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>First.&nbsp; Whether they had best all of them to show themselves



<P>in this design to the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Secondly.&nbsp; Whether they had best to go and sit down against



<P>Mansoul in their now ragged and beggarly guise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thirdly.&nbsp; Whether they had best show to Mansoul their



<P>intentions, and what design they came about, or whether to



<P>assault it with words and ways of deceit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fourthly.&nbsp; Whether they had not best to some of their



<P>companions to give out private orders to take the advantage,



<P>if they see one or more of the principal townsmen, to shoot



<P>them, if thereby they shall judge their cause and design will



<P>the better be promoted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1. It was answered to the first of these proposals in the



<P>negative, to wit, that it would not be best that all should



<P>show themselves before the town, because the appearance of



<P>many of them might alarm and frighten the town; whereas a few



<P>or but one of them was not so likely to do it.&nbsp; And to



<P>enforce this advice to take place it was added further, that



<P>if Mansoul was frighted, or did take the alarm, 'It is



<P>impossible,' said Diabolus (for he spake now), 'that we



<P>should take the town: for that none can enter into it without



<P>its own consent.&nbsp; Let, therefore, but few, or but one,



<P>assault Mansoul; and in mine opinion,' said Diabolus, 'let me



<P>be he.'&nbsp; Wherefore to this they all agreed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2. And then to the second proposal they came, namely, Whether



<P>they had best go and sit down before Mansoul in their now



<P>ragged and beggarly guise.&nbsp; To which it was answered also in



<P>the negative, By no means; and that because, though the town



<P>of Mansoul had been made to know, and to have to do, before



<P>now, with things that are invisible, they did never as yet



<P>see any of their fellow-creatures in so sad and rascally



<P>condition as they; and this was the advice of that fierce



<P>Alecto.&nbsp; Then said Apollyon, 'The advice is pertinent; for



<P>even one of us appearing to them as we are now, must needs



<P>both beget and multiply such thoughts in them as will both



<P>put them into a consternation of spirit, and necessitate them



<P>to put themselves upon their guard.&nbsp; And if so,' said he,



<P>'then, as my Lord Diabolus said but now, it is in vain for us



<P>to think of taking the town.'&nbsp; Then said that mighty giant



<P>Beelzebub, 'The advice that already is given is safe; for



<P>though the men of Mansoul have seen such things as we once



<P>were, yet hitherto they did never behold such things as we



<P>now are; and it is best, in mine opinion, to come upon them



<P>in such a guise as is common to, and most familiar among



<P>them.'&nbsp; To this, when they had consented, the next thing to



<P>be considered was, in what shape, hue, or guise Diabolus had



<P>best to show himself when he went about to make Mansoul his



<P>own.&nbsp; Then one said one thing, and another the contrary.&nbsp;

At



<P>last Lucifer answered, that, in his opinion, it was best that



<P>his lordship should assume the body of some of those



<P>creatures that they of the town had dominion over; 'for,'



<P>quoth he, 'these are not only familiar to them, but, being



<P>under them, they will never imagine that an attempt should by



<P>them be made upon the town; and, to blind all, let him assume



<P>the body of one of those beasts that Mansoul deems to be



<P>wiser than any of the rest.'&nbsp; This advice was applauded of



<P>all: so it was determined that the giant Diabolus should



<P>assume the dragon, for that he was in those days as familiar



<P>with the town of Mansoul as now is the bird with the boy; for



<P>nothing that was in its primitive state was at all amazing to



<P>them.&nbsp; Then they proceeded to the third thing, which was:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3. Whether they had best to show their intentions, or the



<P>design of his coming, to Mansoul, or no.&nbsp; This also was



<P>answered in the negative, because of the weight that was in



<P>the former reasons, to wit, for that Mansoul were a strong



<P>people, a strong people in a strong town, whose wall and



<P>gates were impregnable, (to say nothing of their castle,) nor



<P>can they by any means be won but by their own consent.



<P>'Besides,' said Legion, (for he gave answer to this,) 'a



<P>discovery of our intentions may make them send to their king



<P>for aid; and if that be done, I know quickly what time of day



<P>it will be with us.&nbsp; Therefore let us assault them in all



<P>pretended fairness, covering our intentions with all manner



<P>of lies, flatteries, delusive words; feigning things that



<P>never will be, and promising that to them that they shall



<P>never find.&nbsp; This is the way to win Mansoul, and to make them



<P>of themselves open their gates to us; yea, and to desire us



<P>too to come in to them.&nbsp; And the reason why I think that this



<P>project will do is, because the people of Mansoul now are,



<P>every one, simple and innocent, all honest and true; nor do



<P>they as yet know what it is to be assaulted with fraud,



<P>guile, and hypocrisy.&nbsp; They are strangers to lying and



<P>dissembling lips; wherefore we cannot, if thus we be



<P>disguised, by them at all be discerned; our lies shall go for



<P>true sayings, and our dissimulations for upright dealings.



<P>What we promise them they will in that believe us, especially



<P>if, in all our lies and feigned words, we pretend great love



<P>to them, and that our design is only their advantage and



<P>honour.'&nbsp; Now there was not one bit of a reply against this;



<P>this went as current down as doth the water down a steep



<P>descent.&nbsp; Wherefore they go to consider of the last proposal,



<P>which was:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>4. Whether they had not best to give out orders to some of



<P>their company to shoot some one or more of the principal of



<P>the townsmen, if they judge that their cause may be promoted



<P>thereby.&nbsp; This was carried in the affirmative, and the man



<P>that was designed by this stratagem to be destroyed was one



<P>Mr. Resistance, otherwise called Captain Resistance.&nbsp; And a



<P>great man in Mansoul this Captain Resistance was, and a man



<P>that the giant Diabolus and his band more feared than they



<P>feared the whole town of Mansoul besides.&nbsp; Now who should be



<P>the actor to do the murder?&nbsp; That was the next, and they



<P>appointed one Tisiphone, a fury of the lake, to do it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They thus having ended their council of war, rose up, and



<P>essayed to do as they had determined; they marched towards



<P>Mansoul, but all in a manner invisible, save one, only one;



<P>nor did he approach the town in his own likeness, but under



<P>the shade and in the body of the dragon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So they drew up and sat down before Ear-gate, for that was



<P>the place of hearing for all without the town, as Eye-gate



<P>was the place of perspection.&nbsp; So, as I said, he came up with



<P>his train to the gate, and laid his ambuscado for Captain



<P>Resistance within bow-shot of the town.&nbsp; This done, the giant



<P>ascended up close to the gate, and called to the town of



<P>Mansoul for audience.&nbsp; Nor took he any with him but one Ill-



<P>pause, who was his orator in all difficult matters.&nbsp; Now, as



<P>I said, he being come up to the gate, (as the manner of those



<P>times was,) sounded his trumpet for audience; at which the



<P>chief of the town of Mansoul, such as my Lord Innocent, my



<P>Lord Willbewill, my Lord Mayor, Mr. Recorder, and Captain



<P>Resistance, came down to the wall to see who was there, and



<P>what was the matter.&nbsp; And my Lord Willbewill, when he had



<P>looked over and saw who stood at the gate, demanded what he



<P>was, wherefore he was come, and why he roused the town of



<P>Mansoul with so unusual a sound.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Diabolus, then, as if he had been a lamb, began his oration,



<P>and said: 'Gentlemen of the famous town of Mansoul, I am, as



<P>you may perceive, no far dweller from you, but near, and one



<P>that is bound by the king to do you my homage and what



<P>service I can; wherefore, that I may be faithful to myself



<P>and to you, I have somewhat of concern to impart unto you.



<P>Wherefore, grant me your audience, and hear me patiently.



<P>And first, I will assure you, it is not myself, but you - not



<P>mine, but your advantage that I seek by what I now do, as



<P>will full well be made manifest, by that I have opened my



<P>mind unto you.&nbsp; For, gentlemen, I am (to tell you the truth)



<P>come to show you how you may obtain great and ample



<P>deliverance from a bondage that, unawares to yourselves, you



<P>are captivated and enslaved under.'&nbsp; At this the town of



<P>Mansoul began to prick up its ears.&nbsp; And 'What is it?&nbsp; Pray



<P>what is it?' thought they.&nbsp; And he said, 'I have somewhat to



<P>say to you concerning your King, concerning his law, and also



<P>touching yourselves.&nbsp; Touching your King, I know he is great



<P>and potent; but yet all that he hath said to you is neither



<P>true nor yet for your advantage.&nbsp; 1. It is not true, for that



<P>wherewith he hath hitherto awed you, shall not come to pass,



<P>nor be fulfilled, though you do the thing that he hath



<P>forbidden.&nbsp; But if there was danger, what a slavery is it to



<P>live always in fear of the greatest of punishments, for doing



<P>so small and trivial a thing as eating of a little fruit is.



<P>2. Touching his laws, this I say further, they are both



<P>unreasonable, intricate, and intolerable.&nbsp; Unreasonable, as



<P>was hinted before; for that the punishment is not



<P>proportioned to the offence: there is great difference and



<P>disproportion between the life and an apple; yet the one must



<P>go for the other by the law of your Shaddai.&nbsp; But it is also



<P>intricate, in that he saith, first, you may eat of all; and



<P>yet after forbids the eating of one.&nbsp; And then, in the last



<P>place, it must needs be intolerable, forasmuch as that fruit



<P>which you are forbidden to eat of (if you are forbidden any)



<P>is that, and that alone, which is able, by your eating, to



<P>minister to you a good as yet unknown by you.&nbsp; This is



<P>manifest by the very name of the tree; it is called the "tree



<P>of knowledge of good and evil;" and have you that knowledge



<P>as yet? No, no; nor can you conceive how good, how pleasant,



<P>and how much to be desired to make one wise it is, so long as



<P>you stand by your King's commandment.&nbsp; Why should you be



<P>holden in ignorance and blindness?&nbsp; Why should you not be



<P>enlarged in knowledge and understanding?&nbsp; And now, O ye



<P>inhabitants of the famous town of Mansoul, to speak more



<P>particularly to yourselves you are not a free people!&nbsp; You



<P>are kept both in bondage and slavery, and that by a grievous



<P>threat; no reason being annexed but, "So I will have it; so



<P>it shall be."&nbsp; And is it not grievous to think on, that that



<P>very thing which you are forbidden to do might you but do it,



<P>would yield you both wisdom and honour? for then your eyes



<P>will be opened, and you shall be as gods.&nbsp; Now, since this is



<P>thus,' quoth he, 'can you be kept by any prince in more



<P>slavery and in greater bondage than you are under this day?



<P>You are made underlings, and are wrapped up in



<P>inconveniences, as I have well made appear.&nbsp; For what bondage



<P>greater than to be kept in blindness?&nbsp; Will not reason tell



<P>you that it is better to have eyes than to be without them?



<P>and so to be at liberty to be better than to be shut up in a



<P>dark and stinking cave?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And just now, while Diabolus was speaking these words to



<P>Mansoul, Tisiphone shot at Captain Resistance, where he stood



<P>on the gate, and mortally wounded him in the head; so that



<P>he, to the amazement of the townsmen, and the encouragement



<P>of Diabolus, fell down dead quite over the wall.&nbsp; Now, when



<P>Captain Resistance was dead, (and he was the only man of war



<P>in the town,) poor Mansoul was wholly left naked of courage,



<P>nor had she now any heart to resist.&nbsp; But this was as the



<P>devil would have it.&nbsp; Then stood forth he, Mr. Ill-pause,



<P>that Diabolus brought with him, who was his orator; and he



<P>addressed himself to speak to the town of Mansoul; the tenour



<P>of whose speech here follows:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Gentlemen,' quoth he, 'it is my master's happiness that he



<P>has this day a quiet and teachable auditory; and it is hoped



<P>by us that we shall prevail with you not to cast off good



<P>advice.&nbsp; My master has a very great love for you; and



<P>although, as he very well knows, that he runs the hazard of



<P>the anger of King Shaddai, yet love to you will make him do



<P>more than that.&nbsp; Nor doth there need that a word more should



<P>be spoken to confirm for truth what he hath said; there is



<P>not a word but carries with it self-evidence in its bowels;



<P>the very name of the tree may put an end to all controversy



<P>in this matter.&nbsp; I therefore, at this time, shall only add



<P>this advice to you, under and by the leave of my lord;' (and



<P>with that he made Diabolus a very low congee;) 'consider his



<P>words, look on the tree and the promising fruit thereof;



<P>remember also that yet you know but little, and that this is



<P>the way to know more: and if your reasons be not conquered to



<P>accept of such good counsel, you are not the men that I took



<P>you to be.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But when the townsfolk saw that the tree was good for food,



<P>and that it was pleasant to the eye, and a tree to be desired



<P>to make one wise, they did as old Ill-pause advised; they



<P>took and did eat thereof.&nbsp; Now this I should have told you



<P>before, that even then, when this Ill-pause was making his



<P>speech to the townsmen, my Lord Innocency (whether by a shot



<P>from the camp of the giant, or from some sinking qualm that



<P>suddenly took him, or whether by the stinking breath of that



<P>treacherous villain old Ill-pause, for so I am most apt to



<P>think) sunk down in the place where he stood, nor could be



<P>brought to life again.&nbsp; Thus these two brave men died - brave



<P>men, I call them; for they were the beauty and glory of



<P>Mansoul, so long as they lived therein; nor did there now



<P>remain any more a noble spirit in Mansoul; they all fell down



<P>and yielded obedience to Diabolus; and became his slaves and



<P>vassals, as you shall hear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now these being dead, what do the rest of the townsfolk, but,



<P>as men that had found a fool's paradise, they presently, as



<P>afore was hinted, fall to prove the truth of the giant's



<P>words.&nbsp; And, first, they did as Ill-pause had taught them;



<P>they looked, they considered they were taken with the



<P>forbidden fruit; they took thereof, and did eat; and having



<P>eaten, they became immediately drunken therewith.&nbsp; So they



<P>open the gate, both Ear-gate and Eye-gate, and let in



<P>Diabolus with all his bands, quite forgetting their good



<P>Shaddai, his law, and the judgment that he had annexed, with



<P>solemn threatening, to the breach thereof.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;Diabolus, having now obtained entrance in at the gates of



<P>the town, marches up to the middle thereof, to make his



<P>conquest as sure as he could; and finding, by this time, the



<P>affections of the people warmly inclining to him, he, as



<P>thinking it was best striking while the iron is hot, made



<P>this further deceivable speech unto them, saying, 'Alas, my



<P>poor Mansoul!&nbsp; I have done thee indeed this service, as to



<P>promote thee to honour, and to greaten thy liberty; but,



<P>alas! alas! poor Mansoul, thou wantest now one to defend



<P>thee; for assure thyself that when Shaddai shall hear what is



<P>done, he will come; for sorry will he be that thou hast



<P>broken his bonds, and cast his cords away from thee.&nbsp; What



<P>wilt thou do?&nbsp; Wilt thou, after enlargement, suffer thy



<P>privileges to be invaded and taken away, or what wilt resolve



<P>with thyself?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then they all with one consent said to this bramble, 'Do thou



<P>reign over us.'&nbsp; So he accepted the motion, and became the



<P>king of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; This being done, the next thing



<P>was to give him possession of the castle, and so of the whole



<P>strength of the town.&nbsp; Wherefore, into the castle he goes; it



<P>was that which Shaddai built in Mansoul for his own delight



<P>and pleasure; this now was become a den and hold for the



<P>giant Diabolus.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, having got possession of this stately palace or castle,



<P>what doth he but makes it a garrison for himself, and



<P>strengthens and fortifies it with all sorts of provision,



<P>against the King Shaddai, or those that should endeavour the



<P>regaining of it to him and his obedience again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This done, but not thinking himself yet secure enough, in the



<P>next place he bethinks himself of new modelling the town; and



<P>so he does, setting up one, and putting down another at



<P>pleasure.&nbsp; Wherefore my Lord Mayor, whose name was my Lord



<P>Understanding, and Mr. Recorder, whose name was Mr.



<P>Conscience, these he put out of place and power.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As for my Lord Mayor, though he was an understanding man, and



<P>one too that had complied with the rest of the town of



<P>Mansoul in admitting the giant into the town, yet Diabolus



<P>thought not fit to let him abide in his former lustre and



<P>glory, because he was a seeing man.&nbsp; Wherefore he darkened



<P>him, not only by taking from him his office and power, but by



<P>building a high and strong tower, just between the sun's



<P>reflections and the windows of my lord's palace; by which



<P>means his house and all, and the whole of his habitation,



<P>were made as dark as darkness itself.&nbsp; And thus, being



<P>alienated from the light, he became as one that was born



<P>blind.&nbsp; To this, his house, my lord was confined as to a



<P>prison; nor might he, upon his parole, go farther than within



<P>his own bounds.&nbsp; And now, had he had a heart to do for



<P>Mansoul, what could he do for it, or wherein could he be



<P>profitable to her?&nbsp; So then, so long as Mansoul was under the



<P>power and government of Diabolus, (and so long it was under



<P>him, as it was obedient to him, which was even until by a war



<P>it was rescued out of his hand,) so long my Lord Mayor was



<P>rather an impediment in, than an advantage to the famous town



<P>of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As for Mr. Recorder, before the town was taken, he was a man



<P>well read in the laws of his king, and also a man of courage



<P>and faithfulness to speak truth at every occasion; and he had



<P>a tongue as bravely hung as he had a head filled with



<P>judgment.&nbsp; Now, this man Diabolus could by no means abide,



<P>because, though he gave his consent to his coming into the



<P>town, yet he could not, by all the wiles, trials, stratagems,



<P>and devices that he could use, make him wholly his own.



<P>True, he was much degenerated from his former king, and also



<P>much pleased with many of the giant's laws and service; but



<P>all this would not do, forasmuch as he was not wholly his.



<P>He would now and then think upon Shaddai, and have dread of



<P>his law upon him, and then he would speak against Diabolus



<P>with a voice as great as when a lion roareth.&nbsp; Yea, and would



<P>also at certain times, when his fits were upon him, (for you



<P>must know that sometimes he had terrible fits,) make the



<P>whole town of Mansoul shake with his voice: and therefore the



<P>now king of Mansoul could not abide him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Diabolus, therefore, feared the Recorder more than any that



<P>was left alive in the town of Mansoul, because, as I said,



<P>his words did shake the whole town; they were like the



<P>rattling thunder, and also like thunder-claps.&nbsp; Since,



<P>therefore, the giant could not make him wholly his own, what



<P>doth he do but studies all that he could to debauch the old



<P>gentleman, and by debauchery to stupefy his mind, and more



<P>harden his heart in the ways of vanity.&nbsp; And as he attempted,



<P>so he accomplished his design: he debauched the man, and by



<P>little and little so drew him into sin and wickedness, that



<P>at last he was not only debauched, as at first, and so by



<P>consequence defiled, but was almost (at last, I say) past all



<P>conscience of sin.&nbsp; And this was the farthest Diabolus could



<P>go.&nbsp; Wherefore he bethinks him of another project, and that



<P>was, to persuade the men of the town that Mr. Recorder was



<P>mad, and so not to be regarded.&nbsp; And for this he urged his



<P>fits, and said, 'If he be himself, why doth he not do thus



<P>always?&nbsp; But,' quoth he, 'as all mad folks have their fits,



<P>and in them their raving language, so hath this old and



<P>doating gentleman.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thus, by one means or another, he quickly got Mansoul to



<P>slight, neglect, and despise whatever Mr. Recorder could say.



<P>For, besides what already you have heard, Diabolus had a way



<P>to make the old gentleman, when he was merry, unsay and deny



<P>what he in his fits had affirmed.&nbsp; And, indeed, this was the



<P>next way to make himself ridiculous, and to cause that no man



<P>should regard him.&nbsp; Also now he never spake freely for King



<P>Shaddai, but also by force and constraint.&nbsp; Besides, he would



<P>at one time be hot against that at which, at another, he



<P>would hold his peace; so uneven was he now in his doings.



<P>Sometimes he would be as if fast asleep, and again sometimes



<P>as dead, even then when the whole town of Mansoul was in her



<P>career after vanity, and in her dance after the giant's pipe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wherefore, sometimes when Mansoul did use to be frighted with



<P>the thundering voice of the Recorder that was, and when they



<P>did tell Diabolus of it, he would answer, that what the old



<P>gentleman said was neither of love to him nor pity to them,



<P>but of a foolish fondness that he had to be prating; and so



<P>would hush, still, and put all to quiet again.&nbsp; And that he



<P>might leave no argument unurged that might tend to make them



<P>secure, he said, and said it often, 'O Mansoul! consider



<P>that, notwithstanding the old gentleman's rage, and the



<P>rattle of his high and thundering words, you hear nothing of



<P>Shaddai himself;' when, liar and deceiver that he was, every



<P>outcry of Mr. Recorder against the sin of Mansoul was the



<P>voice of God in him to them.&nbsp; But he goes on, and says, 'You



<P>see that he values not the loss nor rebellion of the town of



<P>Mansoul, nor will he trouble himself with calling his town to



<P>a reckoning for their giving themselves to me.&nbsp; He knows that



<P>though you were his, now you are lawfully mine; so, leaving



<P>us one to another, he now hath shaken his hands of us.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Moreover, O Mansoul!' quoth he, 'consider how I have served



<P>you, even to the uttermost of my power; and that with the



<P>best that I have, could get, or procure for you in all the



<P>world: besides, I dare say that the laws and customs that you



<P>now are under, and by which you do homage to me, do yield you



<P>more solace and content than did the paradise that at first



<P>you possessed.&nbsp; Your liberty also, as yourselves do very well



<P>know, has been greatly widened and enlarged by me; whereas I



<P>found you a penned-up people.&nbsp; I have not laid any restraint



<P>upon you; you have no law, statute, or judgment of mine to



<P>fright you; I call none of you to account for your doings,



<P>except the madman - you know who I mean; I have granted you



<P>to live, each man like a prince in his own, even with as



<P>little control from me as I myself have from you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And thus would Diabolus hush up and quiet the town of



<P>Mansoul, when the Recorder that was, did at times molest



<P>them: yea, and with such cursed orations as these, would set



<P>the whole town in a rage and fury against the old gentleman.



<P>Yea, the rascal crew at some times would be for destroying



<P>him.&nbsp; They have often wished, in my hearing, that he had



<P>lived a thousand miles off from them: his company, his words,



<P>yea, the sight of him, and specially when they remembered how



<P>in old times he did use to threaten and condemn them, (for



<P>all he was now so debauched,) did terrify and afflict them



<P>sore.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But all wishes were vain, for I do not know how, unless by



<P>the power of Shaddai, and his wisdom, he was preserved in



<P>being amongst them.&nbsp; Besides, his house was as strong as a



<P>castle, and stood hard by a stronghold of the town: moreover,



<P>if at any time any of the crew or rabble attempted to make



<P>him away, he could pull up the sluices, and let in such



<P>floods as would drown all round about him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But to leave Mr. Recorder, and to come to my Lord Willbewill,



<P>another of the gentry of the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; This



<P>Willbewill was as high-born as any man in Mansoul, and was as



<P>much, if not more, a freeholder than many of them were;



<P>besides, if I remember my tale aright, he had some privileges



<P>peculiar to himself in the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Now,



<P>together with these, he was a man of great strength,



<P>resolution, and courage, nor in his occasion could any turn



<P>him away.&nbsp; But I say, whether he was proud of his estate,



<P>privileges, strength, or what, (but sure it was through pride



<P>of something,) he scorns now to be a slave in Mansoul; and



<P>therefore resolves to bear office under Diabolus, that he



<P>might (such an one as he was) be a petty ruler and governor



<P>in Mansoul.&nbsp; And, headstrong man that he was! thus he began



<P>betimes; for this man, when Diabolus did make his oration at



<P>Ear-gate, was one of the first that was for consenting to his



<P>words, and for accepting his counsel at wholesome, and that



<P>was for the opening of the gate, and for letting him into the



<P>town; wherefore Diabolus had a kindness for him, and



<P>therefore he designed for him a place.&nbsp; And perceiving the



<P>valour and stoutness of the man, he coveted to have him for



<P>one of his great ones, to act and do in matters of the



<P>highest concern.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So he sent for him, and talked with him of that secret matter



<P>that lay in his breast, but there needed not much persuasion



<P>in the case.&nbsp; For as at first he was willing that Diabolus



<P>should be let into the town, so now he was as willing to



<P>serve him there.&nbsp; When the tyrant, therefore, perceived the



<P>willingness of my lord to serve him, and that his mind stood



<P>bending that way, he forthwith made him the captain of the



<P>castle, governor of the wall, and keeper of the gates of



<P>Mansoul: yea, there was a clause in his commission, that



<P>nothing without him should be done in all the town of



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; So that now, next to Diabolus himself, who but my



<P>Lord Willbewill in all the town of Mansoul! nor could



<P>anything now be done, but at his will and pleasure,



<P>throughout the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; He had also one Mr. Mind for



<P>his clerk, a man to speak on every way like his master: for



<P>he and his lord were in principle one, and in practice not



<P>far asunder.&nbsp; And now was Mansoul brought under to purpose,



<P>and made to fulfil the lusts of the will, and of the mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But it will not out of my thoughts what a desperate one this



<P>Willbewill was when power was put into his hand.&nbsp; First, he



<P>flatly denied that he owed any suit or service to his former



<P>prince and liege lord.&nbsp; This done, in the next place he took



<P>an oath, and swore fidelity to his great master Diabolus, and



<P>then, being stated and settled in his places, offices,



<P>advancements, and preferments, oh! you cannot think, unless



<P>you had seen it, the strange work that this workman made in



<P>the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>First, he maligned Mr. Recorder to death; he would neither



<P>endure to see him, nor hear the words of his mouth; he would



<P>shut his eyes when he saw him, and stop his ears when he



<P>heard him speak.&nbsp; Also he could not endure that so much as a



<P>fragment of the law of Shaddai should be anywhere seen in the



<P>town.&nbsp; For example, his clerk, Mr. Mind, had some old, rent,



<P>and torn parchments of the law of Shaddai in his house, but



<P>when Willbewill saw them, he cast them behind his back.



<P>True, Mr. Recorder had some of the laws in his study; but my



<P>lord could by no means come at them.&nbsp; He also thought and



<P>said, that the windows of my old Lord Mayor's house were



<P>always too light for the profit of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; The



<P>light of a candle he could not endure.&nbsp; Now nothing at all



<P>pleased Willbewill but what pleased Diabolus his lord.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was none like him to trumpet about the streets the



<P>brave nature, the wise conduct, and great glory of the king



<P>Diabolus.&nbsp; He would range and rove throughout all the streets



<P>of Mansoul to cry up his illustrious lord, and would make



<P>himself even as an abject, among the base and rascal crew, to



<P>cry up his valiant prince.&nbsp; And I say, when and wheresoever



<P>he found these vassals, he would even make himself as one of



<P>them.&nbsp; In all ill courses he would act without bidding, and



<P>do mischief without commandment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Lord Willbewill also had a deputy under him, and his name



<P>was Mr. Affection, one that was also greatly debauched in his



<P>principles, and answerable thereto in his life: he was wholly



<P>given to the flesh, and therefore they called him Vile-



<P>Affection.&nbsp; Now there was he and one Carnal-Lust, the



<P>daughter of Mr. Mind, (like to like,) that fell in love, and



<P>made a match, and were married; and, as I take it, they had



<P>several children, as Impudent, Blackmouth, and Hate-Reproof.



<P>These three were black boys.&nbsp; And besides these they had



<P>three daughters, as Scorn-Truth and Slight-God, and the name



<P>of the youngest was Revenge.&nbsp; These were all married in the



<P>town, and also begot and yielded many bad brats, too many to



<P>be here inserted.&nbsp; But to pass by this.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the giant had thus engarrisoned himself in the town of



<P>Mansoul, and had put down and set up whom he thought good, he



<P>betakes himself to defacing.&nbsp; Now there was in the market-



<P>place in Mansoul, and also upon the gates of the castle, an



<P>image of the blessed King Shaddai.&nbsp; This image was so exactly



<P>engraven, (and it was engraven in gold,) that it did the most



<P>resemble Shaddai himself of anything that then was extant in



<P>the world.&nbsp; This he basely commanded to be defaced, and it



<P>was as basely done by the hand of Mr. No-Truth.&nbsp; Now you must



<P>know that, as Diabolus had commanded, and that by the hand of



<P>Mr. No-Truth, the image of Shaddai was defaced, he likewise



<P>gave order that the same Mr. No-Truth should set up in its



<P>stead the horrid and formidable image of Diabolus, to the



<P>great contempt of the former King, and debasing of his town



<P>of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Moreover, Diabolus made havoc of all remains of the laws and



<P>statutes of Shaddai that could be found in the town of



<P>Mansoul; to wit, such as contained either the doctrines of



<P>morals, with all civil and natural documents.&nbsp; Also relative



<P>severities he sought to extinguish.&nbsp; To be short, there was



<P>nothing of the remains of good in Mansoul which he and



<P>Willbewill sought not to destroy; for their design was to



<P>turn Mansoul into a brute, and to make it like to the sensual



<P>sow, by the hand of Mr. No-Truth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he had destroyed what law and good orders he could, then



<P>further to effect his design, namely, to alienate Mansoul



<P>from Shaddai her King, he commands, and they set up his own



<P>vain edicts, statutes, and commandments, in all places of



<P>resort or concourse in Mansoul, to wit, such as gave liberty



<P>to the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eyes, and the



<P>pride of life, which are not of Shaddai, but of the world.



<P>He encouraged, countenanced, and promoted lasciviousness, and



<P>all ungodliness there.&nbsp; Yea, much more did Diabolus to



<P>encourage wickedness in the town of Mansoul; he promised them



<P>peace, content, joy, and bliss, in doing his commands, and



<P>that they should never be called to an account for their not



<P>doing the contrary.&nbsp; And let this serve to give a taste to



<P>them that love to hear tell of what is done beyond their



<P>knowledge afar off in other countries.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now Mansoul being wholly at his beck, and brought wholly to



<P>his bow, nothing was heard or seen therein but that which



<P>tended to set up him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But now he, having disabled the Lord Mayor and Mr. Recorder



<P>from bearing of office in Mansoul, and seeing that the town,



<P>before he came to it, was the most ancient of corporations in



<P>the world, and fearing, if he did not maintain greatness,



<P>they at any time should object that he had done them an



<P>injury; therefore, I say, (that they might see that he did



<P>not intend to lessen their grandeur, or to take from them any



<P>of their advantageous things,) he did choose for them a Lord



<P>Mayor and a Recorder himself, and such as contented them at



<P>the heart, and such also as pleased him wondrous well.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The name of the Mayor that was of Diabolus' making was the



<P>Lord Lustings, a man that had neither eyes nor ears.&nbsp; All



<P>that he did, whether as a man or an officer, he did it



<P>naturally, as doth the beast.&nbsp; And that which made him yet



<P>the more ignoble, though not to Mansoul, yet to them that



<P>beheld and were grieved for its ruin, was, that he never



<P>could favour good, but evil.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Recorder was one whose name was Forget-Good, and a very



<P>sorry fellow he was.&nbsp; He could remember nothing but mischief,



<P>and to do it with delight.&nbsp; He was naturally prone to do



<P>things that were hurtful, even hurtful to the town of



<P>Mansoul, and to all the dwellers there.&nbsp; These two,



<P>therefore, by their power and practice, examples, and smiles



<P>upon evil, did much more grammar and settle the common people



<P>in hurtful ways.&nbsp; For who doth not perceive that when those



<P>that sit aloft are vile and corrupt themselves, they corrupt



<P>the whole region and country where they are?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Besides these, Diabolus made several burgesses and aldermen



<P>in Mansoul, such as out of whom the town, when it needed,



<P>might choose them officers, governors, and magistrates.&nbsp; And



<P>these are the names of the chief of them: Mr. Incredulity,



<P>Mr. Haughty, Mr. Swearing, Mr. Whoring, Mr. Hard-Heart, Mr.



<P>Pitiless, Mr. Fury, Mr. No-Truth, Mr. Stand-to-Lies, Mr.



<P>False-Peace, Mr. Drunkenness, Mr. Cheating, Mr. Atheism -



<P>thirteen in all.&nbsp; Mr. Incredulity is the eldest, and Mr.



<P>Atheism the youngest of the company.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was also an election of common councilmen and others,



<P>as bailiffs, sergeants, constables, and others; but all of



<P>them like to those afore-named, being either fathers,



<P>brothers, cousins, or nephews to them, whose names, for



<P>brevity's sake, I omit to mention.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the giant had thus far proceeded in his work, in the



<P>next place, he betook him to build some strongholds in the



<P>town, and he built three that seemed to be impregnable.&nbsp; The



<P>first he called the Hold of Defiance, because it was made to



<P>command the whole town, and to keep it from the knowledge of



<P>its ancient King.&nbsp; The second he called Midnight Hold,



<P>because it was built on purpose to keep Mansoul from the true



<P>knowledge of itself.&nbsp; The third was called Sweet-Sin Hold,



<P>because by that he fortified Mansoul against all desires of



<P>good.&nbsp; The first of these holds stood close by Eye-gate,



<P>that, as much might be, light might be darkened there; the



<P>second was built hard by the old castle, to the end that that



<P>might be made more blind, if possible; and the third stood in



<P>the market-place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He that Diabolus made governor over the first of these was



<P>one Spite-God, a most blasphemous wretch: he came with the



<P>whole rabble of them that came against Mansoul at first, and



<P>was himself one of themselves.&nbsp; He that was made the governor



<P>of Midnight Hold was one Love-no-Light; he was also of them



<P>that came first against the town.&nbsp; And he that was made the



<P>governor of the hold called Sweet-Sin Hold was one whose name



<P>was Love-Flesh: he was also a very lewd fellow, but not of



<P>that country where the other are bound.&nbsp; This fellow could



<P>find more sweetness when he stood sucking of a lust than he



<P>did in all the paradise of God.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And now Diabolus thought himself safe.&nbsp; He had taken Mansoul,



<P>he had engarrisoned himself therein; he had put down the old



<P>officers, and had set up new ones; he had defaced the image



<P>of Shaddai, and had set up his own; he had spoiled the old



<P>law books, and had promoted his own vain lies; he had made



<P>him new magistrates, and set up new aldermen; he had builded



<P>him new holds, and had manned them for himself: and all this



<P>he did to make himself secure, in case the good Shaddai, or



<P>his Son, should come to make an incursion upon him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now you may well think, that long before this time, word, by



<P>some one or other, could not but be carried to the good King



<P>Shaddai, how his Mansoul, in the continent of Universe, was



<P>lost; and that the runagate giant Diabolus, once one of his



<P>Majesty's servants, had, in rebellion against the King, made



<P>sure thereof for himself.&nbsp; Yea, tidings were carried and



<P>brought to the King thereof, and that to a very circumstance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At first, how Diabolus came upon Mansoul (they being a simple



<P>people and innocent) with craft, subtlety, lies, and guile.



<P>ITEM, that he had treacherously slain the right noble and



<P>valiant captain, their Captain Resistance, as he stood upon



<P>the gate with the rest of the townsmen.&nbsp; ITEM, how my brave



<P>Lord Innocent fell down dead (with grief, some say, or with



<P>being poisoned with the stinking breath of one Ill-Pause, as



<P>say others) at the hearing of his just lord and rightful



<P>prince, Shaddai, so abused by the mouth of so filthy a



<P>Diabolian as that varlet Ill-Pause was.&nbsp; The messenger



<P>further told, that after this Ill-Pause had made a short



<P>oration to the townsmen in behalf of Diabolus, his master;



<P>the simple town, believing that what was said was true, with



<P>one consent did open Ear-gate, the chief gate of the



<P>corporation, and did let him, with his crew, into a



<P>possession of the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; He further showed



<P>how Diabolus had served the Lord Mayor and Mr. Recorder, to



<P>wit, that he had put them from all place of power and trust.



<P>ITEM, he showed also that my Lord Willbewill was turned a



<P>very rebel, and runagate, and that so was one Mr. Mind, his



<P>clerk; and that they two did range and revel it all the town



<P>over, and teach the wicked ones their ways.&nbsp; He said,



<P>moreover, that this Willbewill was put into great trust, and



<P>particularly that Diabolus had put into Willbewill's hand all



<P>the strong places in Mansoul; and that Mr. Affection was made



<P>my Lord Willbewill's deputy in his most rebellious affairs.



<P>'Yea,' said the messenger, 'this monster, Lord Willbewill,



<P>has openly disavowed his King Shaddai, and hath horribly



<P>given his faith and plighted his troth to Diabolus.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Also,' said the messenger, 'besides all this, the new king,



<P>or rather rebellious tyrant, over the once famous, but now



<P>perishing town of Mansoul, has set up a Lord Mayor and a



<P>Recorder of his own.&nbsp; For Mayor, he has set up one Mr.



<P>Lustings; and for Recorder, Mr. Forget-Good; two of the



<P>vilest of all the town of Mansoul.'&nbsp; This faithful messenger



<P>also proceeded, and told what a sort of new burgesses



<P>Diabolus had made; also that he had built several strong



<P>forts, towers, and strongholds in Mansoul.&nbsp; He told, too, the



<P>which I had almost forgot, how Diabolus had put the town of



<P>Mansoul into arms, the better to capacitate them, on his



<P>behalf, to make resistance against Shaddai their King, should



<P>he come to reduce them to their former obedience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now this tidings-teller did not deliver his relation of



<P>things in private, but in open court, the King and his Son,



<P>high lords, chief captains, and nobles, being all there



<P>present to hear.&nbsp; But by that they had heard the whole of the



<P>story, it would have amazed one to have seen, had he been



<P>there to behold it, what sorrow and grief, and compunction of



<P>spirit, there was among all sorts, to think that famous



<P>Mansoul was now taken: only the King and his Son foresaw all



<P>this long before, yea, and sufficiently provided for the



<P>relief of Mansoul, though they told not everybody thereof.



<P>Yet because they also would have a share in condoling of the



<P>Misery of Mansoul, therefore they also did, and that at a



<P>rate of the highest degree, bewail the losing of Mansoul.



<P>The King said plainly that it grieved him at the heart, and



<P>you may be sure that his Son was not a whit behind him.&nbsp; Thus



<P>gave they conviction to all about them that they had love and



<P>compassion for the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Well, when the



<P>King and his Son were retired into the privy chamber, there



<P>they again consulted about what they had designed before, to



<P>wit, that as Mansoul should in time be suffered to be lost,



<P>so as certainly it should be recovered again; recovered, I



<P>say, in such a way, as that both the King and his Son would



<P>get themselves eternal fame and glory thereby.&nbsp; Wherefore,



<P>after this consult, the Son of Shaddai (a sweet and comely



<P>Person, and one that had always great affection for those



<P>that were in affliction, but one that had mortal enmity in



<P>his heart against Diabolus, because he was designed for it,



<P>and because he sought his crown and dignity) - this Son of



<P>Shaddai, I say, having stricken hands with his Father and



<P>promised that he would be his servant to recover his Mansoul



<P>again, stood by his resolution, nor would he repent of the



<P>same.&nbsp; The purport of which agreement was this: to wit, that



<P>at a certain time, prefixed by both, the King's Son should



<P>take a journey into the country of Universe, and there, in a



<P>way of justice and equity, by making amends for the follies



<P>of Mansoul, he should lay a foundation of perfect deliverance



<P>from Diabolus and from his tyranny.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Moreover Emmanuel resolved to make, at a time convenient, a



<P>war upon the giant Diabolus, even while he was possessed of



<P>the town of Mansoul; and that he would fairly by strength of



<P>hand drive him out of his hold, his nest, and take it to



<P>himself to be his habitation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This now being resolved upon, order was given to the Lord



<P>Chief Secretary to draw up a fair record of what was



<P>determined, and to cause that it should be published in all



<P>the corners of the kingdom of Universe.&nbsp; A short breviate of



<P>the contents thereof you may, if you please, take here as



<P>follows:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Let all men know who are concerned, that the Son of Shaddai,



<P>the great King, is engaged by covenant to his Father to bring



<P>his Mansoul to him again; yea, and to put Mansoul, too,



<P>through the power of his matchless love, into a far better



<P>and more happy condition than it was in before it was taken



<P>by Diabolus.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These papers, therefore, were published in several places, to



<P>the no little molestation of the tyrant Diabolus; 'for now,'



<P>thought he, 'I shall be molested, and my habitation will be



<P>taken from me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But when this matter, I mean this purpose of the King and his



<P>Son, did at first take air at court, who can tell how the



<P>high lords, chief captains, and noble princes that were



<P>there, were taken with the business!&nbsp; First, they whispered



<P>it one to another, and after that it began to ring out



<P>through the King's palace, all wondering at the glorious



<P>design that between the King and his Son was on foot for the



<P>miserable town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Yea, the courtiers could scarce



<P>do anything either for the King or kingdom, but they would



<P>mix, with the doing thereof, a noise of the love of the King



<P>and his Son, that they had for the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nor could these lords, high captains, and princes be content



<P>to keep this news at court; yea, before the records thereof



<P>were perfected, themselves came down and told it in Universe.



<P>At last it came to the ears, as I said, of Diabolus, to his



<P>no little discontent; for you must think it would perplex him



<P>to hear of such a design against him.&nbsp; Well, but after a few



<P>casts in his mind, he concluded upon these four things.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>First, that this news, these good tidings, (if possible,)



<P>should be kept from the ears of the town of Mansoul; 'for,'



<P>said he, 'if they should once come to the knowledge that



<P>Shaddai, their former King, and Emmanuel his Son, are



<P>contriving good for the town of Mansoul, what can be expected



<P>by me, but that Mansoul will make a revolt from under my hand



<P>and government, and return again to him?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, to accomplish this his design, he renews his flattery



<P>with my Lord Willbewill, and also gives him strict charge and



<P>command, that he should keep watch by day and by night at all



<P>the gates of the town, especially Ear-gate and Eye-gate; 'for



<P>I hear of a design,' quoth he, 'a design to make us all



<P>traitors, and that Mansoul must be reduced to its first



<P>bondage again.&nbsp; I hope they are but flying stories,' quoth



<P>he; 'however, let no such news by any means be let into



<P>Mansoul, lest the people be dejected thereat.&nbsp; I think, my



<P>lord, it can be no welcome news to you; I am sure it is none



<P>to me; and I think that, at this time, it should be all our



<P>wisdom and care to nip the head of all such rumours as shall



<P>tend to trouble our people.&nbsp; Wherefore I desire, my lord,



<P>that you will in this matter do as I say.&nbsp; Let there be



<P>strong guards daily kept at every gate of the town.&nbsp; Stop



<P>also and examine from whence such come that you perceive do



<P>from far come hither to trade, nor let them by any means be



<P>admitted into Mansoul, unless you shall plainly perceive that



<P>they are favourers of our excellent government.&nbsp; I command,



<P>moreover,' said Diabolus, 'that there be spies continually



<P>walking up and down the town of Mansoul, and let them have



<P>power to suppress and destroy any that they shall perceive to



<P>be plotting against us, or that shall prate of what by



<P>Shaddai and Emmanuel is intended.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This, therefore, was accordingly done; my Lord Willbewill



<P>hearkened to his lord and master, went willingly after the



<P>commandment, and, with all the diligence he could, kept any



<P>that would from going out abroad, or that sought to bring



<P>these tidings to Mansoul, from coming into the town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Secondly, this done, in the next place, Diabolus, that he



<P>might make Mansoul as sure as he could, frames and imposes a



<P>new oath and horrible covenant upon the townsfolk:- To wit,



<P>that they should never desert him nor his government, nor yet



<P>betray him, nor seek to alter his laws; but that they should



<P>own, confess, stand by, and acknowledge him for their



<P>rightful king, in defiance to any that do or hereafter shall,



<P>by any pretence, law, or title whatever, lay claim to the



<P>town of Mansoul; thinking, belike, that Shaddai had not power



<P>to absolve them from this covenant with death, and agreement



<P>with hell.&nbsp; Nor did the silly Mansoul stick or boggle at all



<P>at this most monstrous engagement; but, as if it had been a



<P>sprat in the mouth of a whale, they swallowed it without any



<P>chewing.&nbsp; Were they troubled at all?&nbsp; Nay, they rather



<P>bragged and boasted of their so brave fidelity to the tyrant,



<P>their pretended king, swearing that they would never be



<P>changelings, nor forsake their old lord for a new.&nbsp; Thus did



<P>Diabolus tie poor Mansoul fast.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thirdly.&nbsp; But jealousy, that never thinks itself strong



<P>enough, put him, in the next place, upon another exploit,



<P>which was, yet more, if possible, to debauch this town of



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; Wherefore he caused, by the hand of one Mr. Filth,



<P>an odious, nasty, lascivious piece of beastliness to be drawn



<P>up in writing, and to be set upon the castle gates; whereby



<P>he granted and gave license to all his true and trusty sons



<P>in Mansoul to do whatsoever their lustful appetites prompted



<P>them to do; and that no man was to let, hinder, or control



<P>them, upon pain of incurring the displeasure of their prince.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now this he did for these reasons:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1. That the town of Mansoul might be yet made weaker and



<P>weaker, and so more unable, should tidings come that their



<P>redemption was designed, to believe, hope, or consent to the



<P>truth thereof; for reason says, The bigger the sinner, the



<P>less grounds of hopes of mercy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2. The second reason was, if perhaps Emmanuel, the Son of



<P>Shaddai their King, by seeing the horrible and profane doings



<P>of the town of Mansoul, might repent, though entered into a



<P>covenant of redeeming them, of pursuing that covenant of



<P>their redemption; for he knew that Shaddai was holy, and that



<P>his Son Emmanuel was holy; yea, he knew it by woeful



<P>experience, for for his iniquity and sin was Diabolus cast



<P>from the highest orbs.&nbsp; Wherefore what more rational than for



<P>him to conclude that thus, for sin, it might fare with



<P>Mansoul?&nbsp; But fearing also lest this knot should break, he



<P>bethinks himself of another, to wit:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fourthly.&nbsp; To endeavour to possess all hearts in the town of



<P>Mansoul that Shaddai was raising an army, to come to



<P>overthrow and utterly to destroy this town of Mansoul.&nbsp; And



<P>this he did to forestall any tidings that might come to their



<P>ears of their deliverance: 'For,' thought he, 'if I first



<P>bruit this, the tidings that shall come after will all be



<P>swallowed up of this; for what else will Mansoul say, when



<P>they shall hear that they must be delivered, but that the



<P>true meaning is, Shaddai intends to destroy them?&nbsp; Wherefore



<P>he summons the whole town into the market-place, and there,



<P>with deceitful tongue, thus he addressed himself unto them:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Gentlemen, and my very good friends, you are all, as you



<P>know, my legal subjects, and men of the famous town of



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; You know how, from the first day that I have been



<P>with you until now, I have behaved myself among you, and what



<P>liberty and great privileges you have enjoyed under my



<P>government, I hope to your honour and mine, and also to your



<P>content and delight.&nbsp; Now, my famous Mansoul, a noise of



<P>trouble there is abroad, of trouble to the town of Mansoul;



<P>sorry I am thereof for your sakes: for I received but now by



<P>the post from my Lord Lucifer, (and he useth to have good



<P>intelligence,) that your old King Shaddai is raising an army



<P>to come against you, to destroy you root and branch; and



<P>this, O Mansoul, is now the cause that at this time I have



<P>called you together, namely, to advise what in this juncture



<P>is best to be done.&nbsp; For my part, I am but one, and can with



<P>ease shift for myself, did I list to seek my own case, and to



<P>leave my Mansoul in all the danger; but my heart is so firmly



<P>united to you, and so unwilling am I to leave you, that I am



<P>willing to stand and fall with you, to the utmost hazard that



<P>shall befall me.&nbsp; What say you, O my Mansoul?&nbsp; Will you now



<P>desert your old friend, or do you think of standing by me?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then, as one man, with one mouth, they cried out together,



<P>'Let him die the death that will not.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Diabolus again, 'It is in vain for us to hope for



<P>quarter, for this King knows not how to show it.&nbsp; True,



<P>perhaps, he, at his first sitting down before us, will talk



<P>of and pretend to mercy, that thereby, with the more ease,



<P>and less trouble, he may again make himself the master of



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; Whatever, therefore, he shall say, believe not one



<P>syllable or tittle of it; for all such language is but to



<P>overcome us, and to make us, while we wallow in our blood,



<P>the trophies of his merciless victory.&nbsp; My mind is,



<P>therefore, that we resolve to the last man to resist him, and



<P>not to believe him upon any terms, for in at that door will



<P>come our danger.&nbsp; But shall we be flattered out of our lives?



<P>I hope you know more of the rudiments of politics than to



<P>suffer yourselves so pitifully to be served.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But suppose he should, if he get us to yield, save some of



<P>our lives, or the lives of some of them that are underlings



<P>in Mansoul, what help will that be to you that are the chief



<P>of the town, especially you whom I have set up and whose



<P>greatness has been procured by you through your faithful



<P>sticking to me?&nbsp; And suppose, again, that he should give



<P>quarter to every one of you, be sure he will bring you into



<P>that bondage under which you were captivated before, or a



<P>worse, and then what good will your lives do you?&nbsp; Shall you



<P>with him live in pleasure as you do now?&nbsp; No, no; you must be



<P>bound by laws that will pinch you, and be made to do that



<P>which at present is hateful to you.&nbsp; I am for you, if you are



<P>for me; and it is better to die valiantly than to live like



<P>pitiful slaves.&nbsp; But, I say, the life of a slave will be



<P>counted a life too good for Mansoul now.&nbsp; Blood, blood,



<P>nothing but blood is in every blast of Shaddai's trumpet



<P>against poor Mansoul now.&nbsp; Pray, be concerned; I hear he is



<P>coming.&nbsp; Up, and stand to your arms that now, while you have



<P>any leisure, I may learn you some feats of war.&nbsp; Armour for



<P>you I have, and by me it is; yea, and it is sufficient for



<P>Mansoul from top to toe; nor can you be hurt by what his



<P>force can do, if you shall keep it well girt and fastened



<P>about you.&nbsp; Come, therefore, to my castle, and welcome, and



<P>harness yourselves for the war.&nbsp; There is helmet,



<P>breastplate, sword, and shield, and what not, that will make



<P>you fight like men.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Upon this speech, the town of Mansoul did again harden their



<P>hearts yet more against the captains of Shaddai.&nbsp; The



<P>thoughts of his greatness did quite quash them, and the



<P>thoughts of his holiness sunk them in despair.&nbsp; Wherefore,



<P>after a short consult, they (of the Diabolonian party they



<P>were) sent back this word by the trumpeter, That, for their



<P>parts, they were resolved to stick to their king, but never



<P>to yield to Shaddai; so it was but in vain to give them any



<P>further summons, for they had rather die upon the place than



<P>yield.&nbsp; And now things seemed to be gone quite back, and



<P>Mansoul to be out of reach or call, yet the captains who knew



<P>what their Lord could do, would not yet be beat out of heart;



<P>they therefore sent them another summons, more sharp and



<P>severe than the last; but the oftener they were sent to, to



<P>reconcile to Shaddai, the further off they were.&nbsp; 'As they



<P>called them, so they went from them - yea, though they called



<P>them to the Most High.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So they ceased that way to deal with them any more, and



<P>inclined to think of another way.&nbsp; The captains, therefore,



<P>did gather themselves together, to have free conference among



<P>themselves, to know what was yet to be done to gain the town,



<P>and to deliver it from the tyranny of Diabolus; and one said



<P>after this manner, and another after that.&nbsp; Then stood up the



<P>right noble the Captain Conviction, and said, 'My brethren,



<P>mine opinion is this:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'First, that we continually play our slings into the town,



<P>and keep it in a continual alarm, molesting them day and



<P>night.&nbsp; By thus doing, we shall stop the growth of their



<P>rampant spirit; for a lion may be tamed by continual



<P>molestation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Secondly, this done, I advise that, in the next place, we



<P>with one consent draw up a petition to our Lord Shaddai, by



<P>which, after we have showed our King the condition of Mansoul



<P>and of affairs here, and have begged his pardon for our no



<P>better success, we will earnestly implore his Majesty's help,



<P>and that he will please to send us more force and power, and



<P>some gallant and well-spoken commander to head them, that so



<P>his Majesty may not lose the benefit of these his good



<P>beginnings, but may complete his conquest upon the town of



<P>Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To this speech of the noble Captain Conviction they as one



<P>man consented, and agreed that a petition should forthwith be



<P>drawn up, and sent by a fit man away to Shaddai with speed.



<P>The contents of the petition were thus:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Most gracious and glorious King, the Lord of the best world,



<P>and the builder of the town of Mansoul, we have, dread



<P>Sovereign, at thy commandment, put our lives in jeopardy, and



<P>at thy bidding made a war upon the famous town of Mansoul.



<P>When we went up against it, we did, according to our



<P>commission, first offer conditions of peace unto it.&nbsp; But



<P>they, great King, set light by our counsel, and would none of



<P>our reproof.&nbsp; They were for shutting their gates, and for



<P>keeping us out of the town.&nbsp; They also mounted their guns,



<P>they sallied out upon us, and have done us what damage they



<P>could; but we pursued them with alarm upon alarm, requiting



<P>them with such retribution as was meet, and have done some



<P>execution upon the town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Diabolus, Incredulity, and Willbewill are the great doers



<P>against us: now we are in our winter quarters, but so as that



<P>we do yet with an high hand molest and distress the town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Once, as we think, had we had but one substantial friend in



<P>the town, such as would but have seconded the sound of our



<P>summons as they ought, the people might have yielded



<P>themselves; but there were none but enemies there, nor any to



<P>speak in behalf of our Lord to the town.&nbsp; Wherefore, though



<P>we have done as we could, yet Mansoul abides in a state of



<P>rebellion against thee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Now, King of kings, let it please thee to pardon the



<P>unsuccessfulness of thy servants, who have been no more



<P>advantageous in so desirable a work as the conquering of



<P>Mansoul is.&nbsp; And send, Lord, as we now desire, more forces to



<P>Mansoul, that it may be subdued; and a man to head them, that



<P>the town may both love and fear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'We do not thus speak because we are willing to relinquish



<P>the wars, (for we are for laying of our bones against the



<P>place,) but that the town of Mansoul may be won for thy



<P>Majesty.&nbsp; We also pray thy Majesty, for expedition in this



<P>matter, that, after their conquest, we may be at liberty to



<P>be sent about other thy gracious designs.&nbsp; Amen.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The petition, thus drawn up, was sent away with haste to the



<P>King by the hand of that good man, Mr. Love-to-Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When this petition was come to the palace of the King, who



<P>should it be delivered to but to the King's Son?&nbsp; So he took



<P>it and read it, and because the contents of it pleased him



<P>well, he mended, and also in some things added to the



<P>petition himself.&nbsp; So, after he had made such amendments and



<P>additions as he thought convenient, with his own hand, he



<P>carried it in to the King; to whom, when he had with



<P>obeisance delivered it, he put on authority, and spake to it



<P>himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now the King, at the sight of the petition, was glad; but how



<P>much more, think you, when it was seconded by his Son!&nbsp; It



<P>pleased him also to hear that his servants who camped against



<P>Mansoul were so hearty in the work, and so steadfast in their



<P>resolves, and that they had already got some ground upon the



<P>famous town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wherefore the King called to him Emmanuel, his Son, who said,



<P>'Here am I, my Father.'&nbsp; Then said the King, 'Thou knowest,



<P>as I do myself, the condition of the town of Mansoul, and



<P>what we have purposed, and what thou hast done to redeem it.



<P>Come now, therefore, my Son, and prepare thyself for the war,



<P>for thou shalt go to my camp at Mansoul.&nbsp; Thou shalt also



<P>there prosper and prevail, and conquer the town of Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the King's Son, 'Thy law is within my heart: I



<P>delight to do thy will.&nbsp; This is the day that I have longed



<P>for, and the work that I have waited for all this while.



<P>Grant me, therefore, what force thou shalt in thy wisdom



<P>think meet; and I will go and will deliver from Diabolus, and



<P>from his power, thy perishing town of Mansoul.&nbsp; My heart has



<P>been often pained within me for the miserable town of



<P>Mansoul; but now it is rejoiced, but now it is glad,'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And with that he leaped over the mountains for joy, saying,



<P>'I have not, in my heart, thought anything too dear for



<P>Mansoul: the day of vengeance is in mine heart for thee, my



<P>Mansoul: and glad am I that thou, my Father, hast made me the



<P>Captain of their salvation.&nbsp; And I will now begin to plague



<P>all those that have been a plague to my town of Mansoul, and



<P>will deliver it from their hand.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the King's Son had said thus to his Father, it presently



<P>flew like lightning round about at court; yea, it there



<P>became the only talk what Emmanuel was to go to do for the



<P>famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; But you cannot think how the



<P>courtiers, too, were taken with this design of the Prince;



<P>yea, so affected were they with this work, and with the



<P>justness of the war, that the highest lord and greatest peer



<P>of the kingdom did covet to have commissions under Emmanuel,



<P>to go to help to recover again to Shaddai the miserable town



<P>of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then was it concluded that some should go and carry tidings



<P>to the camp, that Emmanuel was to come to recover Mansoul,



<P>and that he would bring along with him so mighty, so



<P>impregnable a force, that he could not be resisted.&nbsp; But, oh!



<P>how ready were the high ones at court to run like lackeys to



<P>carry these tidings to the camp that was at Mansoul.&nbsp; Now,



<P>when the captains perceived that the King would send Emmanuel



<P>his Son, and that it also delighted the Son to be sent on



<P>this errand by the great Shaddai his Father, they also, to



<P>show how they were pleased at the thoughts of his coming gave



<P>a shout that made the earth rend at the sound thereof.&nbsp; Yea,



<P>the mountains did answer again by echo, and Diabolus himself



<P>did totter and shake.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For you must know, that though the town of Mansoul itself was



<P>not much, if at all concerned with the project, (for, alas



<P>for them! they were wofully besotted, for they chiefly



<P>regarded their pleasure and their lusts,) yet Diabolus their



<P>governor was; for he had his spies continually abroad, who



<P>brought him intelligence of all things, and they told him



<P>what was doing at court against him, and that Emmanuel would



<P>shortly certainly come with a power to invade him.&nbsp; Nor was



<P>there any man at court, nor peer of the kingdom, that



<P>Diabolus so feared as he feared this Prince; for, if you



<P>remember, I showed you before that Diabolus had felt the



<P>weight of his hand already; so that, since it was he that was



<P>to come, this made him the more afraid.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, you see how I have told you that the King's Son was



<P>engaged to come from the court to save Mansoul, and that his



<P>Father had made him the Captain of the forces.&nbsp; The time,



<P>therefore, of his setting forth being now expired, he



<P>addressed himself for his march, and taketh with him, for his



<P>power, five noble captains and their forces.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1. The first was that famous captain, the noble Captain



<P>Credence.&nbsp; His were the red colours, and Mr. Promise bare



<P>them; and for a scutcheon he had the holy lamb and golden



<P>shield; and he had ten thousand men at his feet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2. The second was that famous captain, the Captain Good-Hope.



<P>His were the blue colours; his standard-bearer was Mr.



<P>Expectation, and for his scutcheon he had the three golden



<P>anchors; and he had ten thousand men at his feet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3. The third was that valiant captain, the Captain Charity.



<P>His standard-bearer was Mr. Pitiful: his were the green



<P>colours, and for his scutcheon he had three naked orphans



<P>embraced in the bosom; and he had ten thousand men at his



<P>feet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>4. The fourth was that gallant commander, the Captain



<P>Innocent.&nbsp; His standard-bearer was Mr. Harmless: his were the



<P>white colours, and for his scutcheon he had the three golden



<P>doves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>5. The fifth was the truly loyal and well-beloved captain,



<P>the Captain Patience.&nbsp; His standard-bearer was Mr. Suffer-



<P>Long: his were the black colours, and for a scutcheon he had



<P>three arrows through the golden heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These were Emmanuel's captains; these their standard-bearers,



<P>their colours, and their scutcheons; and these the men under



<P>their command.&nbsp; So, as was said, the brave Prince took his



<P>march to go to the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Captain Credence led the



<P>van, and Captain Patience brought up the rear; so the other



<P>three, with their men, made up the main body, the Prince



<P>himself riding in his chariot at the head of them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But when they set out for their march, oh, how the trumpets



<P>sounded, their armour glittered, and how the colours waved in



<P>the wind!&nbsp; The Prince's armour was all of gold, and it shone



<P>like the sun in the firmament; the captains' armour was of



<P>proof, and was in appearance like the glittering stars.



<P>There were also some from the court that rode reformades for



<P>the love that they had to the King Shaddai, and for the happy



<P>deliverance of the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emmanuel also, when he had thus set forwards to go to recover



<P>the town of Mansoul, took with him, at the commandment of his



<P>Father, fifty-four battering-rams, and twelve slings to whirl



<P>stones withal.&nbsp; Every one of these was made of pure gold, and



<P>these they carried with them, in the heart and body of their



<P>army, all along as they went to Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So they marched till they came within less than a league of



<P>the town; there they lay till the first four captains came



<P>thither to acquaint them with matters.&nbsp; Then they took their



<P>journey to go to the town of Mansoul, and unto Mansoul they



<P>came; but when the old soldiers that were in the camp saw



<P>that they had new forces to join with, they again gave such a



<P>shout before the walls of the town of Mansoul, that it put



<P>Diabolus into another fright.&nbsp; So they sat down before the



<P>town, not now as the other four captains did, to wit, against



<P>the gates of Mansoul only; but they environed it round on



<P>every side, and beset it behind and before; so that now, let



<P>Mansoul look which way it will, it saw force and power lie in



<P>siege against it.&nbsp; Besides, there were mounts cast up against



<P>it.&nbsp; The Mount Gracious was on the one side, and Mount



<P>Justice was on the other.&nbsp; Further, there were several small



<P>banks and advance-grounds, as Plain-Truth Hill and No-Sin



<P>Banks, where many of the slings were placed against the town.



<P>Upon Mount Gracious were planted four, and upon Mount Justice



<P>were placed as many, and the rest were conveniently placed in



<P>several parts round about the town.&nbsp; Five of the best



<P>battering-rams, that is, of the biggest of them, were placed



<P>upon Mount Hearken, a mount cast up hard by Ear-gate, with



<P>intent to break that open.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now when the men of the town saw the multitude of the



<P>soldiers that were come up against the place, and the rams



<P>and slings, and the mounts on which they were planted,



<P>together with the glittering of the armour and the waving of



<P>their colours, they were forced to shift, and shift, and



<P>again to shift their thoughts; but they hardly changed for



<P>thoughts more stout, but rather for thoughts more faint; for



<P>though before they thought themselves sufficiently guarded,



<P>yet now they began to think that no man knew what would be



<P>their hap or lot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the good Prince Emmanuel had thus beleaguered Mansoul,



<P>in the first place he hangs out the white flag, which he



<P>caused to be set up among the golden slings that were planted



<P>upon Mount Gracious.&nbsp; And this he did for two reasons: 1. To



<P>give notice to Mansoul that he could and would yet be



<P>gracious if they turned to him.&nbsp; 2. And that he might leave



<P>them the more without excuse, should he destroy them, they



<P>continuing in their rebellion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So the white flag, with the three golden doves in it, was



<P>hung out for two days together, to give them time and space



<P>to consider; but they, as was hinted before, as if they were



<P>unconcerned, made no reply to the favourable signal of the



<P>Prince.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then he commanded, and they set the red flag upon that mount



<P>called Mount Justice.&nbsp; It was the red flag of Captain



<P>Judgment, whose scutcheon was the burning fiery furnace; and



<P>this also stood waving before them in the wind for several



<P>days together.&nbsp; But look how they carried it under the white



<P>flag, when that was hung out, so did they also when the red



<P>one was; and yet he took no advantage of them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then he commanded again that his servants should hang out the



<P>black flag of defiance against them, whose scutcheon was the



<P>three burning thunderbolts; but as unconcerned was Mansoul at



<P>this as at those that went before.&nbsp; But when the Prince saw



<P>that neither mercy nor judgment, nor execution of judgment,



<P>would or could come near the heart of Mansoul, he was touched



<P>with much compunction, and said, 'Surely this strange



<P>carriage of the town of Mansoul doth rather arise from



<P>ignorance of the manner and feats of war, than from a secret



<P>defiance of us, and abhorrence of their own lives; or if they



<P>know the manner of the war of their own, yet not the rites



<P>and ceremonies of the wars in which we are concerned, when I



<P>make wars upon mine enemy Diabolus.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Therefore he sent to the town of Mansoul, to let them know



<P>what he meant by those signs and ceremonies of the flag; and



<P>also to know of them which of the things they would choose,



<P>whether grace and mercy, or judgment and the execution of



<P>judgment.&nbsp; All this while they kept their gates shut with



<P>locks, bolts, and bars, as fast as they could.&nbsp; Their guards



<P>also were doubled, and their watch made as strong as they



<P>could.&nbsp; Diabolus also did pluck up what heart he could, to



<P>encourage the town to make resistance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The townsmen also made answer to the Prince's messenger, in



<P>substance according to that which follows:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Great Sir, - As to what, by your messenger, you have



<P>signified to us, whether we will accept of your mercy, or



<P>fall by your justice, we are bound by the law and custom of



<P>this place, and can give you no positive answer; for it is



<P>against the law, government, and the prerogative royal of our



<P>king, to make either peace or war without him.&nbsp; But this we



<P>will do, - we will petition that our prince will come down to



<P>the wall, and there give you such treatment as he shall think



<P>fit and profitable for us.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the good Prince Emmanuel heard this answer, and saw the



<P>slavery and bondage of the people, and how much content they



<P>were to abide in the chains of the tyrant Diabolus, it



<P>grieved him at the heart; and, indeed, when at any time he



<P>perceived that any were contented under the slavery of the



<P>giant, he would be affected with it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But to return again to our purpose.&nbsp; After the town had



<P>carried this news to Diabolus, and had told him, moreover,



<P>that the Prince, that lay in the leaguer without the wall,



<P>waited upon them for an answer, he refused, and huffed as



<P>well as he could; but in heart he was afraid.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said he, 'I will go down to the gates myself, and give



<P>him such an answer as I think fit.'&nbsp; So he went down to



<P>Mouth-gate, and there addressed himself to speak to Emmanuel,



<P>(but in such language as the town understood not,) the



<P>contents whereof were as follows:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'O thou great Emmanuel, Lord of all the world, I know thee,



<P>that thou art the Son of the great Shaddai!&nbsp; Wherefore art



<P>thou come to torment me, and to cast me out of my possession?



<P>This town of Mansoul, as thou very well knowest, is mine, and



<P>that by a twofold right. 1. It is mine by right of conquest;



<P>I won it in the open field; and shall the prey be taken from



<P>the mighty, or the lawful captive be delivered?&nbsp; 2. This town



<P>of Mansoul is mine also by their subjection.&nbsp; They have



<P>opened the gates of their town unto me; they have sworn



<P>fidelity to me, and have openly chosen me to be their king;



<P>they have also given their castle into my hands; yea, they



<P>have put the whole strength of Mansoul under me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Moreover, this town of Mansoul hath disavowed thee, yea,



<P>they have cast thy law, thy name, thy image, and all that is



<P>thine, behind their back, and have accepted and set up in



<P>their room my law, my name, my image, and all that ever is



<P>mine.&nbsp; Ask else thy captains, and they will tell thee that



<P>Mansoul hath, in answer to all their summonses, shown love



<P>and loyalty to me, but always disdain, despite, contempt, and



<P>scorn to thee and thine.&nbsp; Now, thou art the Just One and the



<P>Holy, and shouldest do no iniquity.&nbsp; Depart, then, I pray



<P>thee, therefore, from me, and leave me to my just inheritance



<P>peaceably.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This oration was made in the language of Diabolus himself;



<P>for although he can, to every man, speak in their own



<P>language, (else he could not tempt them all as he does,) yet



<P>he has a language proper to himself, and it is the language



<P>of the infernal cave, or black pit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wherefore the town of Mansoul (poor hearts!) understood him



<P>not; nor did they see how he crouched and cringed while he



<P>stood before Emmanuel, their Prince.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Yea, they all this while took him to be one of that power and



<P>force that by no means could be resisted.&nbsp; Wherefore, while



<P>he was thus entreating that he might have yet his residence



<P>there, and that Emmanuel would not take it from him by force,



<P>the inhabitants boasted even of his valour, saying, 'Who is



<P>able to make war with him?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, when this pretended king had made an end of what he



<P>would say, Emmanuel, the golden Prince, stood up and spake;



<P>the contents of whose words follow:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Thou deceiving one,' said he, 'I have, in my Father's name,



<P>in mine own name, and on the behalf and for the good of this



<P>wretched town of Mansoul, somewhat to say unto thee.&nbsp; Thou



<P>pretendest a right, a lawful right, to the deplorable town of



<P>Mansoul, when it is most apparent to all my Father's court



<P>that the entrance which thou hast obtained in at the gates of



<P>Mansoul was through thy lie and falsehood; thou beliedst my



<P>Father, thou beliedst his law, and so deceivedst the people



<P>of Mansoul.&nbsp; Thou pretendest that the people have accepted



<P>thee for their king, their captain, and right liege lord; but



<P>that also was by the exercise of deceit and guile.&nbsp; Now, if



<P>lying, wiliness, sinful craft, and all manner of horrible



<P>hypocrisy, will go in my Father's court (in which court thou



<P>must be tried) for equity and right, then will I confess unto



<P>thee that thou hast made a lawful conquest.&nbsp; But, alas! what



<P>thief, what tyrant, what devil is there that may not conquer



<P>after this sort?&nbsp; But I can make it appear, O Diabolus, that



<P>thou, in all thy pretences to a conquest of Mansoul, hast



<P>nothing of truth to say.&nbsp; Thinkest thou this to be right,



<P>that that didst put the lie upon my Father, and madest him



<P>(to Mansoul) the greatest deluder in the world?&nbsp; And what



<P>sayest thou to thy perverting knowingly the right purport and



<P>intent of the law?&nbsp; Was it good also that thou madest a prey



<P>of the innocency and simplicity of the now miserable town of



<P>Mansoul?&nbsp; Yea, thou didst overcome Mansoul by promising to



<P>them happiness in their transgressions against my Father's



<P>law, when thou knewest, and couldest not but know, hadst thou



<P>consulted nothing but thine own experience, that that was the



<P>way to undo them.&nbsp; Thou hast also thyself, O thou master of



<P>enmity, of spite defaced my Father's image in Mansoul, and



<P>set up thy own in its place, to the great contempt of my



<P>Father, the heightening of thy sin, and to the intolerable



<P>damage of the perishing town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Thou hast, moreover, (as if all these were but little things



<P>with thee,) not only deluded and undone this place, but, by



<P>thy lies and fradulent carriage, hast set them against their



<P>own deliverance.&nbsp; How hast thou stirred them up against my



<P>Father's captains, and made them to fight against those that



<P>were sent of him to deliver them from their bondage!&nbsp; All



<P>these things, and very many more, thou hast done against thy



<P>light, and in contempt of my Father and of his law, yea, and



<P>with design to bring under his displeasure for ever the



<P>miserable town of Mansoul.&nbsp; I am therefore come to avenge the



<P>wrong that thou hast done to my Father, and to deal with thee



<P>for the blasphemies wherewith thou hast made poor Mansoul



<P>blaspheme his name.&nbsp; Yea, upon thy head, thou prince of the



<P>infernal cave, will I requite it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'As for myself, O Diabolus, I am come against thee by lawful



<P>power, and to take, by strength of hand, this town of Mansoul



<P>out of thy burning fingers; for this town of Mansoul is mine,



<P>O Diabolus, and that by undoubted right, as all shall see



<P>that will diligently search the most ancient and most



<P>authentic records, and I will plead my title to it, to the



<P>confusion of thy face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'First, for the town of Mansoul, my Father built and did



<P>fashion it with his hand.&nbsp; The palace also that is in the



<P>midst of that town, he built it for his own delight.&nbsp; This



<P>town of Mansoul, therefore, is my Father's, and that by the



<P>best of titles, and he that gainsays the truth of this must



<P>lie against his soul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Secondly, O thou master of the lie, this town of Mansoul is



<P>mine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'1. For that I am my Father's heir, his firstborn, and the



<P>only delight of his heart.&nbsp; I am therefore come up against



<P>thee in mine own right, even to recover mine own inheritance



<P>out of thine hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'2. But further, as I have a right and title to Mansoul by



<P>being my Father's heir, so I have also by my Father's



<P>donation.&nbsp; His it was, and he gave it me; nor have I at any



<P>time offended my Father, that he should take it from me, and



<P>give it to thee.&nbsp; Nor have I been forced, by playing the



<P>bankrupt, to sell or set to sale to thee my beloved town of



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; Mansoul is my desire, my delight, and the joy of my



<P>heart.&nbsp; But,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'3. Mansoul is mine by right of purchase.&nbsp; I have bought it,



<P>O Diabolus, I have bought it to myself.&nbsp; Now, since it was my



<P>Father's and mine, as I was his heir, and since also I have



<P>made it mine by virtue of a great purchase, it followeth



<P>that, by all lawful right, the town of Mansoul is mine, and



<P>that thou art an usurper, a tyrant, and traitor, in thy



<P>holding possession thereof.&nbsp; Now, the cause of my purchasing



<P>of it was this: Mansoul had trespassed against my Father; now



<P>my Father had said, that in the day that they broke his law



<P>they should die.&nbsp; Now, it is more possible for heaven and



<P>earth to pass away than for my Father to break his word.



<P>Wherefore when Mansoul had sinned indeed by hearkening to thy



<P>lie, I put in and became a surety to my Father, body for



<P>body, and soul for soul, that I would make amends for



<P>Mansoul's transgressions, and my Father did accept thereof.



<P>So, when the time appointed was come, I gave body for body,



<P>soul for soul, life for life, blood for blood, and so



<P>redeemed my beloved Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'4. Nor did I do this by halves: my Father's law and justice,



<P>that were both concerned in the threatening upon



<P>transgression, are both now satisfied, and very well content



<P>that Mansoul should be delivered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'5. Nor am I come out this day against thee, but by



<P>commandment of my Father; it was he that said unto me, "Go



<P>down and deliver Mansoul."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Wherefore be it known unto thee, O thou fountain of deceit,



<P>and be it also known to the foolish town of Mansoul, that I



<P>am not come against thee this day without my Father.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And now,' said the golden-headed Prince, 'I have a word to



<P>the town of Mansoul.'&nbsp; But so soon as mention was made that



<P>he had a word to speak to the besotted town of Mansoul, the



<P>gates were double-guarded, and all men commanded not to give



<P>him audience.&nbsp; So he proceeded and said, 'O unhappy town of



<P>Mansoul, I cannot but be touched with pity and compassion for



<P>thee.&nbsp; Thou hast accepted of Diabolus for thy king, and art



<P>become a nurse and minister of Diabolonians against thy



<P>sovereign Lord.&nbsp; Thy gates thou hast opened to him, but hast



<P>shut them fast against me; thou hast given him an hearing,



<P>but hast stopped thine ears at my cry.&nbsp; He brought to thee



<P>thy destruction, and thou didst receive both him and it: I am



<P>come to thee bringing salvation, but thou regardest me not.



<P>Besides, thou hast, as with sacrilegious hands, taken



<P>thyself, with all that was mine in thee, and hast given all



<P>to my foe, and to the greatest enemy my Father has.&nbsp; You have



<P>bowed and subjected yourselves to him, you have vowed and



<P>sworn yourselves to be his.&nbsp; Poor Mansoul! what shall I do



<P>unto thee?&nbsp; Shall I save thee? - shall I destroy thee?&nbsp; What



<P>shall I do unto thee?&nbsp; Shall I fall upon thee, and grind thee



<P>to powder, or make thee a monument of the richest grace?



<P>What shall I do unto thee?&nbsp; Hearken, therefore, thou town of



<P>Mansoul, hearken to my word, and thou shalt live.&nbsp; I am



<P>merciful, Mansoul, and thou shalt find me so: shut me not out



<P>of thy gates.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'O Mansoul, neither is my commission nor inclination at all



<P>to do thee hurt.&nbsp; Why fliest thou so fast from thy friend,



<P>and stickest so close to thine enemy?&nbsp; Indeed, I would have



<P>thee, because it becomes thee to be sorry for thy sin, but do



<P>not despair of life; this great force is not to hurt thee,



<P>but to deliver thee from thy bondage, and to reduce thee to



<P>thy obedience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'My commission, indeed, is to make a war upon Diabolus thy



<P>king, and upon all Diabolonians with him; for he is the



<P>strong man armed that keeps the house, and I will have him



<P>out: his spoils I must divide, his armour I must take from



<P>him, his hold I must cast him out of, and must make it a



<P>habitation for myself.&nbsp; And this, O Mansoul, shall Diabolus



<P>know when he shall be made to follow me in chains, and when



<P>Mansoul shall rejoice to see it so.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;'I could, would I now put forth my might, cause that



<P>forthwith he should leave you and depart; but I have it in my



<P>heart so to deal with him, as that the justice of the war



<P>that I shall make upon him may be seen and acknowledged by



<P>all.&nbsp; He hath taken Mansoul by fraud, and keeps it by



<P>violence and deceit, and I will make him bare and naked in



<P>the eyes of all observers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'All my words are true.&nbsp; I am mighty to save, and will



<P>deliver my Mansoul out of his hand.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This speech was intended chiefly for Mansoul, but Mansoul



<P>would not have the hearing of it.&nbsp; They shut up Ear-gate,



<P>they barricaded it up, they kept it locked and bolted, they



<P>set a guard thereat, and commanded that no Mansoulonian



<P>should go out to him, nor that any from the camp should be



<P>admitted into the town.&nbsp; All this they did, so horribly had



<P>Diabolus enchanted them to do, and seek to do for him,



<P>against their rightful Lord and Prince; wherefore no man, nor



<P>voice, nor sound of man that belonged to the glorious host,



<P>was to come into the town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So when Emmanuel saw that Mansoul was thus involved in sin,



<P>he calls his army together, (since now also his words were



<P>despised,) and gave out a commandment throughout all his host



<P>to be ready against the time appointed.&nbsp; Now, forasmuch as



<P>there was no way lawfully to take the town of Mansoul but to



<P>get in by the gates, and at Ear-gate as the chief, therefore



<P>he commanded his captains and commanders to bring their rams,



<P>their slings and their men, and place them at Eye-gate and



<P>Ear-gate, in order to his taking the town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Emmanuel had put all things in a readiness to give



<P>Diabolus battle, he sent again to know of the town of



<P>Mansoul, if in peaceable manner they would yield themselves,



<P>or whether they were yet resolved to put him to try the



<P>utmost extremity?&nbsp; They then, together with Diabolus their



<P>king, called a council of war, and resolved upon certain



<P>propositions that should be offered to Emmanuel, if he will



<P>accept thereof, so they agreed; and then the next was, who



<P>should be sent on this errand.&nbsp; Now, there was in the town of



<P>Mansoul an old man, a Diabolonian, and his name was Mr. Loth-



<P>to-stoop, a stiff man in his way, and a great doer for



<P>Diabolus; him, therefore, they sent, and put into his mouth



<P>what he should say.&nbsp; So he went and came to the camp to



<P>Emmanuel, and when he was come, a time was appointed to give



<P>him audience.&nbsp; So at the time he came, and after a



<P>Diabolonian ceremony or two, he thus began and said, 'Great



<P>sir, that it may be known unto all men how good-natured a



<P>prince my master is, he has sent me to tell your lordship



<P>that he is very willing, rather than go to war, to deliver up



<P>into your hands one half of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; I am



<P>therefore to know if your Mightiness will accept of this



<P>proposition.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Emmanuel, 'The whole is mine by gift and purchase,



<P>wherefore I will never lose one half.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Mr. Loth-to-stoop, 'Sir, my master hath said that



<P>he will be content that you shall be the nominal and titular



<P>Lord of all, if he may possess but a part.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then Emmanuel answered, 'The whole is mine really, not in



<P>name and word only; wherefore I will be the sole lord and



<P>possessor of all, or of none at all, of Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then Mr. Loth-to-stoop said again, 'Sir, behold the



<P>condescension of my master!&nbsp; He says, that he will be



<P>content, if he may but have assigned to him some place in



<P>Mansoul as a place to live privately in, and you shall be



<P>Lord of all the rest.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the golden Prince, 'All that the Father giveth me



<P>shall come to me; and of all that he giveth me I will lose



<P>nothing - no, not a hoof nor a hair.&nbsp; I will not, therefore,



<P>grant him, no, not the least corner of Mansoul to dwell in; I



<P>will have all to myself.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then Loth-to-stoop said again, 'But, sir, suppose that my



<P>Lord should resign the whole town to you, only with this



<P>proviso, that he sometimes, when he comes into this country,



<P>may, for old acquaintance' sake, be entertained as a



<P>wayfaring man for two days, or ten days or a month, or so.



<P>May not this small matter be granted?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Emmanuel, 'No.&nbsp; He came as a wayfaring man to



<P>David, nor did he stay long with him, and yet it had like to



<P>have cost David his soul.&nbsp; I will not consent that he ever



<P>should have any harbour more there.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Mr. Loth-to-stoop, 'Sir, you seem to be very hard.



<P>Suppose my master should yield to all that your lordship hath



<P>said, provided that his friends and kindred in Mansoul may



<P>have liberty to trade in the town, and to enjoy their present



<P>dwellings.&nbsp; May not that be granted, sir?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Emmanuel, 'No; that is contrary to my Father's



<P>will; for all, and all manner of Diabolonians that now are,



<P>or that at any time shall be found in Mansoul, shall not only



<P>lose their lands and liberties, but also their lives.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Mr. Loth-to-stoop again, 'But, sir, may not my



<P>master and great lord, by letters, by passengers, by



<P>accidental opportunities, and the like, maintain, if he shall



<P>deliver up all unto thee, some kind of old friendship with



<P>Mansoul?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emmanuel answered, 'No, by no means; forasmuch as any such



<P>fellowship, friendship, intimacy, or acquaintance, in what



<P>way, sort, or mode soever maintained, will tend to the



<P>corrupting of Mansoul, the alienating of their affections



<P>from me, and the endangering of their peace with my Father.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Loth-to-stoop yet added further, saying, 'But, great sir,



<P>since my master hath many friends, and those that are dear to



<P>him, in Mansoul, may he not, if he shall depart from them,



<P>even of his bounty and good-nature, bestow upon them, as he



<P>sees fit, some tokens of his love and kindness that he had



<P>for them, to the end that Mansoul, when he is gone, may look



<P>upon such tokens of kindness once received from their old



<P>friend, and remember him who was once their king, and the



<P>merry times that they sometimes enjoyed one with another,



<P>while he and they lived in peace together?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Emmanuel, 'No; for if Mansoul come to be mine, I



<P>shall not admit of nor consent that there should be the least



<P>scrap, shred, or dust of Diabolus left behind, as tokens of



<P>gifts bestowed upon any in Mansoul, thereby to call to



<P>remembrance the horrible communion that was betwixt them and



<P>him.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, sir,' said Mr. Loth-to-stoop, 'I have one thing more



<P>to propound, and then I am got to the end of my commission.



<P>Suppose that, when my master is gone from Mansoul, any that



<P>shall yet live in the town should have such business of high



<P>concerns to do, that if they be neglected the party shall be



<P>undone; and suppose, sir, that nobody can help in that case



<P>so well as my master and lord, may not now my master be sent



<P>for upon so urgent an occasion as this?&nbsp; Or if he may not be



<P>admitted into the town, may not he and the person concerned



<P>meet in some of the villages near Mansoul, and there lay



<P>their heads together, and there consult of matters?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was the last of those ensnaring propositions that Mr.



<P>Loth-to-stoop had to propound to Emmanuel on behalf of his



<P>master Diabolus; but Emmanuel would not grant it; for he



<P>said, 'There can be no case, or thing, or matter fall out in



<P>Mansoul, when thy master shall be gone, that may not be



<P>solved by my Father; besides, it will be a great



<P>disparagement to my Father's wisdom and skill to admit any



<P>from Mansoul to go out to Diabolus for advice, when they are



<P>bid before, in everything, by prayer and supplication to let



<P>their requests be made known to my Father.&nbsp; Further, this,



<P>should it be granted, would be to grant that a door should be



<P>set open for Diabolus, and the Diabolonians in Mansoul, to



<P>hatch, and plot, and bring to pass treasonable designs, to



<P>the grief of my Father and me, and to the utter destruction



<P>of Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Mr. Loth-to-stoop had heard this answer, he took his



<P>leave of Emmanuel, and departed, saying that he would carry



<P>word to his master concerning this whole affair.&nbsp; So he



<P>departed, and came to Diabolus to Mansoul, and told him the



<P>whole of the matter, and how Emmanuel would not admit, no,



<P>not by any means, that he, when he was once gone out, should



<P>for ever have anything more to do either in, or with any that



<P>are of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; When Mansoul and Diabolus had



<P>heard this relation of things, they with one consent



<P>concluded to use their best endeavour to keep Emmanuel out of



<P>Mansoul, and sent old Ill-Pause, of whom you have heard



<P>before, to tell the Prince and his captains so.&nbsp; So the old



<P>gentleman came up to the top of Ear-gate, and called to the



<P>camp for a hearing, who when they gave audience, he said, 'I



<P>have in commandment from my high lord to bid you tell it to



<P>your Prince Emmanuel, that Mansoul and their king are



<P>resolved to stand and fall together; and that it is in vain



<P>for your Prince to think of ever having Mansoul in his hand,



<P>unless he can take it by force.'&nbsp; So some went and told to



<P>Emmanuel what old Ill-Pause, a Diabolonian in Mansoul, had



<P>said.&nbsp; Then said the Prince, 'I must try the power of my



<P>sword, for I will not (for all the rebellions and repulses



<P>that Mansoul has made against me) raise my siege and depart,



<P>but will assuredly take my Mansoul, and deliver it from the



<P>hand of her enemy.'&nbsp; And with that he gave out a commandment



<P>that Captain Boanerges, Captain Conviction, Captain Judgment,



<P>and Captain Execution should forthwith march up to Ear-gate



<P>with trumpets sounding, colours flying, and with shouting for



<P>the battle.&nbsp; Also he would that Captain Credence should join



<P>himself with them.&nbsp; Emmanuel, moreover, gave order that



<P>Captain Good-Hope and Captain Charity should draw themselves



<P>up before Eye-gate.&nbsp; He bid also that the rest of his



<P>captains and their men should place themselves for the best



<P>of their advantage against the enemy round about the town;



<P>and all was done as he had commanded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then he bid that the word should be given forth, and the word



<P>was at that time, 'EMMANUEL.'&nbsp; Then was an alarm sounded, and



<P>the battering-rams were played, and the slings did whirl



<P>stones into the town amain, and thus the battle began.&nbsp; Now



<P>Diabolus himself did manage the townsmen in the war, and that



<P>at every gate; wherefore their resistance was the more



<P>forcible, hellish, and offensive to Emmanuel.&nbsp; Thus was the



<P>good Prince engaged and entertained by Diabolus and Mansoul



<P>for several days together; and a sight worth seeing it was to



<P>behold how the captains of Shaddai behaved themselves in this



<P>war.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And first for Captain Boanerges, (not to under-value the



<P>rest,) he made three most fierce assaults, one after another,



<P>upon Ear-gate, to the shaking of the posts thereof.&nbsp; Captain



<P>Conviction, he also made up as fast with Boanerges as



<P>possibly he could, and both discerning that the gate began to



<P>yield, they commanded that the rams should still be played



<P>against it.&nbsp; Now, Captain Conviction, going up very near to



<P>the gate, was with great force driven back, and received



<P>three wounds in the mouth.&nbsp; And those that rode reformades,



<P>they went about to encourage the captains.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the valour of the two captains, made mention of before,



<P>the Prince sent for them to his pavilion, and commanded that



<P>a while they should rest themselves, and that with somewhat



<P>they should be refreshed.&nbsp; Care also was taken for Captain



<P>Conviction, that he should be healed of his wounds.&nbsp; The



<P>Prince also gave to each of them a chain of gold, and bid



<P>them yet be of good courage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nor did Captain Good-Hope nor Captain Charity come behind in



<P>this most desperate fight, for they so well did behave



<P>themselves at Eye-gate, that they had almost broken it quite



<P>open.&nbsp; These also had a reward from their Prince, as also had



<P>the rest of the captains, because they did valiantly round



<P>about the town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In this engagement several of the officers of Diabolus were



<P>slain, and some of the townsmen wounded.&nbsp; For the officers,



<P>there was one Captain Boasting slain.&nbsp; This Boasting thought



<P>that nobody could have shaken the posts of Ear-gate, nor have



<P>shaken the heart of Diabolus.&nbsp; Next to him there was one



<P>Captain Secure slain: this Secure used to say that the blind



<P>and lame in Mansoul were able to keep the gates of the town



<P>against Emmanuel's army.&nbsp; This Captain Secure did Captain



<P>Conviction cleave down the head with a two-handed sword, when



<P>he received himself three wounds in his mouth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Besides these there was one Captain Bragman, a very desperate



<P>fellow, and he was captain over a band of those that threw



<P>firebrands, arrows, and death: he also received, by the hand



<P>of Captain Good-Hope at Eye-gate, a mortal wound in the



<P>breast.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was, moreover, one Mr. Feeling; but he was no captain,



<P>but a great stickler to encourage Mansoul to rebellion.&nbsp; He



<P>received a wound in the eye by the hand of one of Boanerges'



<P>soldiers, and had by the captain himself been slain, but that



<P>he made a sudden retreat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But I never saw Willbewill so daunted in all my life; he was



<P>not able to do as he was wont, and some say that he also



<P>received a wound in the leg, and that some of the men in the



<P>Prince's army have certainly seen him limp as he afterwards



<P>walked on the wall.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I shall not give you a particular account of the names of the



<P>soldiers that were slain in the town, for many were maimed,



<P>and wounded, and slain; for when they saw that the posts of



<P>Ear-gate did shake, and Eye-gate was well-nigh broken quite



<P>open, and also that their captains were slain, this took away



<P>the hearts of many of the Diabolonians; they fell also by the



<P>force of the shot that were sent by the golden slings into



<P>the midst of the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of the townsmen, there was one Love-no-Good; he was a



<P>townsman, but a Diabolonian; he also received his mortal



<P>wound in Mansoul, but he died not very soon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Ill-Pause also, who was the man that came along with



<P>Diabolus when at first he attempted the taking of Mansoul, he



<P>also received a grievous wound in the head; some say that his



<P>brain-pan was cracked.&nbsp; This I have taken notice of, that he



<P>was never after this able to do that mischief to Mansoul as



<P>he had done in times past.&nbsp; Also old Prejudice and Mr.



<P>Anything fled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when the battle was over, the Prince commanded that yet



<P>once more the white flag should be set upon Mount Gracious in



<P>sight of the town of Mansoul, to show that yet Emmanuel had



<P>grace for the wretched town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Diabolus saw the white flag hung out again, and knowing



<P>that it was not for him, but Mansoul, he cast in his mind to



<P>play another prank, to wit, to see if Emmanuel would raise



<P>his siege and begone, upon promise of reformation.&nbsp; So he



<P>comes down to the gate one evening, a good while after the



<P>sun was gone down, and calls to speak with Emmanuel, who



<P>presently came down to the gate, and Diabolus saith unto him:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Forasmuch as thou makest it appear by thy white flag that



<P>thou art wholly given to peace and quiet, I thought meet to



<P>acquaint thee that we are ready to accept thereof upon terms



<P>which thou mayest admit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I know that thou art given to devotion, and that holiness



<P>pleaseth thee; yea, that thy great end in making a war upon



<P>Mansoul is, that it may be a holy habitation.&nbsp; Well, draw off



<P>thy forces from the town, and I will bend Mansoul to thy bow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'First, I will lay down all acts of hostility against thee,



<P>and will be willing to become thy deputy, and will, as I have



<P>formerly been against thee, now serve thee in the town of



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; And more particularly,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'1. I will persuade Mansoul to receive thee for their Lord;



<P>and I know that they will do it the sooner when they shall



<P>understand that I am thy deputy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'2. I will show them wherein they have erred, and that



<P>transgression stands in the way to life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'3. I will show them the holy law unto which they must



<P>conform, even that which they have broken.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'4. I will press upon them the necessity of a reformation



<P>according to thy law.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'5. And, moreover, that none of these things may fail, I



<P>myself, at my own proper cost and charge, will set up and



<P>maintain a sufficient ministry, besides lectures, in Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'6. Thou shalt receive, as a token of our subjection to thee,



<P>year by year, what thou shalt think fit to lay and levy upon



<P>us in token of our subjection to thee.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Emmanuel to him, 'O full of deceit, how movable are



<P>thy ways!&nbsp; How often hast thou changed and rechanged, if so



<P>be thou mightest still keep possession of my Mansoul, though,



<P>as has been plainly declared before, I am the right heir



<P>thereof!&nbsp; Often hast thou made thy proposals already, nor is



<P>this last a whit better than they.&nbsp; And failing to deceive



<P>when thou showedst thyself in thy black, thou hast now



<P>transformed thyself into an angel of light, and wouldst, to



<P>deceive, be now as a minister of righteousness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But know thou, O Diabolus, that nothing must be regarded



<P>that thou canst propound, for nothing is done by thee but to



<P>deceive.&nbsp; Thou neither hast conscience to God, nor love to



<P>the town of Mansoul; whence, then, should these thy sayings



<P>arise but from sinful craft and deceit?&nbsp; He that can of list



<P>and will propound what he pleases, and that wherewith he may



<P>destroy them that believe him, is to be abandoned, with all



<P>that he shall say.&nbsp; But if righteousness be such a beauty-



<P>spot in thine eyes now, how is it that wickedness was so



<P>closely stuck to by thee before?&nbsp; But this is by-the-bye.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Thou talkest now of a reformation in Mansoul, and that thou



<P>thyself, if I will please, wilt be at the head of that



<P>reformation; all the while knowing that the greatest



<P>proficiency that man can make in the law, and the



<P>righteousness thereof, will amount to no more, for the taking



<P>away of the curse from Mansoul, than just nothing at all; for



<P>a law being broken by Mansoul, that had before, upon a



<P>supposition of the breach thereof, a curse pronounced against



<P>him for it of God, can never, by his obeying of the law,



<P>deliver himself therefrom (to say nothing of what a



<P>reformation is like to be set up in Mansoul when the devil is



<P>become corrector of vice).&nbsp; Thou knowest that all that thou



<P>hast now said in this matter is nothing but guile and deceit;



<P>and is, as it was the first, so is it the last card that thou



<P>hast to play.&nbsp; Many there be that do soon discern thee when



<P>thou showest them thy cloven foot; but in thy white, thy



<P>light, and in thy transformation, thou art seen but of a few.



<P>But thou shalt not do thus with my Mansoul, O Diabolus; for I



<P>do still love my Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Besides, I am not come to put Mansoul upon works to live



<P>thereby; should I do so, I should be like unto thee: but I am



<P>come that by me, and by what I have and shall do for Mansoul,



<P>they may to my Father be reconciled, though by their sin they



<P>have provoked him to anger, and though by the law they cannot



<P>obtain mercy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Thou talkest of subjecting of this town to good, when none



<P>desireth it at thy hands.&nbsp; I am sent by my Father to possess



<P>it myself, and to guide it by the skilfulness of my hands



<P>into such a conformity to him as shall be pleasing in his



<P>sight.&nbsp; I will therefore possess it myself; I will dispossess



<P>and cast thee out; I will set up mine own standard in the



<P>midst of them; I will also govern them by new laws, new



<P>officers, new motives, and new ways; yea, I will pull down



<P>this town, and build it again; and it shall be as though it



<P>had not been, and it shall then be the glory of the whole



<P>universe.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Diabolus heard this, and perceived that he was



<P>discovered in all his deceits, he was confounded, and utterly



<P>put to a nonplus; but having in himself the fountain of



<P>iniquity, rage, and malice against both Shaddai and his Son,



<P>and the beloved town of Mansoul, what doth he but strengthen



<P>himself what he could to give fresh battle to the noble



<P>Prince Emmanuel?&nbsp; So, then, now we must have another fight



<P>before the town of Mansoul is taken.&nbsp; Come up, then, to the



<P>mountains, you that love to see military actions, and behold



<P>by both sides how the fatal blow is given, while one seeks to



<P>hold, and the other seeks to make himself master of the



<P>famous town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Diabolus, therefore, having withdrawn himself from the wall



<P>to his force that was in the heart of the town of Mansoul,



<P>Emmanuel also returned to the camp; and both of them, after



<P>their divers ways, put themselves into a posture fit to give



<P>battle one to another.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Diabolus, as filled with despair of retaining in his hands



<P>the famous town of Mansoul, resolved to do what mischief he



<P>could (if, indeed, he could do any) to the army of the Prince



<P>and to the famous town of Mansoul; for, alas! it was not the



<P>happiness of the silly town of Mansoul that was designed by



<P>Diabolus, but the utter ruin and overthrow thereof, as now is



<P>enough in view.&nbsp; Wherefore, he commands his officers that



<P>they should then, when they see that they could hold the town



<P>no longer, do it what harm and mischief they could, rendering



<P>and tearing men, women, and children.&nbsp; 'For,' said he, 'we



<P>had better quite demolish the place, and leave it like a



<P>ruinous heap, than so leave it that it may be an habitation



<P>for Emmanuel.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emmanuel again, knowing that the next battle would issue in



<P>his being made master of the place, gave out a royal



<P>commandment to all his officers, high captains, and men of



<P>war, to be sure to show themselves men of war against



<P>Diabolus and all Diabolonians; but favourable, merciful, and



<P>meek to the old inhabitants of Mansoul.&nbsp; 'Bend, therefore,'



<P>said the noble Prince, 'the hottest front of the battle



<P>against Diabolus and his men.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So the day being come, the command was given, and the



<P>Prince's men did bravely stand to their arms, and did, as



<P>before, bend their main force against Ear-gate and Eye-gate.



<P>The word was then, 'Mansoul is won!' so they made their



<P>assault upon the town.&nbsp; Diabolus also, as fast as he could,



<P>with the main of his power, made resistance from within; and



<P>his high lords and chief captains for a time fought very



<P>cruelly against the Prince's army.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But after three or four notable charges by the Prince and his



<P>noble captains, Ear-gate was broken open, and the bars and



<P>bolts wherewith it was used to be fast shut up against the



<P>Prince, were broken into a thousand pieces.&nbsp; Then did the



<P>Prince's trumpets sound, the captains shout, the town shake,



<P>and Diabolus retreat to his hold.&nbsp; Well, when the Prince's



<P>forces had broken open the gate, himself came up and did set



<P>his throne in it; also he set his standard thereby, upon a



<P>mount that before by his men was cast up to place the mighty



<P>slings thereon.&nbsp; The mount was called Mount Hear-well.



<P>There, therefore, the Prince abode, to wit, hard by the going



<P>in at the gate.&nbsp; He commanded also that the golden slings



<P>should yet be played upon the town, especially against the



<P>castle, because for shelter thither was Diabolus retreated.



<P>Now, from Ear-gate the street was straight even to the house



<P>of Mr. Recorder that so was before Diabolus took the town;



<P>and hard by his house stood the castle, which Diabolus for a



<P>long time had made his irksome den.&nbsp; The captains, therefore,



<P>did quickly clear that street by the use of their slings, so



<P>that way was made up to the heart of the town.&nbsp; Then did the



<P>Prince command that Captain Boanerges, Captain Conviction,



<P>and Captain Judgment, should forthwith march up the town to



<P>the old gentleman's gate.&nbsp; Then did the captains in the most



<P>warlike manner enter into the town of Mansoul, and marching



<P>in with flying colours, they came up to the Recorder's house,



<P>and that was almost as strong as was the castle.&nbsp; Battering-



<P>rams they took also with them, to plant against the castle



<P>gates.&nbsp; When they were come to the house of Mr. Conscience,



<P>they knocked, and demanded entrance.&nbsp; Now, the old gentleman,



<P>not knowing as yet fully their design, kept his gates shut



<P>all the time of this fight.&nbsp; Wherefore Boanerges demanded



<P>entrance at his gates; and no man making answer, he gave it



<P>one stroke with the head of a ram, and this made the old



<P>gentleman shake, and his house to tremble and totter.&nbsp; Then



<P>came Mr. Recorder down to the gates, and, as he could, with



<P>quivering lips he asked who was there?&nbsp; Boanerges answered,



<P>'We are the captains and commanders of the great Shaddai and



<P>of the blessed Emmanuel, his Son, and we demand possession of



<P>your house for the use of our noble Prince.'&nbsp; And with that



<P>the battering-ram gave the gate another shake.&nbsp; This made the



<P>old gentleman tremble the more, yet durst he not but open the



<P>gate: then the King's forces marched in, namely, the three



<P>brave captains mentioned before.&nbsp; Now, the Recorder's house



<P>was a place of much convenience for Emmanuel, not only



<P>because it was near to the castle and strong, but also



<P>because it was large, and fronted the castle, the den where



<P>now Diabolus was, for he was now afraid to come out of his



<P>hold.&nbsp; As for Mr. Recorder, the captains carried it very



<P>reservedly to him; as yet he knew nothing of the great



<P>designs of Emmanuel, so that he did not know what judgment to



<P>make, nor what would be the end of such thundering



<P>beginnings.&nbsp; It was also presently noised in the town how the



<P>Recorder's house was possessed, his rooms taken up, and his



<P>palace made the seat of the war; and no sooner was it noised



<P>abroad, but they took the alarm as warmly, and gave it out to



<P>others of his friends, and you know, as a snowball loses



<P>nothing by rolling, so in little time the whole town was



<P>possessed that they must expect nothing from the Prince but



<P>destruction; and the ground of the business was this, the



<P>Recorder was afraid, the Recorder trembled, and the captains



<P>carried it strangely to the Recorder.&nbsp; So many came to see,



<P>but when they with their own eyes did behold the captains in



<P>the palace, and their battering-rams ever playing at the



<P>castle gates to beat them down, they were riveted in their



<P>fears, and it made them all in amaze.&nbsp; And, as I said, the



<P>man of the house would increase all this; for whoever came to



<P>him, or discoursed with him, nothing would he talk of, tell



<P>them, or hear, but that death and destruction now attended



<P>Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'For,' quoth the old gentleman, 'you are all of you sensible



<P>that we all have been traitors to that once despised, but now



<P>famously victorious and glorious Prince Emmanuel; for he now,



<P>as you see, doth not only lie in close siege about us, but



<P>hath forced his entrance in at our gates.&nbsp; Moreover, Diabolus



<P>flees before him; and he hath, as you behold, made of my



<P>house a garrison against the castle where he is.&nbsp; I, for my



<P>part, have transgressed greatly, and he that is clean, it is



<P>well for him.&nbsp; But I say I have transgressed greatly in



<P>keeping silence when I should have spoken, and in perverting



<P>justice when I should have executed the same.&nbsp; True, I have



<P>suffered something at the hand of Diabolus for taking part



<P>with the laws of King Shaddai; but that, alas! what will that



<P>do? Will that make compensation for the rebellions and



<P>treasons that I have done, and have suffered without



<P>gainsaying to be committed in the town of Mansoul? Oh! I



<P>tremble to think what will be the end of this so dreadful and



<P>so ireful a beginning!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, while these brave captains were thus busy in the house



<P>of the old Recorder, Captain Execution was as busy in other



<P>parts of the town, in securing the back streets and the



<P>walls.&nbsp; He also hunted the Lord Willbewill sorely; he



<P>suffered him not to rest in any corner; he pursued him so



<P>hard that he drove his men from him, and made him glad to



<P>thrust his head into a hole.&nbsp; Also this mighty warrior did



<P>cut three of the Lord Willbewill's officers down to the



<P>ground: one was old Mr. Prejudice, he that had his crown



<P>cracked in the mutiny.&nbsp; This man was made by Lord Willbewill



<P>keeper of the Ear-gate, and fell by the hand of Captain



<P>Execution.&nbsp; There was also one Mr. Backward-to-all-but-



<P>naught, and he also was one of Lord Willbewill's officers,



<P>and was the captain of the two guns that once were mounted on



<P>the top of Ear-gate; he also was cut down to the ground by



<P>the hands of Captain Execution.&nbsp; Besides these two there was



<P>another, a third, and his name was Captain Treacherous; a



<P>vile man this was, but one that Willbewill did put a great



<P>deal of confidence in; but him also did this Captain



<P>Execution cut down to the ground with the rest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He also made a very great slaughter among my Lord



<P>Willbewill's soldiers, killing many that were stout and



<P>sturdy, and wounding many that for Diabolus were nimble and



<P>active.&nbsp; But all these were Diabolonians; there was not a



<P>man, a native of Mansoul, hurt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Other feats of war were also likewise performed by other of



<P>the captains, as at Eye-gate, where Captain Good-Hope and



<P>Captain Charity had a charge, was great execution done; for



<P>the Captain Good-Hope, with his own hands, slew one Captain



<P>Blindfold, the keeper of that gate.&nbsp; This Blindfold was



<P>captain of a thousand men, and they were they that fought



<P>with mauls; he also pursued his men, slew many, and wounded



<P>more, and made the rest hide their heads in corners.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was also at that gate Mr. Ill-Pause, of whom you have



<P>heard before.&nbsp; He was an old man, and had a beard that



<P>reached down to his girdle: the same was he that was orator



<P>to Diabolus: he did much mischief in the town of Mansoul, and



<P>fell by the hand of Captain Good-Hope.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>What shall I say?&nbsp; The Diabolonians in these days lay dead in



<P>every corner, though too many yet were alive in Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, the old Recorder and my Lord Understanding, with some



<P>others of the chief of the town, to wit, such as knew they



<P>must stand and fall with the famous town of Mansoul, came



<P>together upon a day, and after consultation had, did jointly



<P>agree to draw up a petition, and to send it to Emmanuel, now



<P>while he sat in the gate of Mansoul.&nbsp; So they drew up their



<P>petition to Emmanuel, the contents whereof were these: That



<P>they, the old inhabitants of the now deplorable town of



<P>Mansoul, confessed their sin, and were sorry that they had



<P>offended his princely Majesty, and prayed that he would spare



<P>their lives.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Unto this petition he gave no answer at all, and that did



<P>trouble them yet so much the more.&nbsp; Now, all this while the



<P>captains that were in the Recorder's house were playing with



<P>the battering-rams at the gates of the castle, to beat them



<P>down.&nbsp; So after some time, labour, and travail, the gate of



<P>the castle that was called Impregnable was beaten open, and



<P>broken into several splinters, and so a way made to go up to



<P>the hold in which Diabolus had hid himself.&nbsp; Then were



<P>tidings sent down to Ear-gate, for Emmanuel still abode



<P>there, to let him know that a way was made in at the gates of



<P>the castle of Mansoul.&nbsp; But, oh! how the trumpets at the



<P>tidings sounded throughout the Prince's camp, for that now



<P>the war was so near an end, and Mansoul itself of being set



<P>free.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then the Prince arose from the place where he was, and took



<P>with him such of his men of war as were fittest for that



<P>expedition, and marched up the street of Mansoul to the old



<P>Recorder's house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, the Prince himself was clad all in armour of gold, and



<P>so he marched up the town with his standard borne before him;



<P>but he kept his countenance much reserved all the way as he



<P>went, so that the people could not tell how to gather to



<P>themselves love or hatred by his looks.&nbsp; Now, as he marched



<P>up the street, the townsfolk came out at every door to see,



<P>and could not but be taken with his person and the glory



<P>thereof, but wondered at the reservedness of his countenance;



<P>for as yet he spake more to them by his actions and works



<P>than he did by words or smiles.&nbsp; But also poor Mansoul, (as



<P>in such cases all are apt to do,) they interpreted the



<P>carriage of Emmanuel to them as did Joseph's brethren his to



<P>them, even all the quite contrary way.&nbsp; 'For,' thought they,



<P>'if Emmanuel loved us, he would show it to us by word of



<P>carriage; but none of these he doth, therefore Emmanuel hates



<P>us.&nbsp; Now, if Emmanuel hates us, then Mansoul shall be slain,



<P>then Mansoul shall become a dunghill.'&nbsp; They knew that they



<P>had transgressed his Father's law, and that against him they



<P>had been in with Diabolus, his enemy.&nbsp; They also knew that



<P>the Prince Emmanuel knew all this; for they were convinced



<P>that he was an angel of God, to know all things that are done



<P>in the earth; and this made them think that their condition



<P>was miserable, and that the good Prince would make them



<P>desolate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And,' thought they, 'what time so fit to do this in as now,



<P>when he has the bridle of Mansoul in his hand?'&nbsp; And this I



<P>took special notice of, that the inhabitants, notwithstanding



<P>all this, could not - no, they could not, when they see him



<P>march through the town, but cringe, bow, bend, and were ready



<P>to lick the dust of his feet.&nbsp; They also wished a thousand



<P>times over that he would become their Prince and Captain, and



<P>would become their protection.&nbsp; They would also one to



<P>another talk of the comeliness of his person, and how much



<P>for glory and valour he outstripped the great ones of the



<P>world.&nbsp; But, poor hearts, as to themselves, their thoughts



<P>would chance, and go upon all manner of extremes.&nbsp; Yea,



<P>through the working of them backward and forward, Mansoul



<P>became as a ball tossed, and as a rolling thing before the



<P>whirlwind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when he was come to the castle gates, he commanded



<P>Diabolus to appear, and to surrender himself into his hands.



<P>But, oh! how loath was the beast to appear! how he stuck at



<P>it! how he shrank! how he cringed! yet out he came to the



<P>Prince.&nbsp; Then Emmanuel commanded, and they took Diabolus and



<P>bound him fast in chains, the better to reserve him to the



<P>judgment that he had appointed for him.&nbsp; But Diabolus stood



<P>up to entreat for himself that Emmanuel would not send him



<P>into the deep, but suffer him to depart out of Mansoul in



<P>peace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Emmanuel had taken him and bound him in chains, he led



<P>him into the marketplace, and there, before Mansoul, stripped



<P>him of his armour in which he boasted so much before.&nbsp; This



<P>now was one of the acts of triumph of Emmanuel over his



<P>enemy; and all the while that the giant was stripping, the



<P>trumpets of the golden Prince did sound amain; the captains



<P>also shouted, and the soldiers did sing for joy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then was Mansoul called upon to behold the beginning of



<P>Emmanuel's triumph over him in whom they so much had trusted,



<P>and of whom they so much had boasted in the days when he



<P>flattered them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thus having made Diabolus naked in the eyes of Mansoul, and



<P>before the commanders of the Prince, in the next place, he



<P>commands that Diabolus should be bound with chains to his



<P>chariot wheels.&nbsp; Then leaving some of his forces, to wit,



<P>Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction, as a guard for the



<P>castle-gates, that resistance might be made on his behalf,



<P>(if any that heretofore followed Diabolus should make an



<P>attempt to possess it,) he did ride in triumph over him quite



<P>through the town of Mansoul, and so out at and before the



<P>gate called Eye-gate, to the plain where his camp did lie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But you cannot think, unless you had been there, as I was,



<P>what a shout there was in Emmanuel's camp when they saw the



<P>tyrant bound by the hand of their noble Prince, and tied to



<P>his chariot wheels!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And they said, 'He hath led captivity captive, he hath



<P>spoiled principalities and powers.&nbsp; Diabolus is subjected to



<P>the power of his sword, and made the object of all derision.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Those also that rode reformades, and that came down to see



<P>the battle, they shouted with that greatness of voice, and



<P>sung with such melodious notes, that they caused them that



<P>dwell in the highest orbs to open their windows, put out



<P>their heads, and look to see the cause of that glory.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The townsmen also, so many of them as saw this sight, were,



<P>as it were, while they looked, betwixt the earth and the



<P>heavens.&nbsp; True, they could not tell what would be the issue



<P>of things as to them; but all things were done in such



<P>excellent methods, and I cannot tell how, but things in the



<P>management of them seemed to cast a smile towards the town,



<P>so that their eyes, their heads, their hearts, and their



<P>minds, and all that they had, were taken and held while they



<P>observed Emmanuel's order.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So, when the brave Prince had finished this part of his



<P>triumph over Diabolus his foe, he turned him up in the midst



<P>of his contempt and shame, having given him a charge no more



<P>to be a possessor of Mansoul.&nbsp; Then went he from Emmanuel,



<P>and out of the midst of his camp, to inherit the parched



<P>places in a salt land, seeking rest, but finding none.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction were, both of



<P>them, men of very great majesty; their faces were like the



<P>faces of lions, and their words like the roaring of the sea;



<P>and they still quartered in Mr. Conscience's house, of whom



<P>mention was made before.&nbsp; When, therefore, the high and



<P>mighty Prince had thus far finished his triumph over



<P>Diabolus, the townsmen had more leisure to view and to behold



<P>the actions of these noble captains.&nbsp; But the captains



<P>carried it with that terror and dread in all that they did,



<P>(and you may be sure that they had private instructions so to



<P>do,) that they kept the town under continual heart-aching,



<P>and caused (in their apprehension) the well-being of Mansoul



<P>for the future to hang in doubt before them, so that for some



<P>considerable time they neither knew what rest, or ease, or



<P>peace, or hope meant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nor did the Prince himself as yet abide in the town of



<P>Mansoul, but in his royal pavilion in the camp, and in the



<P>midst of his Father's forces.&nbsp; So, at a time convenient, he



<P>sent special orders to Captain Boanerges to summons Mansoul,



<P>the whole of the townsmen, into the castle-yard, and then and



<P>there, before their faces, to take my Lord Understanding, Mr.



<P>Conscience, and that notable one, the Lord Willbewill, and



<P>put them all three in ward, and that they should set a strong



<P>guard upon them there, until his pleasure concerning them was



<P>further known: the which orders, when the captains had put



<P>them in execution, made no small addition to the fears of the



<P>town of Mansoul; for now, to their thinking, were their



<P>former fears of the ruin of Mansoul confirmed.&nbsp; Now, what



<P>death they should die, and how long they should be in dying,



<P>was that which most perplexed their heads and hearts; yea,



<P>they were afraid that Emmanuel would command them all into



<P>the deep, the place that the prince Diabolus was afraid of,



<P>for they knew that they had deserved it.&nbsp; Also to die by the



<P>sword in the face of the town, and in the open way of



<P>disgrace, from the hand of so good and so holy a prince,



<P>that, too, troubled them sore.&nbsp; The town was also greatly



<P>troubled for the men that were committed to ward, for that



<P>they were their stay and their guide, and for that they



<P>believed that, if those men were cut off, their execution



<P>would be but the beginning of the ruin of the town of



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; Wherefore, what do they, but, together with the men



<P>in prison, draw up a petition to the Prince, and sent it to



<P>Emmanuel by the hand of Mr. Would-live.&nbsp; So he went, and came



<P>to the Prince's quarters, and presented the petition, the sum



<P>of which was this:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Great and wonderful Potentate, victor over Diabolus, and



<P>conqueror of the town of Mansoul, We, the miserable



<P>inhabitants of that most woful corporation, do humbly beg



<P>that we may find favour in thy sight, and remember not



<P>against us former transgressions, nor yet the sins of the



<P>chief of our town: but spare us according to the greatness of



<P>thy mercy, and let us not die, but live in thy sight.&nbsp; So



<P>shall we be willing to be thy servants, and, if thou shalt



<P>think fit, to gather our meat under thy table.&nbsp; Amen.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So the petitioner went, as was said, with his petition to the



<P>Prince; and the Prince took it at his hand, but sent him away



<P>with silence.&nbsp; This still afflicted the town of Mansoul; but



<P>yet, considering that now they must either petition or die,



<P>for now they could not do anything else, therefore they



<P>consulted again, and sent another petition; and this petition



<P>was much after the form and method of the former.

<P>'1. My helmet, otherwise called an head-piece, is in hope of



<P>doing well at last, what lives soever you live.&nbsp; This is that



<P>which they had who said, that they should have peace, though



<P>they walked in the wickedness of their heart, to add



<P>drunkenness to thirst.&nbsp; A piece of approved armour this is,



<P>and whoever has it, and can hold it, so long no arrow, dart,



<P>sword, or shield can hurt him.&nbsp; This, therefore, keep on, and



<P>thou wilt keep off many a blow, my Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'2. My breastplate is a breastplate of iron.&nbsp; I had it forged



<P>in mine own country, and all my soldiers are armed therewith.



<P>In plain language, it is a hard heart, a heart as hard as



<P>iron, and as much past feeling as a stone; the which if you



<P>get and keep, neither mercy shall win you, nor judgment



<P>fright you.&nbsp; This therefore, is a piece of armour most



<P>necessary for all to put on that hate Shaddai, and that would



<P>fight against him under my banner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'3. My sword is a tongue that is set on fire of hell, and



<P>that can bend itself to speak evil of Shaddai, his Son, his



<P>ways, and people.&nbsp; Use this; it has been tried a thousand



<P>times twice told.&nbsp; Whoever hath it, keeps it, and makes that



<P>use of it as I would have him, can never be conquered by mine



<P>enemy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'4. My, shield is unbelief, or calling into question the



<P>truth of the word, or all the sayings that speak of the



<P>judgment that Shaddai has appointed for wicked men.&nbsp; Use this



<P>shield; many attempts he has made upon it, and sometimes, it



<P>is true, it has been bruised; but they that have writ of the



<P>wars of Emmanuel against my servants, have testified that he



<P>could do no mighty work there because of their unbelief.



<P>Now, to handle this weapon of mine aright, it is not to



<P>believe things because they are true, of what sort or by



<P>whomsoever asserted.&nbsp; If he speaks of judgment, care not for



<P>it; if he speaks of mercy, care not for it; if he promises,



<P>if he swears that he would do to Mansoul, if it turns, no



<P>hurt, but good, regard not what is said, question the truth



<P>of all, for it is to wield the shield of unbelief aright, and



<P>as my servants ought and do; and he that doth otherwise loves



<P>me not, nor do I count him but an enemy to me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'5. Another part or piece,' said Diabolus, 'of mine excellent



<P>armour is a dumb and prayerless spirit, a spirit that scorns



<P>to cry for mercy: wherefore be you, my Mansoul, sure that you



<P>make use of this.&nbsp; What! cry for quarter!&nbsp; Never do that,

if



<P>you would be mine.&nbsp; I know you are stout men, and am sure



<P>that I have clad you with that which is armour of proof.



<P>Wherefore, to cry to Shaddai for mercy, let that be far from



<P>you.&nbsp; Besides all this, I have a maul, firebrands, arrows,



<P>and death, all good hand-weapons, and such as will do



<P>execution.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After he had thus furnished his men with armour and arms, he



<P>addressed himself to them in such like words as these:



<P>'Remember,' quoth he, 'that I am your rightful king, and that



<P>you have taken an oath and entered into covenant to be true



<P>to me and my cause: I say, remember this, and show yourselves



<P>stout and valiant men of Mansoul.&nbsp; Remember also the kindness



<P>that I have always showed to you, and that without your



<P>petition I have granted to you external things; wherefore the



<P>privileges, grants, immunities, profits, and honours



<P>wherewith I have endowed you do call for, at your hands,



<P>returns of loyalty, my lion-like men of Mansoul: and when so



<P>fit a time to show it as when another shall seek to take my



<P>dominion over you into his own hands?&nbsp; One word more, and I



<P>have done.&nbsp; Can we but stand, and overcome this one shock or



<P>brunt, I doubt not but in little time all the world will be



<P>ours; and when that day comes, my true hearts, I will make



<P>you kings, princes, and captains, and what brave days shall



<P>we have then!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Diabolus having thus armed and forearmed his servants and



<P>vassals in Mansoul against their good and lawful King



<P>Shaddai, in the next place, he doubleth his guards at the



<P>gates of the town, and he takes himself to the castle, which



<P>was his stronghold.&nbsp; His vassals also, to show their wills,



<P>and supposed (but ignoble) gallantry, exercise themselves in



<P>their arms every day, and teach one another feats of war;



<P>they also defied their enemies, and sang up the praises of



<P>their tyrant; they threatened also what men they would be if



<P>ever things should rise so high as a war between Shaddai and



<P>their king.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now all this time the good King, the King Shaddai, was



<P>preparing to send an army to recover the town of Mansoul



<P>again from under the tyranny of their pretended king



<P>Diabolus; but he thought good, at first, not to send them by



<P>the hand and conduct of brave Emmanuel his Son, but under the



<P>hand of some of his servants, to see first by them the temper



<P>of Mansoul, and whether by them they would be won to the



<P>obedience of their King.&nbsp; The army consisted of above forty



<P>thousand, all true men, for they came from the King's own



<P>court, and were those of his own choosing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They came up to Mansoul under the conduct of four stout



<P>generals, each man being a captain of ten thousand men, and



<P>these are their names and their ensigns.&nbsp; The name of the



<P>first was Boanerges, the name of the second was Captain



<P>Conviction, the name of the third was Captain Judgment, and



<P>the name of the fourth was Captain Execution.&nbsp; These were the



<P>captains that Shaddai sent to regain Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These four captains, as was said, the King thought fit, in



<P>the first place, to send to Mansoul, to make an attempt upon



<P>it; for indeed generally in all his wars he did use to send



<P>these four captains in the van, for they were very stout and



<P>rough-hewn men, men that were fit to break the ice, and to



<P>make their way by dint of sword, and their men were like



<P>themselves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To each of these captains the King gave a banner, that it



<P>might be displayed, because of the goodness of his cause, and



<P>because of the right that he had to Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>First, to Captain Boanerges, for he was the chief, to him, I



<P>say, were given ten thousand men.&nbsp; His ensign was Mr.



<P>Thunder; he bare the black colours, and his scutcheon was the



<P>three burning thunderbolts.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The second captain was Captain Conviction; to him also were



<P>given ten thousand men.&nbsp; His ensign's name was Mr. Sorrow; he



<P>did bear the pale colours, and his scutcheon was the book of



<P>the law wide open, from whence issued a flame of fire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The third captain was Captain Judgment; to him were given ten



<P>thousand men.&nbsp; His ensign's name was Mr. Terror; he bare the



<P>red colours, and his scutcheon was a burning fiery furnace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The fourth captain was Captain Execution; to him were given



<P>ten thousand men.&nbsp; His ensign was one Mr. Justice; he also



<P>bare the red colours, and his scutcheon was a fruitless tree,



<P>with an axe lying at the root thereof.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These four captains, as I said, had every one of them under



<P>his command ten thousand men, all of good fidelity to the



<P>King, and stout at their military actions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, the captains and their forces, their men and under



<P>officers, being had upon a day by Shaddai into the field, and



<P>there called all over by their names, were then and there put



<P>into such harness as became their degree and that service



<P>which now they were going about for their King.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when the King had mustered his forces, (for it is he



<P>that mustereth the host to the battle,) he gave unto the



<P>captains their several commissions, with charge and



<P>commandment in the audience of all the soldiers, that they



<P>should take heed faithfully and courageously to do and



<P>execute the same.&nbsp; Their commissions were, for the substance



<P>of them, the same in form, though, as to name, title, place



<P>and degree of the captains, there might be some, but very



<P>small variation.&nbsp; And here let me give you an account of the



<P>matter and sum contained in their commission.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A COMMISSION FROM THE GREAT SHADDAI, KING OF MANSOUL, TO HIS



<P>TRUSTY AND NOBLE CAPTAIN, THE CAPTAIN BOANERGES, FOR HIS



<P>MAKING WAR UPON THE TOWN OF MANSOUL.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'O, thou Boanerges, one of my stout and thundering captains



<P>over one ten thousand of my valiant and faithful servants, go



<P>thou in my name, with this thy force, to the miserable town



<P>of Mansoul; and when thou comest thither, offer them first



<P>conditions of peace; and command them that, casting off the



<P>yoke and tyranny of the wicked Diabolus, they return to me,



<P>their rightful Prince and Lord.&nbsp; Command them also that they



<P>cleanse themselves from all that is his in the town of



<P>Mansoul, and look to thyself, that thou hast good



<P>satisfaction touching the truth of their obedience.&nbsp; Thus



<P>when thou hast commanded them, (if they in truth submit



<P>thereto,) then do thou, to the uttermost of thy power, what



<P>in thee lies to set up for me a garrison in the famous town



<P>of Mansoul; nor do thou hurt the least native that moveth or



<P>breatheth therein, if they will submit themselves to me, but



<P>treat thou such as if they were thy friend or brother; for



<P>all such I love, and they shall be dear unto me, and tell



<P>them that I will take a time to come unto them, and to let



<P>them know that I am merciful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But if they shall, notwithstanding thy summons and the



<P>producing of thy authority, resist, stand out against thee,



<P>and rebel, then do I command thee to make use of all thy



<P>cunning, power, might, and force, to bring them under by



<P>strength of hand.&nbsp; Farewell.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thus you see the sum of their commissions; for, as I said



<P>before, for the substance of them, they were the same that



<P>the rest of the noble captains had.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wherefore they, having received each commander his authority



<P>at the hand of their King, the day being appointed, and the



<P>place of their rendezvous prefixed, each commander appeared



<P>in such gallantry as became his cause and calling.&nbsp; So, after



<P>a new entertainment from Shaddai, with flying colours they



<P>set forward to march towards the famous town of Mansoul.



<P>Captain Boanerges led the van, Captain Conviction and Captain



<P>Judgment made up the main body, and Captain Execution brought



<P>up the rear.&nbsp; They then, having a great way to go, (for the



<P>town of Mansoul was far off from the court of Shaddai,)



<P>marched through the regions and countries of many people, not



<P>hurting or abusing any, but blessing wherever they came.



<P>They also lived upon the King's cost in all the way they



<P>went.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Having travelled thus for many days, at last they came within



<P>sight of Mansoul; the which when they saw, the captains could



<P>for their hearts do no less than for a while bewail the



<P>condition of the town; for they quickly saw how that it was



<P>prostrate to the will of Diabolus, and to his ways and



<P>designs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, to be short, the captains came up before the town,



<P>march up to Ear-gate, sit down there (for that was the place



<P>of hearing).&nbsp; So, when they had pitched their tents and



<P>entrenched themselves, they addressed themselves to make



<P>their assault.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now the townsfolk at first, beholding so gallant a company,



<P>so bravely accoutred, and so excellently disciplined, having



<P>on their glittering armour, and displaying of their flying



<P>colours, could not but come out of their houses and gaze.



<P>But the cunning fox Diabolus, fearing that the people, after



<P>this sight, should, on a sudden summons, open the gates to



<P>the captains, came down with all haste from the castle, and



<P>made them retire into the body of the town, who, when he had



<P>them there, made this lying and deceivable speech unto them:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Gentlemen,' quoth he, 'although you are my trusty and well-



<P>beloved friends, yet I cannot but a little chide you for your



<P>late uncircumspect action, in going out to gaze on that great



<P>and mighty force that but yesterday sat down before, and have



<P>now entrenched themselves in order to the maintaining of a



<P>siege against the famous town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Do you know who



<P>they are, whence they come, and what is their purpose in



<P>sitting down before the town of Mansoul?&nbsp; They are they of



<P>whom I have told you long ago, that they would come to



<P>destroy this town, and against whom I have been at the cost



<P>to arm you with CAP-A-PIE for your body, besides great



<P>fortifications for your mind.&nbsp; Wherefore, then, did you not



<P>rather, even at the first appearance of them, cry out, "Fire



<P>the beacons!" and give the whole town an alarm concerning



<P>them, that we might all have been in a posture of defence,



<P>and been ready to have received them with the highest acts of



<P>defiance?&nbsp; Then had you showed yourselves men to my liking;



<P>whereas, by what you have done, you have made me half afraid



<P>- I say, half afraid - that when they and we shall come to



<P>push a pike, I shall find you want courage to stand it out



<P>any longer.&nbsp; Wherefore have I commanded a watch, and that you



<P>should double your guards at the gates?&nbsp; Wherefore have I



<P>endeavoured to make you as hard as iron, and your hearts as a



<P>piece of the nether millstone?&nbsp; Was it, think you, that you



<P>might show yourselves women, and that you might go out like a



<P>company of innocents to gaze on your mortal foes?&nbsp; Fie, fie!



<P>put yourselves into a posture of defence, beat up the drum,



<P>gather together in warlike manner, that our foes may know



<P>that, before they shall conquer this corporation, there are



<P>valiant men in the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I will leave off now to chide, and will not further rebuke



<P>you; but I charge you, that henceforwards you let me see no



<P>more such actions.&nbsp; Let not henceforward a man of you,



<P>without order first obtained from me, so much as show his



<P>head over the wall of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; You have now



<P>heard me; do as I have commanded, and you shall cause me that



<P>I dwell securely with you, and that I take care, as for



<P>myself, so for your safety and honour also.&nbsp; Farewell."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now were the townsmen strangely altered; they were as men



<P>stricken with a panic fear; they ran to and fro through the



<P>streets of the town of Mansoul, crying out, 'Help, help! the



<P>men that turn the world upside down are come hither also.'



<P>Nor could any of them be quiet after; but still, as men



<P>bereft of wit, they cried out, 'The destroyers of our peace



<P>and people are come.'&nbsp; This went down with Diabolus.&nbsp; 'Ah,'



<P>quoth he to himself, 'this I like well: now it is as I would



<P>have it; now you show your obedience to your prince.&nbsp; Hold



<P>you but here, and then let them take the town if they can.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, before the King's forces had sat before Mansoul three



<P>days, Captain Boanerges commanded his trumpeter to go down to



<P>Ear-gate, and there, in the name of the great Shaddai, to



<P>summon Mansoul to give audience to the message that he, in



<P>his Master's name, was to them commanded to deliver.&nbsp; So the



<P>trumpeter, whose name was Take-heed-what-you-hear, went up,



<P>as he was commanded, to Ear-gate, and there sounded his



<P>trumpet for a hearing; but there was none that appeared that



<P>gave answer or regard, for so had Diabolus commanded.&nbsp; So the



<P>trumpeter returned to his captain, and told him what he had



<P>done, and also how he had sped; whereat the captain was



<P>grieved, but bid the trumpeter go to his tent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Again Captain Boanerges sendeth his trumpeter to Ear-gate, to



<P>sound as before for a hearing; but they again kept close,



<P>came not out, nor would they give him an answer, so observant



<P>were they of the command of Diabolus their king.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then the captains and other field officers called a council



<P>of war, to consider what further was to be done for the



<P>gaining of the town of Mansoul; and, after some close and



<P>thorough debate upon the contents of their commissions, they



<P>concluded yet to give to the town, by the hand of the fore-



<P>named trumpeter, another summons to hear; but if that shall



<P>be refused, said they, and that the town shall stand it out



<P>still, then they determined, and bid the trumpeter tell them



<P>so, that they would endeavour, by what means they could, to



<P>compel them by force to the obedience of their King.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So Captain Boanerges commanded his trumpeter to go up to Ear-



<P>gate again, and, in the name of the great King Shaddai, to



<P>give it a very loud summons to come down without delay to



<P>Ear-gate, there to give audience to the King's most noble



<P>captains.&nbsp; So the trumpeter went, and did as he was



<P>commanded: he went up to Ear-gate, and sounded his trumpet,



<P>and gave a third summons to Mansoul.&nbsp; He said, moreover, that



<P>if this they should still refuse to do, the captains of his



<P>prince would with might come down upon them, and endeavour to



<P>reduce them to their obedience by force.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then stood up my Lord Willbewill, who was the governor of the



<P>town, (this Willbewill was that apostate of whom mention was



<P>made before,) and the keeper of the gates of Mansoul.&nbsp; He



<P>therefore, with big and ruffling words, demanded of the



<P>trumpeter who he was, whence he came, and what was the cause



<P>of his making so hideous a noise at the gate, and speaking



<P>such insufferable words against the town of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The trumpeter answered, 'I am servant to the most noble



<P>captain, Captain Boanerges, general of the forces of the



<P>great King Shaddai, against whom both thyself, with the whole



<P>town of Mansoul, have rebelled, and lift up the heel; and my



<P>master, the captain, hath a special message to this town, and



<P>to thee, as a member thereof; the which if you of Mansoul



<P>shall peaceably hear, so; and if not, you must take what



<P>follows.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Lord Willbewill, 'I will carry thy words to my



<P>lord, and will know what he will say.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the trumpeter soon replied, saying.&nbsp; 'Our message is not



<P>to the giant Diabolus, but to the miserable town of Mansoul;



<P>nor shall we at all regard what answer by him is made, nor



<P>yet by any for him.&nbsp; We are sent to this town to recover it



<P>from under his cruel tyranny, and to persuade it to submit,



<P>as in former times it did, to the most excellent King



<P>Shaddai.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Lord Willbewill, 'I will do your errand to the



<P>town.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The trumpeter then replied, 'Sir, do not deceive us, lest, in



<P>so doing, you deceive yourselves much more.'&nbsp; He added,



<P>moreover, 'For we are resolved, if in peaceable manner you do



<P>not submit yourselves, then to make a war upon you, and to



<P>bring you under by force.&nbsp; And of the truth of what I now



<P>say, this shall be a sign unto you, - you shall see the black



<P>flag, with its hot, burning thunder-bolts, set upon the mount



<P>to-morrow, as a token of defiance against your prince, and of



<P>our resolutions to reduce you to your Lord and rightful



<P>King.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So the said Lord Willbewill returned from off the wall, and



<P>the trumpeter came into the camp.&nbsp; When the trumpeter was



<P>come into the camp, the captains and officers of the mighty



<P>King Shaddai came together to know if he had obtained a



<P>hearing, and what was the effect of his errand.&nbsp; So the



<P>trumpeter told, saying, 'When I had sounded my trumpet, and



<P>had called aloud to the town for a hearing, my Lord



<P>Willbewill, the governor of the town, and he that hath charge



<P>of the gates, came up when he heard me sound, and, looking



<P>over the wall, he asked me what I was, whence I came, and



<P>what was the cause of my making this noise.&nbsp; So I told him my



<P>errand, and by whose authority I brought it.&nbsp; "Then," said



<P>he, "I will tell it to the governor and to Mansoul;" and then



<P>I returned to my lords.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the brave Boanerges, 'Let us yet for a while lie



<P>still in our trenches, and see what these rebels will do.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now when the time drew nigh that audience by Mansoul must be



<P>given to the brave Boanerges and his companions, it was



<P>commanded that all the men of war throughout the whole camp



<P>of Shaddai should as one man stand to their arms, and make



<P>themselves ready, if the town of Mansoul shall hear, to



<P>receive it forthwith to mercy; but if not, to force a



<P>subjection.&nbsp; So the day being come, the trumpeters sounded,



<P>and that throughout the whole camp, that the men of war might



<P>be in a readiness for that which then should be the work of



<P>the day.&nbsp; But when they that were in the town of Mansoul



<P>heard the sound of the trumpets throughout the camp of



<P>Shaddai, and thinking no other but that it must be in order



<P>to storm the corporation, they at first were put to great



<P>consternation of spirit; but after they a little were settled



<P>again, they also made what preparation they could for a war,



<P>if they did storm; else, to secure themselves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, when the utmost time was come, Boanerges was resolved



<P>to hear their answer; wherefore he sent out his trumpeter



<P>again to summon Mansoul to a hearing of the message that they



<P>had brought from Shaddai.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So he went and sounded, and the townsmen came up, but made



<P>Ear-gate as sure as they could.&nbsp; Now when they were come up



<P>to the top of the wall, Captain Boanerges desired to see the



<P>Lord Mayor; but my Lord Incredulity was then Lord Mayor, for



<P>he came in the room of my Lord Lustings.&nbsp; So Incredulity came



<P>up and showed himself over the wall; but when the Captain



<P>Boanerges had set his eyes upon him, he cried out aloud,



<P>'This is not he: where is my Lord Understanding, the ancient



<P>Lord Mayor of the town of Mansoul? for to him I would deliver



<P>my message.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the giant (for Diabolus was also come down) to the



<P>captain, 'Mr.&nbsp; Captain, you have by your boldness given to



<P>Mansoul at least four summonses to subject herself to your



<P>King, by whose authority I know not, nor will I dispute that



<P>now.&nbsp; I ask, therefore, what is the reason of all this ado,



<P>or what would you be at if you knew yourselves?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then Captain Boanerges, whose were the black colours, and



<P>whose scutcheon was the three burning thunderbolts, taking no



<P>notice of the giant or of his speech, thus addressed himself



<P>to the town of Mansoul: 'Be it known unto you, O unhappy and



<P>rebellious Mansoul, that the most gracious King, the great



<P>King Shaddai, my Master, hath sent me unto you with



<P>commission' (and so he showed to the town his broad seal) 'to



<P>reduce you to his obedience; and he hath commanded me, in



<P>case you yield upon my summons, to carry it to you as if you



<P>were my friends or brethren; but he also hath bid, that if,



<P>after summons to submit you still stand out and rebel, we



<P>should endeavour to take you by force.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then stood forth Captain Conviction, and said, (his were the



<P>pale colours, and for a scutcheon he had the book of the law



<P>wide open, etc.,) 'Hear, O Mansoul!&nbsp; Thou, O Mansoul, wast



<P>once famous for innocency, but now thou art degenerated into



<P>lies and deceit.&nbsp; Thou hast heard what my brother, the



<P>Captain Boanerges, hath said; and it is your wisdom, and will



<P>be your happiness, to stoop to, and accept of conditions of



<P>peace and mercy when offered, specially when offered by one



<P>against whom thou hast rebelled, and one who is of power to



<P>tear thee in pieces, for so is Shaddai, our King; nor, when



<P>he is angry, can anything stand before him.&nbsp; If you say you



<P>have not sinned, or acted rebellion against our King, the



<P>whole of your doings since the day that you cast off his



<P>service (and there was the beginning of your sin) will



<P>sufficiently testify against you.&nbsp; What else means your



<P>hearkening to the tyrant, and your receiving him for your



<P>king?&nbsp; What means else your rejecting of the laws of Shaddai,



<P>and your obeying of Diabolus?&nbsp; Yea, what means this your



<P>taking up of arms against, and the shutting of your gates



<P>upon us, the faithful servants of your King?&nbsp; Be ruled then,



<P>and accept of my brother's invitation, and overstand not the



<P>time of mercy, but agree with thine adversary quickly.&nbsp; Ah,



<P>Mansoul! suffer not thyself to be kept from mercy, and to be



<P>run into a thousand miseries, by the flattering wiles of



<P>Diabolus.&nbsp; Perhaps that piece of deceit may attempt to make



<P>you believe that we seek our own profit in this our service,



<P>but know it is obedience to our King, and love to your



<P>happiness, that is the cause of this undertaking of ours.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Again I say to thee, O Mansoul, consider if it be not



<P>amazing grace that Shaddai should so humble himself as he



<P>doth: now he, by us, reasons with you, in a way of entreaty



<P>and sweet persuasions, that you would subject yourselves to



<P>him.&nbsp; Has he that need of you that we are sure you have of



<P>him?&nbsp; No, no; but he is merciful, and will not that Mansoul



<P>should die, but turn to him and live.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then stood forth Captain Judgment, whose were the red



<P>colours, and for a scutcheon he had the burning fiery



<P>furnace, and he said, 'O ye, the inhabitants of the town of



<P>Mansoul, that have lived so long in rebellion and acts of



<P>treason against the King Shaddai, know that we come not to-



<P>day to this place, in this manner, with our message of our



<P>own minds, or to revenge our own quarrel; it is the King, my



<P>Master, that hath sent us to reduce you to your obedience to



<P>him; the which if you refuse in a peaceable way to yield, we



<P>have commission to compel you thereto.&nbsp; And never think of



<P>yourselves, nor yet suffer the tyrant Diabolus to persuade



<P>you to think, that our King, by his power, is not able to



<P>bring you down, and to lay you under his feet; for he is the



<P>former of all things, and if he touches the mountains, they



<P>smoke.&nbsp; Nor will the gate of the King's clemency stand always



<P>open; for the day that shall burn like an oven is before him;



<P>yea, it hasteth greatly, it slumbereth not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'O Mansoul, is it little in thine eyes that our King doth



<P>offer thee mercy, and that after so many provocations?&nbsp; Yea,



<P>he still holdeth out his golden sceptre to thee, and will not



<P>yet suffer his gate to be shut against thee: wilt thou



<P>provoke him to do it?&nbsp; If so, consider of what I say; to thee



<P>it is opened no more for ever.&nbsp; If thou sayest thou shalt not



<P>see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in



<P>him.&nbsp; Yea, because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee



<P>away with his stroke; then a great ransom cannot deliver



<P>thee.&nbsp; Will he esteem thy riches?&nbsp; No, not gold, nor all the



<P>forces of strength.&nbsp; He hath prepared his throne for



<P>judgment, for he will come with fire, and with his chariots



<P>like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his



<P>rebukes with flames of fire.&nbsp; Therefore, O Mansoul, take heed



<P>lest, after thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked,



<P>justice and judgment should take hold of thee.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now while the Captain Judgment was making this oration to the



<P>town of Mansoul, it was observed by some that Diabolus



<P>trembled; but he proceeded in his parable and said, 'O thou



<P>woful town of Mansoul, wilt thou not yet set open thy gate to



<P>receive us, the deputies of thy King, and those that would



<P>rejoice to see thee live?&nbsp; Can thine heart endure, or can thy



<P>hands be strong, in the day that he shall deal in judgment



<P>with thee?&nbsp; I say, canst thou endure to be forced to drink,



<P>as one would drink sweet wine, the sea of wrath that our King



<P>has prepared for Diabolus and his angels?&nbsp; Consider, betimes



<P>consider.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then stood forth the fourth captain, the noble Captain



<P>Execution, and said, 'O town of Mansoul, once famous, but now



<P>like the fruitless bough, once the delight of the high ones,



<P>but now a den for Diabolus, hearken also to me, and to the



<P>words that I shall speak to thee in the name of the great



<P>Shaddai.&nbsp; Behold, the axe is laid to the root of the trees:



<P>every tree, therefore, that bringeth not forth good fruit, is



<P>hewn down and cast into the fire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Thou, O town of Mansoul, hast hitherto been this fruitless



<P>tree; thou bearest nought but thorns and briars.&nbsp; Thy evil



<P>fruit bespeaks thee not to be a good tree; thy grapes are



<P>grapes of gall, thy clusters are bitter.&nbsp; Thou hast rebelled



<P>against thy King; and, lo! we, the power and force of



<P>Shaddai, are the axe that is laid to thy root.&nbsp; What sayest



<P>thou?&nbsp; Wilt thou turn?&nbsp; I say again, tell me, before the



<P>first blow is given, wilt thou turn?&nbsp; Our axe must first be



<P>laid TO thy root before it be laid AT thy root; it must first



<P>be laid TO thy root in a way of threatening, before it is



<P>laid AT thy root by way of execution; and between these two



<P>is required thy repentance, and this is all the time that



<P>thou hast.&nbsp; What wilt thou do?&nbsp; Wilt thou turn, or shall I



<P>smite?&nbsp; If I fetch my blow, Mansoul, down you go; for I have



<P>commission to lay my axe AT as well as TO thy roots, nor will



<P>anything but yielding to our King prevent doing of execution.



<P>What art thou fit for, O Mansoul, if mercy preventeth not,



<P>but to be hewn down, and cast into the fire and burned?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'O Mansoul, patience and forbearance do not act for ever: a



<P>year, or two, or three, they may; but if thou provoke by a



<P>three years' rebellion, (and thou hast already done more than



<P>this,) then what follows but, 'Cut it down'? nay, 'After that



<P>thou shalt cut it down.'&nbsp; And dost thou think that these are



<P>but threatenings, or that our King has not power to execute



<P>his words?&nbsp; O Mansoul, thou wilt find that in the words of



<P>our King, when they are by sinners made little or light of,



<P>there is not only threatening, but burning coals of fire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Thou hast been a cumber-ground long already, and wilt thou



<P>continue so still?&nbsp; Thy sin has brought this army to thy



<P>walls, and shall it bring it in judgment to do execution into



<P>thy town?&nbsp; Thou hast heard what the captains have said, but



<P>as yet thou shuttest thy gates.&nbsp; Speak out, Mansoul; wilt



<P>thou do so still, or wilt thou accept of conditions of



<P>peace?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These brave speeches of these four noble captains the town of



<P>Mansoul refused to hear; yet a sound thereof did beat against



<P>Ear-gate, though the force thereof could not break it open.



<P>In fine, the town desired a time to prepare their answer to



<P>these demands.&nbsp; The captains then told them, that if they



<P>would throw out to them one Ill-Pause that was in the town,



<P>that they might reward him according to his works, then they



<P>would give them time to consider; but if they would not cast



<P>him to them over the wall of Mansoul, then they would give



<P>them none; 'for,' said they, 'we know that, so long as Ill-



<P>Pause draws breath in Mansoul, all good consideration will be



<P>confounded, and nothing but mischief will come thereon.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then Diabolus, who was there present, being loath to lose his



<P>Ill-Pause, because he was his orator, (and yet be sure he



<P>had, could the captains have laid their fingers on him,) was



<P>resolved at this instant to give them answer by himself; but



<P>then changing his mind, he commanded the then Lord Mayor, the



<P>Lord Incredulity, to do it, saying, 'My lord, do you give



<P>these runagates an answer, and speak out, that Mansoul may



<P>hear and understand you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So Incredulity, at Diabolus' command, began, and said,



<P>'Gentlemen, you have here, as we do behold, to the



<P>disturbance of our prince and the molestation of the town of



<P>Mansoul, camped against it: but from whence you come, we will



<P>not know; and what you are, we will not believe.&nbsp; Indeed, you



<P>tell us in your terrible speech that you have this authority



<P>from Shaddai, but by what right he commands you to do it, of



<P>that we shall yet be ignorant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You have also, by the authority aforesaid, summoned this



<P>town to desert her lord, and, for protection, to yield up



<P>herself to the great Shaddai, your King; flatteringly telling



<P>her, that if she will do it, he will pass by and not charge



<P>her with her past offences.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Further, you have also, to the terror of the town of



<P>Mansoul, threatened with great and sore destructions to



<P>punish this corporation, if she consents not to do as your



<P>wills would have her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Now, captains, from whencesoever you come, and though your



<P>designs be ever so right, yet know ye that neither my Lord



<P>Diabolus, nor I, his servant, Incredulity, nor yet our brave



<P>Mansoul, doth regard either your persons, message, or the



<P>King that you say hath sent you.&nbsp; His power, his greatness,



<P>his vengeance, we fear not; nor will we yield at all to your



<P>summons.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'As for the war that you threaten to make upon us, we must



<P>therein defend ourselves as well as we can; and know ye, that



<P>we are not without wherewithal to bid defiance to you; and,



<P>in short, (for I will not be tedious,) I tell you, that we



<P>take you to be some vagabond runagate crew, that having



<P>shaken off all obedience to your King, have gotten together



<P>in tumultuous manner, and are ranging from place to place to



<P>see if, through the flatteries you are skilled to make on the



<P>one side, and threats wherewith you think to fright on the



<P>other, to make some silly town, city, or country, desert



<P>their place, and leave it to you; but Mansoul is none of



<P>them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'To conclude: we dread you not, we fear you not, nor will we



<P>obey your summons.&nbsp; Our gates we will shut upon you, our



<P>place we will keep you out of.&nbsp; Nor will we long thus suffer



<P>you to sit down before us: our people must live in quiet:



<P>your appearance doth disturb them.&nbsp; Wherefore arise with bag



<P>and baggage, and begone, or we will let fly from the walls



<P>against you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This oration, made by old Incredulity, was seconded by



<P>desperate Willbewill, in words to this effect: 'Gentlemen, we



<P>have heard your demands, and the noise of your threats, and



<P>have heard the sound of your summons; but we fear not your



<P>force, we regard not your threats, but will still abide as



<P>you found us.&nbsp; And we command you, that in three days' time



<P>you cease to appear in these parts, or you shall know what it



<P>is once to dare offer to rouse the lion Diabolus when asleep



<P>in his town of Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Recorder, whose name was Forget-Good, he also added as



<P>followeth: 'Gentlemen, my lords, as you see, have with mild



<P>and gentle words answered your rough and angry speeches: they



<P>have, moreover, in my hearing, given you leave quietly to



<P>depart as you came; wherefore, take their kindness and be



<P>gone.&nbsp; We might have come out with force upon you, and have



<P>caused you to feel the dint of our swords; but as we love



<P>ease and quiet ourselves, so we love not to hurt or molest



<P>others.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then did the town of Mansoul shout for joy, as if by Diabolus



<P>and his crew some great advantage had been gotten of the



<P>captains.&nbsp; They also rang the bells, and made merry, and



<P>danced upon the walls.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Diabolus also returned to the castle, and the Lord Mayor and



<P>Recorder to their place; but the Lord Willbewill took special



<P>care that the gates should be secured with double guards,



<P>double bolts, and double locks and bars; and that Ear-gate



<P>especially might the better be looked to, for that was the



<P>gate in at which the King's forces sought most to enter.&nbsp; The



<P>Lord Willbewill made one old Mr. Prejudice, an angry and ill-



<P>conditioned fellow, captain of the ward at that gate, and put



<P>under his power sixty men, called deaf men; men advantageous



<P>for that service, forasmuch as they mattered no words of the



<P>captains, nor of the soldiers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now when the captains saw the answer of the great ones, and



<P>that they could not get a hearing from the old natives of the



<P>town, and that Mansoul was resolved to give the King's army



<P>battle, they prepared themselves to receive them, and to try



<P>it out by the power of the arm.&nbsp; And, first, they made their



<P>force more formidable against Ear-gate; for they knew that,



<P>unless they could penetrate that, no good could be done upon



<P>the town.&nbsp; This done, they put the rest of their men in their



<P>places; after which, they gave out the word, which was, 'YE



<P>MUST BE BORN AGAIN.'&nbsp; Then they sounded the trumpet; then



<P>they in the town made them answer, with shout against shout,



<P>charge against charge, and so the battle began.&nbsp; Now they in



<P>the town had planted upon the tower over Ear-gate two great



<P>guns, the one called High-mind, and the other Heady.&nbsp; Unto



<P>these two guns they trusted much; they were cast in the



<P>castle by Diabolus' founder, whose name was Mr. Puff-up, and



<P>mischievous pieces they were.&nbsp; But so vigilant and watchful,



<P>when the captains saw them, were they, that though sometimes



<P>their shot would go by their ears with a whiz, yet they did



<P>them no harm.&nbsp; By these two guns the townsfolk made no



<P>question but greatly to annoy the camp of Shaddai, and well



<P>enough to secure the gate; but they had not much cause to



<P>boast of what execution they did, as by what follows will be



<P>gathered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The famous Mansoul had also some other small pieces in it, of



<P>the which they made use against the camp of Shaddai.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They from the camp also did as stoutly, and with as much of



<P>that as may in truth be called valour, let fly as fast at the



<P>town and at Ear-gate; for they saw that, unless they could



<P>break open Ear-gate, it would be but in vain to batter the



<P>wall.&nbsp; Now the King's captains had brought with them several



<P>slings, and two or three battering-rams; with their slings,



<P>therefore, they battered the houses and people of the town,



<P>and with their rams they sought to break Ear-gate open.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The camp and the town had several skirmishes and brisk



<P>encounters, while the captains with their engines made many



<P>brave attempts to break open or beat down the tower that was



<P>over Ear-gate, and at the said gate to make their entrance;



<P>but Mansoul stood it out so lustily, through the rage of



<P>Diabolus, the valour of the Lord Willbewill, and the conduct



<P>of old Incredulity, the Mayor, and Mr. Forget-Good, the



<P>Recorder, that the charge and expense of that summer's wars,



<P>on the King's side, seemed to be almost quite lost, and the



<P>advantage to return to Mansoul.&nbsp; But when the captains saw



<P>how it was they made a fair retreat, and entrenched



<P>themselves in their winter quarters.&nbsp; Now, in this war, you



<P>must needs think there was much loss on both sides, of which



<P>be pleased to accept of this brief account following.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The King's captains, when they marched from the court to come



<P>up against Mansoul to war, as they came crossing over the



<P>country, they happened to light upon three young fellows that



<P>had a mind to go for soldiers: proper men they were, and men



<P>of courage and skill, to appearance.&nbsp; Their names were Mr.



<P>Tradition, Mr. Human-Wisdom, and Mr. Man's-Invention.&nbsp; So



<P>they came up to the captains, and proffered their service to



<P>Shaddai.&nbsp; The captains then told them of their design, and



<P>bid them not to be rash in their offers; but the young men



<P>told them they had considered the thing before, and that



<P>hearing they were upon their march for such a design, came



<P>hither on purpose to meet them, that they might be listed



<P>under their excellencies.&nbsp; Then Captain Boanerges, for that



<P>they were men of courage, listed them into his company, and



<P>so away they went to the war.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when the war was begun, in one of the briskest



<P>skirmishes, so it was, that a company of the Lord



<P>Willbewill's men sallied out at the sallyport or postern of



<P>the town, and fell in upon the rear of Captain Boanerges'



<P>men, where these three fellows happened to be; so they took



<P>them prisoners, and away they carried them into the town,



<P>where they had not lain long in durance, but it began to be



<P>noised about the streets of the town what three notable



<P>prisoners the Lord Willbewill's men had taken, and brought in



<P>prisoners out of the camp of Shaddai.&nbsp; At length tidings



<P>thereof were carried to Diabolus to the castle, to wit what



<P>my Lord Willbewill's men had done, and whom they had taken



<P>prisoners.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then Diabolus called for Willbewill, to know the certainty of



<P>this matter.&nbsp; So he asked him, and he told him.&nbsp; Then did

the



<P>giant send for the prisoners, and, when they were come,



<P>demanded of them who they were, whence they came, and what



<P>they did in the camp of Shaddai; and they told him.&nbsp; Then he



<P>sent them to ward again.&nbsp; Not many days after, he sent for



<P>them to him again, and then asked them if they would be



<P>willing to serve him against their former captains.&nbsp; They



<P>then told him that they did not so much live by religion as



<P>by the fates of fortune; and that since his lordship was



<P>willing to entertain them, they should be willing to serve



<P>him.&nbsp; Now while things were thus in hand, there was one



<P>Captain Anything, a great doer, in the town of Mansoul; and



<P>to this Captain Anything did Diabolus send these men, and a



<P>note under his hand, to receive them into his company, the



<P>contents of which letter were thus:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Anything, my darling, - The three men that are the bearers



<P>of this letter have a desire to serve me in the war; nor know



<P>I better to whose conduct to commit them than to thine.



<P>Receive them, therefore, in my name, and, as need shall



<P>require, make use of them against Shaddai and his men.



<P>Farewell.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So they came, and he received them; and he made of two of



<P>them sergeants; but he made Mr. Man's-Invention his ancient-



<P>bearer.&nbsp; But thus much for this, and now to return to the



<P>camp.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They of the camp did also some execution upon the town; for



<P>they did beat down the roof of the Lord Mayor's house, and so



<P>laid him more open than he was before.&nbsp; They had almost, with



<P>a sling, slain my Lord Willbewill outright; but he made a



<P>shift to recover again.&nbsp; But they made a notable slaughter



<P>among the aldermen, for with one only shot they cut off six



<P>of them; to wit, Mr. Swearing, Mr. Whoring, Mr. Fury, Mr.



<P>Stand-to-Lies, Mr. Drunkenness, and Mr. Cheating.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They also dismounted the two guns that stood upon the tower



<P>over Ear-gate, and laid them flat in the dirt.&nbsp; I told you



<P>before that the King's noble captains had drawn off to their



<P>winter quarters, and had there entrenched themselves and



<P>their carriages, so as with the best advantage to their King,



<P>and the greatest annoyance to the enemy, they might give



<P>seasonable and warm alarms to the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; And this



<P>design of them did so hit, that I may say they did almost



<P>what they would to the molestation of the corporation.&nbsp; For



<P>now could not Mansoul sleep securely as before, nor could



<P>they now go to their debaucheries with that quietness as in



<P>times past; for they had from the camp of Shaddai such



<P>frequent, warm, and terrifying alarms, yea, alarms upon



<P>alarms, first at one gate and then at another, and again at



<P>all the gates at once, that they were broken as to former



<P>peace.&nbsp; Yea, they had their alarms so frequently, and that



<P>when the nights were at longest, the weather coldest, and so



<P>consequently the season most unseasonable, that that winter



<P>was to the town of Mansoul a winter by itself.&nbsp; Sometimes the



<P>trumpets would sound, and sometimes the slings would whirl



<P>the stones into the town.&nbsp; Sometimes ten thousand of the



<P>King's soldiers would be running round the walls of Mansoul



<P>at midnight, shouting and lifting up the voice for the



<P>battle.&nbsp; Sometimes, again, some of them in the town would be



<P>wounded, and their cry and lamentable voice would be heard,



<P>to the great molestation of the now languishing town of



<P>Mansoul.&nbsp; Yea, so distressed with those that laid siege



<P>against them were they, that, I dare say, Diabolus, their



<P>king, had in these days his rest much broken.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In these days, as I was informed, new thoughts, and thoughts



<P>that began to run counter one to another, began to possess



<P>the minds of the men of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Some would say,



<P>'There is no living thus.'&nbsp; Others would then reply, 'This



<P>will be over shortly.'&nbsp; Then would a third stand up and



<P>answer, 'Let us turn to the King Shaddai, and so put an end



<P>to these troubles.'&nbsp; And a fourth would come in with a fear,



<P>saying, 'I doubt he will not receive us.'&nbsp; The old gentleman,



<P>too, the Recorder, that was so before Diabolus took Mansoul,



<P>he also began to talk aloud, and his words were now to the



<P>town of Mansoul as if they were great claps of thunder.&nbsp; No



<P>noise now so terrible to Mansoul as was his, with the noise



<P>of the soldiers and shoutings of the captains.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Also things began to grow scarce in Mansoul; now the things



<P>that her soul lusted after were departing from her.&nbsp; Upon all



<P>her pleasant things there was a blast, and burning instead of



<P>beauty.&nbsp; Wrinkles now, and some shows of the shadow of death,



<P>were upon the inhabitants of Mansoul.&nbsp; And now, O how glad



<P>would Mansoul have been to have enjoyed quietness and



<P>satisfaction of mind, though joined with the meanest



<P>condition in the world!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The captains also, in the deep of this winter, did send by



<P>the mouth of Boanerges' trumpeter a summons to Mansoul to



<P>yield up herself to the King, the great King Shaddai.&nbsp; They



<P>sent it once, and twice, and thrice; not knowing but that at



<P>some times there might be in Mansoul some willingness to



<P>surrender up themselves unto them, might they but have the



<P>colour of an invitation to do it under.&nbsp; Yea, so far as I



<P>could gather, the town had been surrendered up to them before



<P>now, had it not been for the opposition of old Incredulity,



<P>and the fickleness of the thoughts of my Lord Willbewill.



<P>Diabolus also began to rave; wherefore Mansoul, as to



<P>yielding, was not yet all of one mind; therefore they still



<P>lay distressed under these perplexing fears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I told you but now that they of the King's army had this



<P>winter sent three times to Mansoul to submit herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The first time the trumpeter went he went with words of



<P>peace, telling them that the captains, the noble captains of



<P>Shaddai, did pity and bewail the misery of the now perishing



<P>town of Mansoul, and were troubled to see them so much to



<P>stand in the way of their own deliverance.&nbsp; He said,



<P>moreover, that the captains bid him tell them, that if now



<P>poor Mansoul would humble herself and turn, her former



<P>rebellions and most notorious treasons should by their



<P>merciful King be forgiven them, yea, and forgotten too.&nbsp; And



<P>having bid them beware that they stood not in their own way,



<P>that they opposed not themselves, nor made themselves their



<P>own losers, he returned again into the camp.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The second time the trumpeter went, he did treat them a



<P>little more roughly; for, after sound of trumpet, he told



<P>them that their continuing in their rebellion did but chafe



<P>and heat the spirit of the captains, and that they were



<P>resolved to make a conquest of Mansoul, or to lay their bones



<P>before the town walls.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He went again the third time, and dealt with them yet more



<P>roughly; telling them that now, since they had been so



<P>horribly profane, he did not know, not certainly know,



<P>whether the captains were inclining to mercy or judgment.



<P>'Only,' said he, 'they commanded me to give you a summons to



<P>open the gates unto them.'&nbsp; So he returned, and went into the



<P>camp.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These three summonses, and especially the last two, did so



<P>distress the town that they presently call a consultation,



<P>the result of which was this - That my Lord Willbewill should



<P>go up to Ear-gate, and there, with sound of trumpet, call to



<P>the captains of the camp for a parley.&nbsp; Well, the Lord



<P>Willbewill sounded upon the wall; so the captains came up in



<P>their harness, with their ten thousands at their feet.&nbsp; The



<P>townsmen then told the captains that they had heard and



<P>considered their summons, and would come to an agreement with



<P>them, and with their King Shaddai, upon such certain terms,



<P>articles, and propositions as, with and by the order of their



<P>prince, they to them were appointed to propound; to wit, they



<P>would agree upon these grounds to be one people with them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1. If that those of their own company, as the now Lord Mayor



<P>and their Mr. Forget-Good, with then brave Lord Willbewill,



<P>might, under Shaddai, be still the governors of the town,



<P>castle, and gates of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2. Provided that no man that now serveth under their great



<P>giant Diabolus be by Shaddai cast out of house, harbour, or



<P>the freedom that he hath hitherto enjoyed in the famous town



<P>of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3. That it shall be granted them, that they of the town of



<P>Mansoul shall enjoy certain of their rights and privileges;



<P>to wit, such as have formerly been granted them, and that



<P>they have long lived in the enjoyment of, under the reign of



<P>their king Diabolus, that now is, and long has been, their



<P>only lord and great defender.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>4. That no new law, officer, or executioner of law or office,



<P>shall have any power over them, without their own choice and



<P>consent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'These be our propositions, or conditions of peace; and upon



<P>these terms,' said they, 'we will submit to your King.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But when the captains had heard this weak and feeble offer of



<P>the town of Mansoul, and their high and bold demands, they



<P>made to them again, by their noble captain, the Captain



<P>Boanerges, this speech following:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'O ye inhabitants of the town of Mansoul, when I heard your



<P>trumpet sound for a parley with us, I can truly say I was



<P>glad; but when you said you were willing to submit yourselves



<P>to our King and Lord, then I was yet more glad; but when, by



<P>your silly provisos and foolish cavils, you laid the



<P>stumbling-block of your iniquity before your own faces, then



<P>was my gladness turned into sorrows, and my hopeful



<P>beginnings of your return, into languishing fainting fears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I count that old Ill-Pause, the ancient enemy of Mansoul,



<P>did draw up those proposals that now you present us with as



<P>terms of an agreement; but they deserve not to be admitted to



<P>sound in the ear of any man that pretends to have service for



<P>Shaddai.&nbsp; We do therefore jointly, and that with the highest



<P>disdain, refuse and reject such things, as the greatest of



<P>iniquities.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But, O Mansoul, if you will give yourselves into our hands,



<P>or rather into the hands of our King, and will trust him to



<P>make such terms with and for you as shall seem good in his



<P>eyes, (and I dare say they shall be such as you shall find to



<P>be most profitable to you,) then we will receive you, and be



<P>at peace with you; but if you like not to trust yourselves in



<P>the arms of Shaddai our King, then things are but where they



<P>were before, and we know also what we have to do.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then cried out old Incredulity, the Lord Mayor, and said,



<P>'And who, being out of the hands of their enemies, as ye see



<P>we are now, will be so foolish as to put the staff out of



<P>their own hands into the hands of they know not who?&nbsp; I, for



<P>my part, will never yield to so unlimited a proposition.&nbsp; Do



<P>we know the manner and temper of their King?&nbsp; It is said by



<P>some that he will be angry with his subjects if but the



<P>breadth of an hair they chance to step out of the way; and by



<P>others, that he requireth of them much more than they can



<P>perform.&nbsp; Wherefore, it seems, O Mansoul, to be thy wisdom to



<P>take good heed what thou dost in this matter; for if you once



<P>yield, you give up yourselves to another, and so you are no



<P>more your own.&nbsp; Wherefore, to give up yourselves to an



<P>unlimited power, is the greatest folly in the world; for now



<P>you indeed may repent, but can never justly complain.&nbsp; But do



<P>you indeed know, when you are his, which of you he will kill,



<P>and which of you he will save alive; or whether he will not



<P>cut off every one of us, and send out of his own country



<P>another new people, and cause them to inhabit this town?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This speech of the Lord Mayor undid all, and threw flat to



<P>the ground their hopes of an accord.&nbsp; Wherefore the captains



<P>returned to their trenches, to their tents, and to their men,



<P>as they were; and the Mayor to the castle and to his King.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now Diabolus had waited for his return, for he had heard that



<P>they had been at their points.&nbsp; So, when he was come into the



<P>chamber of state, Diabolus saluted him with - 'Welcome, my



<P>lord.&nbsp; How went matters betwixt you to-day?'&nbsp; So the Lord



<P>Incredulity, with a low congee, told him the whole of the



<P>matter, saying, 'Thus and thus said the captains of Shaddai,



<P>and thus and thus said I.'&nbsp; The which when it was told to



<P>Diabolus, he was very glad to hear it, and said, 'My Lord



<P>Mayor, my faithful Incredulity, I have proved thy fidelity



<P>above ten times already, but never yet found thee false.&nbsp; I



<P>do promise thee, if we rub over this brunt, to prefer thee to



<P>a place of honour, a place far better than to be Lord Mayor



<P>of Mansoul.&nbsp; I will make thee my universal deputy, and thou



<P>shalt, next to me, have all nations under thy hand; yea, and



<P>thou shalt lay bands upon them, that they may not resist



<P>thee; nor shall any of our vassals walk more at liberty, but



<P>those that shall be content to walk in thy fetters.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now came the Lord Mayor out from Diabolus, as if he had



<P>obtained a favour indeed.&nbsp; Wherefore to his habitation he



<P>goes in great state, and thinks to feed himself well enough



<P>with hopes, until the time came that his greatness should be



<P>enlarged.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But now, though the Lord Mayor and Diabolus did thus well



<P>agree, yet this repulse to the brave captains put Mansoul



<P>into a mutiny.&nbsp; For while old Incredulity went into the



<P>castle to congratulate his lord with what had passed, the old



<P>Lord Mayor, that was so before Diabolus came to the town, to



<P>wit, my Lord Understanding, and the old Recorder, Mr.



<P>Conscience, getting intelligence of what had passed at Ear-



<P>gate, (for you must know that they might not be suffered to



<P>be at that debate, lest they should then have mutinied for



<P>the captains; but, I say, they got intelligence of what had



<P>passed there, and were much concerned therewith,) wherefore



<P>they, getting some of the town together, began to possess



<P>them with the reasonableness of the noble captains' demands,



<P>and with the bad consequences that would follow upon the



<P>speech of old Incredulity, the Lord Mayor; to wit how little



<P>reverence he showed therein either to the captains or to



<P>their King; also how he implicitly charged them with



<P>unfaithfulness and treachery.&nbsp; 'For what less,' quoth they,



<P>'could be made of his words, when he said he would not yield



<P>to their proposition; and added, moreover, a supposition that



<P>he would destroy us, when before he had sent us word that he



<P>would show us mercy!'&nbsp; The multitude, being now possessed



<P>with the conviction of the evil that old Incredulity had



<P>done, began to run together by companies in all places, and



<P>in every corner of the streets of Mansoul; and first they



<P>began to mutter, then to talk openly, and after that they run



<P>to and fro, and cried as they run, 'Oh the brave captains of



<P>Shaddai! would we were under the government of the captains,



<P>and of Shaddai their King!'&nbsp; When the Lord Mayor had



<P>intelligence that Mansoul was in an uproar, down he comes to



<P>appease the people, and thought to have quashed their heat



<P>with the bigness and the show of his countenance; but when



<P>they saw him, they came running upon him, and had doubtless



<P>done him a mischief, had he not betaken himself to house.



<P>However, they strongly assaulted the house where he was, to



<P>have pulled it down about his ears; but the place was too



<P>strong, so they failed of that.&nbsp; So he, taking some courage,



<P>addressed himself, out at a window, to the people in this



<P>manner:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Gentlemen, what is the reason that there is here such an



<P>uproar to-day?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then answered my Lord Understanding, 'It is even because that



<P>thou and thy master have carried it not rightly, and as you



<P>should, to the captains of Shaddai; for in three things you



<P>are faulty.&nbsp; First, in that you would not let Mr. Conscience



<P>and myself be at the hearing of your discourse.&nbsp; Secondly, in



<P>that you propounded such terms of peace to the captains that



<P>by no means could be granted, unless they had intended that



<P>their Shaddai should have been only a titular prince, and



<P>that Mansoul should still have had power by law to have lived



<P>in all lewdness and vanity before him, and so by consequence



<P>Diabolus should still here be king in power, and the other



<P>only king in name.&nbsp; Thirdly, for that thou didst thyself,



<P>after the captains had showed us upon what conditions they



<P>would have received us to mercy, even undo all again with thy



<P>unsavoury, unseasonable, and ungodly speech.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When old Incredulity had heard this speech, he cried out,



<P>'Treason! treason!&nbsp; To your arms! to your arms!&nbsp; O ye, the



<P>trusty friends of Diabolus in Mansoul.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>UND. - Sir, you may put upon my words what meaning you



<P>please; but I am sure that the captains of such an high lord



<P>as theirs is, deserved a better treatment at your hands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said old Incredulity, 'This is but little better.&nbsp; But,



<P>Sir,' quoth he, 'what I spake I spake for my prince, for his



<P>government, and the quieting of the people, whom by your



<P>unlawful actions you have this day set to mutiny against us.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then replied the old Recorder, whose name was Mr. Conscience,



<P>and said, 'Sir, you ought not thus to retort upon what my



<P>Lord Understanding hath said.&nbsp; It is evident enough that he



<P>hath spoken the truth, and that you are an enemy to Mansoul.



<P>Be convinced, then, of the evil of your saucy and malapert



<P>language, and of the grief that you have put the captains to;



<P>yea, and of the damages that you have done to Mansoul



<P>thereby.&nbsp; Had you accepted of the conditions, the sound of



<P>the trumpet and the alarm of war had now ceased about the



<P>town of Mansoul; but that dreadful sound abides, and your



<P>want of wisdom in your speech has been the cause of it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said old Incredulity, 'Sir, if I live, I will do your



<P>errand to Diabolus, and there you shall have an answer to



<P>your words.&nbsp; Meanwhile we will seek the good of the town, and



<P>not ask counsel of you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>UND. - Sir, your prince and you are both foreigners to



<P>Mansoul, and not the natives thereof; and who can tell but



<P>that, when you have brought us into greater straits, (when



<P>you also shall see that yourselves can be safe by no other



<P>means than by flight,) you may leave us and shift for



<P>yourselves, or set us on fire, and go away in the smoke, or



<P>by the light of our burning, and so leave us in our ruins?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>INCRED. - Sir, you forget that you are under a governor, and



<P>that you ought to demean yourself like a subject; and know



<P>ye, when my lord the king shall hear of this day's work, he



<P>will give you but little thanks for your labour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now while these gentlemen were thus in their chiding words,



<P>down come from the walls and gates of the town the Lord



<P>Willbewill, Mr. Prejudice, old Ill-Pause, and several of the



<P>new-made aldermen and burgesses, and they asked the reason of



<P>the hubbub and tumult; and with that every man began to tell



<P>his own tale, so that nothing could be heard distinctly.



<P>Then was a silence commanded, and the old fox Incredulity



<P>began to speak.&nbsp; 'My lord,' quoth he, 'here are a couple of



<P>peevish gentlemen, that have, as a fruit of their bad



<P>dispositions, and, as I fear, through the advice of one Mr.



<P>Discontent, tumultuously gathered this company against me



<P>this day, and also attempted to run the town into acts of



<P>rebellion against our prince.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then stood up all the Diabolonians that were present, and



<P>affirmed these things to be true.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now when they that took part with my Lord Understanding and



<P>with Mr. Conscience perceived that they were like to come to



<P>the worst, for that force and power was on the other side,



<P>they came in for their help and relief; so a great company



<P>was on both sides.&nbsp; Then they on Incredulity's side would



<P>have had the two old gentlemen presently away to prison; but



<P>they on the other side said they should not.&nbsp; Then they began



<P>to cry up parties again: the Diabolonians cried up old



<P>Incredulity, Forget-Good, the new aldermen, and their great



<P>one Diabolus; and the other party, they as fast cried up



<P>Shaddai, the captains, his laws, their mercifulness, and



<P>applauded their conditions and ways.&nbsp; Thus the bickerment



<P>went awhile; at last they passed from words to blows, and now



<P>there were knocks on both sides.&nbsp; The good old gentleman, Mr.



<P>Conscience, was knocked down twice by one of the



<P>Diabolonians, whose name was Mr. Benumbing; and my Lord



<P>Understanding had like to have been slain with an arquebuse,



<P>but that he that shot did not take his aim aright.&nbsp; Nor did



<P>the other side wholly escape; for there was one Mr. Rashhead,



<P>a Diabolonian, that had his brains beaten out by Mr. Mind,



<P>the Lord Willbewill's servant; and it made me laugh to see



<P>how old Mr. Prejudice was kicked and tumbled about in the



<P>dirt; for though, a while since, he was made captain of a



<P>company of the Diabolonians, to the hurt and damage of the



<P>town, yet now they had got him under their feet, and, I'll



<P>assure you, he had, by some of the Lord Understanding's



<P>party, his crown cracked to boot.&nbsp; Mr. Anything also, he



<P>became a brisk man in the broil; but both sides were against



<P>him, because he was true to none.&nbsp; Yet he had, for his



<P>malapertness, one of his legs broken, and he that did it



<P>wished it had been his neck.&nbsp; Much more harm was done on both



<P>sides, but this must not be forgotten; it was now a wonder to



<P>see my Lord Willbewill so indifferent as he was: he did not



<P>seem to take one side more than another, only it was



<P>perceived that he smiled to see how old Prejudice was tumbled



<P>up and down in the dirt.&nbsp; Also, when Captain Anything came



<P>halting up before him, he seemed to take but little notice of



<P>him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, when the uproar was over, Diabolus sends for my Lord



<P>Understanding and Mr. Conscience, and claps them both up in



<P>prison as the ringleaders and managers of this most heavy,



<P>riotous rout in Mansoul.&nbsp; So now the town began to be quiet



<P>again, and the prisoners were used hardly; yea, he thought to



<P>have made them away, but that the present juncture did not



<P>serve for that purpose, for that war was in all their gates.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But let us return again to our story.&nbsp; The captains, when



<P>they were gone back from the gate, and were come into the



<P>camp again, called a council of war, to consult what was



<P>further for them to do.&nbsp; Now, some said, 'Let us go up



<P>presently, and fall upon the town;' but the greatest part



<P>thought rather better it would be to give them another



<P>summons to yield; and the reason why they thought this to be



<P>best was, because that, so far as could be perceived, the



<P>town of Mansoul now was more inclinable than heretofore.



<P>'And if,' said they, 'while some of them are in a way of



<P>inclination, we should by ruggedness give them distaste, we



<P>may set them further from closing with our summons than we



<P>would be willing they should.'&nbsp; Wherefore to this advice they



<P>agreed, and called a trumpeter, put words into his mouth, set



<P>him his time, and bid him God speed.&nbsp; Well, many hours were



<P>not expired before the trumpeter addressed himself to his



<P>journey.&nbsp; Wherefore, coming up to the wall of the town, he



<P>steereth his course to Ear-gate, and there sounded, as he was



<P>commanded.&nbsp; They then that were within came out to see what



<P>was the matter, and the trumpeter made them this speech



<P>following:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'O hard-hearted and deplorable town of Mansoul, how long wilt



<P>thou love thy sinful, sinful simplicity, and, ye fools,



<P>delight in your scorning?&nbsp; As yet despise you the offers of



<P>peace and deliverance?&nbsp; As yet will ye refuse the golden



<P>offers of Shaddai, and trust to the lies and falsehoods of



<P>Diabolus?&nbsp; Think you, when Shaddai shall have conquered you,



<P>that the remembrance of these your carriages towards him will



<P>yield you peace and comfort, or that by ruffling language you



<P>can make him afraid as a grasshopper?&nbsp; Doth he entreat you



<P>for fear of you?&nbsp; Do you think that you are stronger than he?



<P>Look to the heavens, and behold and consider the stars, how



<P>high are they?&nbsp; Can you stop the sun from running his course,



<P>and hinder the moon from giving her light?&nbsp; Can you count the



<P>number of the stars, or stay the bottles of heaven?&nbsp; Can you



<P>call for the waters of the sea, and cause them to cover the



<P>face of the ground?&nbsp; Can you behold every one that is proud,



<P>and abase him, and bind their faces in secret?&nbsp; Yet these are



<P>some of the works of our King, in whose name this day we come



<P>up unto you, that you may be brought under his authority.&nbsp; In



<P>his name, therefore, I summon you again to yield up



<P>yourselves to his captains.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At this summons the Mansoulians seemed to be at a stand, and



<P>knew not what answer to make.&nbsp; Wherefore Diabolus forthwith



<P>appeared, and took upon him to do it himself; and thus he



<P>begins, but turns his speech to them of Mansoul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Gentlemen,' quoth he, 'and my faithful subjects, if it is



<P>true that this summoner hath said concerning the greatness of



<P>their King, by his terror you will always be kept in bondage,



<P>and so be made to sneak.&nbsp; Yea, how can you now, though he is



<P>at a distance, endure to think of such a mighty one?&nbsp; And if



<P>not to think of him while at a distance, how can you endure



<P>to be in his presence?&nbsp; I, your prince, am familiar with you,



<P>and you may play with me as you would with a grasshopper.



<P>Consider, therefore, what is for your profit, and remember



<P>the immunities that I have granted you.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Farther, if all be true that this man hath said, how comes



<P>it to pass that the subjects of Shaddai are so enslaved in



<P>all places where they come?&nbsp; None in the universe so unhappy



<P>as they, none so trampled upon as they.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Consider, my Mansoul: would thou wert as loath to leave me



<P>as I am loath to leave thee.&nbsp; But consider, I say, the ball



<P>is yet at thy foot; liberty you have, if you know how to use



<P>it; yea, a king you have too, if you can tell how to love and



<P>obey him.'
