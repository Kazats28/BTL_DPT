<I>Song of the Broad-Axe</I></H1></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>





<P>W<FONT SIZE=-1>EAPON</FONT> shapely, naked, wan,

<BR>Head from the mother's bowels drawn,

<BR>Wooded flesh and metal bone, limb only one and lip only one,

<BR>Gray-blue leaf by red-heat grown, helve produced from a little

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seed sown,

<BR>Resting the grass amid and upon,

<BR>To be lean'd and to lean on.



<P>&nbsp;Strong shapes and attributes of strong shapes, masculine trades,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sights and sounds,

<BR>Long varied train of an emblem, dabs of music,

<BR>Fingers of the organist skipping staccato over the keys of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great organ.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>2</CENTER>





<P>Welcome are all earth's lands, each for its kind,

<BR>Welcome are lands of pine and oak,



<P>&nbsp;Welcome are lands of the lemon and fig,

<BR>Welcome are lands of gold,

<BR>Welcome are lands of wheat and maize, welcome those of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grape,

<BR>Welcome are lands of sugar and rice,

<BR>Welcome the cotton-lands, welcome those of the white potato and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweet potato,

<BR>Welcome are mountains, flats, sands, forests, prairies,

<BR>Welcome the rich borders of rivers, table-lands, openings,

<BR>Welcome the measureless grazing-lands, welcome the teeming soil

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of orchards, flax, honey, hemp;

<BR>Welcome just as much the other more hard-faced lands,

<BR>Lands rich as lands of gold or wheat and fruit lands,

<BR>Lands of mines, lands of the manly and rugged ores,

<BR>Lands of coal, copper, lead, tin, zinc,

<BR>Lands of iron&amp;emdash;lands of the make of the axe.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>3</CENTER>





<P>The log at the wood-pile, the axe supported by it,

<BR>The sylvan hut, the vine over the doorway, the space clear'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for a garden,

<BR>The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves after the storm

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is lull'd,

<BR>The wailing and moaning at intervals, the thought of the sea,

<BR>The thought of ships struck in the storm and put on their beam

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ends, and the cutting away of masts,

<BR>The sentiment of the huge timbers of old-fashion'd houses and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; barns,

<BR>The remember'd print or narrative, the voyage at a venture of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men, families, goods,

<BR>The disembarkation, the founding of a new city,

<BR>The voyage of those who sought a New England and found it,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the outset anywhere,

<BR>The settlements of the Arkansas, Colorado, Ottawa, Willamette,

<BR>The slow progress, the scant fare, the axe, rifle, saddle-bags;

<BR>The beauty of all adventurous and daring persons,

<BR>The beauty of wood-boys and wood-men with their clear

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untrimm'd faces,



<P>&nbsp;The beauty of independence, departure, actions that rely on

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; themselves,

<BR>The American contempt for statutes and ceremonies, the boundless

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; impatience of restraint,

<BR>The loose drift of character, the inkling through random types,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the solidification;

<BR>The butcher in the slaughter-house, the hands aboard schooners and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloops, the raftsmen, the pioneer,

<BR>Lumbermen in their winter camp, daybreak in the woods, stripes of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; snow on the limbs of trees, the occasional

snapping,

<BR>The glad clear sound of one's own voice, the merry song, the natural

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life of the woods, the strong day's work,

<BR>The blazing fire at night, the sweet taste of supper, the talk, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bed of hemlock-boughs and the bear-skin;

<BR>The house-builder at work in cities or anywhere,

<BR>The preparatory jointing, squaring, sawing, mortising,

<BR>The hoist-up of beams, the push of them in their places, laying them

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regular,

<BR>Setting the studs by their tenons in the mortises according as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were prepared,

<BR>The blows of mallets and hammers, the attitudes of the men, their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; curv'd limbs,

<BR>Bending, standing, astride the beams, driving in pins, holding on

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by posts and braces,

<BR>The hook'd arm over the plate, the other arm wielding the axe,

<BR>The floor-men forcing the planks close to be nail'd,

<BR>Their postures bringing their weapons downward on the bearers,

<BR>The echoes resounding through the vacant building;

<BR>The huge storehouse carried up in the city well under way,

<BR>The six framing-men, two in the middle and two at each end, carefully

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bearing on their shoulders a heavy stick for

a cross-beam,

<BR>The crowded line of masons with trowels in their right hands rapidly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laying the long side-wall, two hundred feet

from front to rear,

<BR>The flexible rise and fall of backs, the continual click of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trowels striking the bricks,



<P>&nbsp;The bricks one after another each laid so workmanlike in its place,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and set with a knock of the trowel-handle,

<BR>The piles of materials, the mortar on the mortar-boards, and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steady replenishing by the hod-men;

<BR>Spar-makers in the spar-yard, the swarming row of well-grown

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apprentices,

<BR>The swing of their axes on the square-hew'd log shaping it toward

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the shape of a mast,

<BR>The brisk short crackle of the steel driven slantingly into the pine,

<BR>The butter-color'd chips flying off in great flakes and slivers,

<BR>The limber motion of brawny young arms and hips in easy

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; costumes,

<BR>The constructor of wharves, bridges, piers, bulk-heads, floats,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stays against the sea;

<BR>The city fireman, the fire that suddenly bursts forth in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; close-pack'd square,

<BR>The arriving engines, the hoarse shouts, the nimble stepping and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; daring,

<BR>The strong command through the fire-trumpets, the falling in line,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the rise and fall of the arms forcing the

water,

<BR>The slender, spasmic, blue-white jets, the bringing to bear of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hooks and ladders and their execution,

<BR>The crash and cut away of connecting wood-work, or through

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; floors if the fire smoulders under them,

<BR>The crowd with their lit faces watching, the glare and dense

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shadows;

<BR>The forger at his forge-furnace and the user of iron after him,

<BR>The maker of the axe large and small, and the welder and temperer,

<BR>The chooser breathing his breath on the cold steel and trying the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; edge with his thumb,

<BR>The one who clean-shapes the handle and sets it firmly in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the socket;

<BR>The shadowy processions of the portraits of the past users also,

<BR>The primal patient mechanics, the architects and engineers,

<BR>The far-off Assyrian edifice and Mizra edifice,

<BR>The Roman lictors preceding the consuls,

<BR>The antique European warrior with his axe in combat,



<P>&nbsp;The uplifted arm, the clatter of blows on the helmeted head,

<BR>The death-howl, the limpsy tumbling body, the rush of friend

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and foe thither,

<BR>The siege of revolted lieges determin'd for liberty,

<BR>The summons to surrender, the battering at castle gates, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truce and parley,

<BR>The sack of an old city in its time,

<BR>The bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disorderly,

<BR>Roar, flames, blood, drunkenness, madness,

<BR>Goods freely rifled from houses and temples, screams of women

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the gripe of brigands,

<BR>Craft and thievery of camp-followers, men running, old persons

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; despairing,

<BR>The hell of war, the cruelties of creeds,

<BR>The list of all executive deeds and words just or unjust,

<BR>The power of personality just or unjust.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>4</CENTER>





<P>Muscle and pluck forever!

<BR>What invigorates life invigorates death,

<BR>And the dead advance as much as the living advance,

<BR>And the future is no more uncertain than the present,

<BR>For the roughness of the earth and of man encloses as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; much as the delicatesse of the earth and of

man,

<BR>And nothing endures but personal qualities.



<P>&nbsp;What do you think endures?

<BR>Do you think a great city endures?

<BR>Or a teeming manufacturing state? or a prepared constitution?

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the best built steamships?

<BR>Or hotels of granite and iron? or any chef-d' oeuvres of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; engineering, forts, armaments?



<P>&nbsp;Away! these are not to be cherish'd for themselves,

<BR>They fill their hour, the dancers dance, the musicians play

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for them,

<BR>The show passes, all does well enough of course,

<BR>All does very well till one flash of defiance.



<P>&nbsp;A great city is that which has the greatest men and women,

<BR>If it be a few ragged huts it is still the greatest city in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole world.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>5</CENTER>





<P>The place where a great city stands is not the place of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stretch'd wharves, docks, manufactures, deposits

of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; produce merely,

<BR>Nor the place of ceaseless salutes of new-comers or the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anchor-lifters of the departing,

<BR>Nor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings or shops

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; selling goods from the rest of the earth,

<BR>Nor the place of the best libraries and schools, nor the place

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where money is plentiest,

<BR>Nor the place of the most numerous population.



<P>&nbsp;Where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bards,

<BR>Where the city stands that is belov'd by these, and loves them

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in return and understands them,

<BR>Where no monuments exist to heroes but in the common

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; words and deeds,

<BR>Where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place,

<BR>Where the men and women think lightly of the laws,

<BR>Where the slave ceases, and the master of slaves ceases,

<BR>Where the populace rise at once against the never-ending

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; audacity of elected persons,

<BR>Where fierce men and women pour forth as the sea to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whistle of death pours its sweeping and unript

waves,

<BR>Where outside authority enters always after the precedence of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inside authority,

<BR>Where the citizen is always the head and ideal, and President,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mayor, Governor and what not, are agents for

pay,

<BR>Where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; depend on themselves,

<BR>Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs,

<BR>Where speculations on the soul are encouraged,

<BR>Where women walk in public processions in the streets the same

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the men,



<P>&nbsp;Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the men;

<BR>Where the city of the faithfulest friends stands,

<BR>Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands,

<BR>Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands,

<BR>Where the city of the best-bodied mothers stands,

<BR>There the great city stands.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>6</CENTER>





<P>How beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed!

<BR>How the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a man's or woman's look!



<P>&nbsp;All waits or goes by default till a strong being appears;

<BR>A strong being is the proof of the race and of the ability of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the universe,

<BR>When he or she appears materials are overaw'd,

<BR>The dispute on the soul stops,

<BR>The old customs and phrases are confronted, turn'd back,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or laid away.



<P>&nbsp;What is your money-making now? what can it do now?

<BR>What is your respectability now?

<BR>What are your theology, tuition, society, traditions, statute-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; books, now?

<BR>Where are your jibes of being now?

<BR>Where are your cavils about the soul now?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>7</CENTER>





<P>A sterile landscape covers the ore, there is as good as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the best for all the forbidding appearance,

<BR>There is the mine, there are the miners,

<BR>The forge-furnace is there, the melt is accomplish'd, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hammers-men are at hand with their tongs and

hammers,

<BR>What always served and always serves is at hand.



<P>&nbsp;Than this nothing has better served, it has served all,

<BR>Served the fluent-tongued and subtle-sensed Greek, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long ere the Greek,

<BR>Served in building the buildings that last longer than any,



<P>&nbsp;Served the Hebrew, the Persian, the most ancient Hindustanee,

<BR>Served the mound-raiser on the Mississippi, served those whose

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relics remain in Central America,

<BR>Served Albic temples in woods or on plains, with unhewn pillars

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the druids,

<BR>Served the artificial clefts, vast, high, silent, on the snow-cover'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hills of Scandinavia,

<BR>Served those who time out of mind made on the granite walls

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rough sketches of the sun, moon, stars, ships,

ocean waves,

<BR>Served the paths of the irruptions of the Goths, served the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pastoral tribes and nomads,

<BR>Served the long distant Kelt, served the hardy pirates of the Baltic,

<BR>Served before any of those the venerable and harmless men of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ethiopia,

<BR>Served the making of helms for the galleys of pleasure and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making of those for war,

<BR>Served all great works on land and all great works on the sea,

<BR>For the mediaeval ages and before the mediaeval ages,

<BR>Served not the living only then as now, but served the dead.



<P>&nbsp;

<P>I see the European headsman,

<BR>He stands mask'd, clothed in red, with huge legs and strong

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; naked arms,

<BR>And leans on a ponderous axe.



<P>&nbsp;(Whom have you slaughter'd lately European headsman?

<BR>Whose is that blood upon you so wet and sticky?)



<P>&nbsp;I see the clear sunsets of the martyrs,

<BR>I see from the scaffolds the descending ghosts,

<BR>Ghosts of dead lords, uncrown'd ladies, impeach'd ministers,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rejected kings,

<BR>Rivals, traitors, poisoners, disgraced chieftains and the rest.



<P>&nbsp;I see those who in any land have died for the good cause,

<BR>The seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall never run out,



<P>&nbsp;(Mind you O foreign kings, O priests, the crop shall never

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run out.)



<P>&nbsp;I see the blood wash'd entirely away from the axe,

<BR>Both blade and helve are clean,

<BR>They spirt no more the blood of European nobles, they clasp

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no more the necks of queens.



<P>&nbsp;I see the headsman withdraw and become useless,

<BR>I see the scaffold untrodden and mouldy, I see no longer any

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; axe upon it,

<BR>I see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; race, the newest, largest race.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>9</CENTER>





<P>(America! I do not vaunt my love for you,

<BR>I have what I have.)



<P>&nbsp;The axe leaps!

<BR>The solid forest gives fluid utterances,

<BR>They tumble forth, they rise and form,

<BR>Hut, tent, landing, survey,

<BR>Flail, plough, pick, crowbar, spade,

<BR>Shingle, rail, prop, wainscot, jamb, lath, panel, gable,

<BR>Citadel, ceiling, saloon, academy, organ, exhibition-house,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library,

<BR>Cornice, trellis, pilaster, balcony, window, turret, porch,

<BR>Hoe, rake, pitchfork, pencil, wagon, staff, saw, jack-plane,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mallet, wedge, rounce,

<BR>Chair, tub, hoop, table, wicket, vane, sash, floor,

<BR>Work-box, chest, string'd instrument, boat, frame, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what not,

<BR>Capitols of States, and capitol of the nation of States,

<BR>Long stately rows in avenues, hospitals for orphans or for the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poor or sick,

<BR>Manhattan steamboats and clippers taking the measure of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all seas.



<P>&nbsp;The shapes arise!

<BR>Shapes of the using of axes anyhow, and the users and all that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neighbors them,



<P>&nbsp;Cutters down of wood and haulers of it to the Penobscot or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kennebec,

<BR>Dwellers in cabins among the Californian mountains or by the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; little lakes, or on the Columbia,

<BR>Dwellers south on the banks of the Gila or Rio Grande, friendly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gatherings, the characters and fun,

<BR>Dwellers along the St. Lawrence, or north in Kanada, or down

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the Yellowstone, dwellers on coasts and

off coasts,

<BR>Seal-fishers, whalers, arctic seamen breaking passages through

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ice.



<P>&nbsp;The shapes arise!

<BR>Shapes of factories, arsenals, foundries, markets,

<BR>Shapes of the two-threaded tracks of railroads,

<BR>Shapes of the sleepers of bridges, vast frameworks, girders,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arches,

<BR>Shapes of the fleets of barges, tows, lake and canal craft, river

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; craft,

<BR>Ship-yards and dry-docks along the Eastern and Western seas,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and in many a bay and by-place,

<BR>The live-oak kelsons, the pine planks, the spars, the hackmatack-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; roots for knees,

<BR>The ships themselves on their ways, the tiers of scaffolds, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; workmen busy outside and inside,

<BR>The tools lying around, the great auger and little auger, the adze,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bolt, line, square, gouge, and bead-plane.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>10</CENTER>





<P>The shapes arise!

<BR>The shape measur'd, saw'd, jack'd, join'd, stain'd,

<BR>The coffin-shape for the dead to lie within in his shroud,

<BR>The shape got out in posts, in the bedstead posts, in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; posts of the bride's bed,

<BR>The shape of the little trough, the shape of the rockers

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beneath, the shape of the babe's cradle,

<BR>The shape of the floor-planks, the floor-planks for dancer's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feet,

<BR>The shape of the planks of the family home, the home of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; friendly parents and children,



<P>&nbsp;The shape of the roof of the home of the happy young man and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; woman, the roof over the well-married young

man and woman,

<BR>The roof over the supper joyously cook'd by the chaste wife, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; joyously eaten by the chaste husband, content

after his day's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work.



<P>&nbsp;The shapes arise!

<BR>The shape of the prisoner's place in the court-room, and of him

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or her seated in the place.

<BR>The shape of the liquor-bar lean'd against by the young rum-drinker

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the old rum-drinker,

<BR>The shape of the shamed and angry stairs trod by sneaking footsteps,

<BR>The shape of the sly settee, and the adulterous unwholesome couple,

<BR>The shape of the gambling-board with its devilish winnings and losings,

<BR>The shape of the step-ladder for the convicted and sentenced murderer,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the murderer with haggard face and pinion'd

arms,

<BR>The sheriff at hand with his deputies, the silent and white-lipp'd

crowd,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the dangling of the rope.



<P>&nbsp;The shapes arise!

<BR>Shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances,

<BR>The door passing the dissever'd friend flush'd and in haste,

<BR>The door that admits good news and bad news,

<BR>The door whence the son left home confident and puff'd up,

<BR>The door he enter'd again from a long and scandalous absence,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; diseas'd, broken down, without innocence,

without means.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>11</CENTER>





<P>Her shape arises,

<BR>She less guarded than ever, yet more guarded than ever,

<BR>The gross and soil'd she moves among do not make her gross

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and soil'd,

<BR>She knows the thoughts as she passes, nothing is conceal'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from her,



<P>&nbsp;She is none the less considerate or friendly therefor,

<BR>She is the best belov'd, it is without exception, she has no

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reason to fear and she does not fear,

<BR>Oaths, quarrels, hiccupp'd songs, smutty expressions are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; idle to her as she passes,

<BR>She is silent, she is possess'd of herself, they do not offend

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her,

<BR>She receives them as the laws of Nature receive them, she

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is strong,

<BR>She too is a law of Nature &amp;emdash; there is no law stronger

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than she is.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>12</CENTER>





<P>The main shapes arise!

<BR>Shapes of Democracy total, result of centuries,

<BR>Shapes ever projecting other shapes,

<BR>Shapes of turbulent manly cities,

<BR>Shapes of the friends and home-givers of the whole earth,

<BR>Shapes bracing the earth and braced with the whole earth.

<I>Song of the Redwood-Tree</I></H1></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>





<P>A C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALIFORNIA</FONT> song,

<BR>A prophecy and indirection, a thought impalpable to breathe

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as air,

<BR>A chorus of dryads, fading, departing, or hamadryads departing,

<BR>A murmuring, fateful, giant voice, out of the earth and sky,

<BR>Voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Farewell my brethren</I>,

<BR><I>Farewell O earth and sky, farewell ye neighboring waters</I>,

<BR><I>My time has ended, my term has come</I>.



<P>&nbsp;Along the northern coast,

<BR>Just back from the rock-bound shore and the caves,

<BR>In the saline air from the sea in the Mendocino country,

<BR>With the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse,

<BR>With crackling blows of axes sounding musically driven by

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong arms,

<BR>Riven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes, there in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; redwood forest dense,

<BR>I heard the mighty tree its death-chant chanting.



<P>&nbsp;The choppers heard not, the camp shanties echoed not,

<BR>The quick-ear'd teamsters and chain and jack-screw men

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heard not,

<BR>As the wood-spirits came from their haunts of a thousand

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years to join the refrain,

<BR>But in my soul I plainly heard.



<P>&nbsp;Murmuring out of its myriad leaves,

<BR>Down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high,

<BR>Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs, out of its

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foot-thick bark,



<P>&nbsp;That chant of the seasons and time, chant not of the past

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only but the future.



<P>&nbsp;<I>You untold life of me</I>,

<BR><I>And all you venerable and innocent joys</I>,

<BR><I>Perennial hardy life of me with joys 'mid rain and</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many a summer sun</I>,

<BR><I>And the white snows and night and the wild winds</I>;

<BR><I>O the great patient rugged joys, my soul's strong joys</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unreck'd by man</I>,

<BR><I>(For know I bear the soul befitting me, I too have</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consciousness, identity</I>,

<BR><I>And all the rocks and mountains have, and all the earth,)</I>

<BR><I>Joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine</I>,

<BR><I>Our time, our term has come</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Nor yield we mournfully majestic brothers</I>,

<BR><I>We who have grandly fill'd our time</I>;

<BR><I>With Nature's calm content, with tacit huge delight</I>,

<BR><I>We welcome what we wrought for through the past</I>,

<BR><I>And leave the field for them</I>.

<BR><I>For them predicted long</I>,

<BR><I>For a superber race, they too to grandly fill their time</I>,

<BR><I>For them we abdicate, in them ourselves ye forest kings!</I>

<BR><I>In them these skies and airs, these mountain peaks,</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shasta, Nevadas</I>,

<BR><I>These huge precipitious cliffs, this amplitude, these</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; valleys, far Yosemite</I>,

<BR><I>To be in them absorb'd, assimilated</I>.



<P>&nbsp;Then to a loftier strain,

<BR>Still prouder, more ecstatic rose the chant,

<BR>As if the heirs, the deities of the West,

<BR>Joining with master-tongue bore part.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Not wan from Asia's fetiches</I>,

<BR><I>Nor red from Europe's old dynastic slaughter-house</I>,

<BR><I>(Area of murder-plots of thrones, with scent left yet</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of wars and scaffolds everywhere,)</I>

<BR><I>But come from Nature's long and harmless throes,</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; peacefully builded thence</I>,



<P>&nbsp;<I>These virgin lands, lands of the Western shore</I>,

<BR><I>To the new culminating man, to you, the empire new</I>,

<BR><I>You promis'd long, we pledge, we dedicate</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>You occult deep volitions</I>,

<BR><I>You average spiritual manhood, purpose of all, pois'd</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on yourself, giving not taking law</I>,

<BR><I>You womanhood divine, mistress and source of all, whence</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life and love and aught that comes from

life and love</I>,

<BR><I>You unseen moral essence of all the vast materials of</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America, (age upon age working in death

the same as life</I>,)

<BR><I>You that, sometimes known, oftener unknown, really shape and</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mould the New World, adjusting it to Time

and Space</I>,

<BR><I>You hidden national will lying in your abysms, conceal'd</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but ever alert</I>,

<BR><I>You past and present purposes tenaciously pursued, may-be</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unconscious of yourselves</I>,

<BR><I>Unswerv'd by all the passing errors, perturbations of the</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surface</I>;

<BR><I>You vital, universal, deathless germs, beneath all creeds,</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arts, statutes, literatures</I>,

<BR><I>Here build your homes for good, establish here, these areas</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entire, lands of the Western shore</I>,

<BR><I>We pledge, we dedicate to you</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>For man of you, your characteristic race</I>,

<BR><I>Here may he hardy, sweet, gigantic grow, here tower</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proportionate to Nature</I>,

<BR><I>Here climb the vast pure spaces unconfined, uncheck'd by</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wall or roof</I>,

<BR><I>Here laugh with storm or sun, here joy, here patiently inure</I>,

<BR><I>Here heed himself, unfold himself, (not others' formulas</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heed,) here fill his time</I>,

<BR><I>To duly fall, to aid, unreck'd at last</I>,

<BR><I>To disappear, to serve</I>.



<P>&nbsp;Thus on the northern coast,

<BR>In the echo of teamsters' calls and the clinking chains, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the music of choppers' axes,



<P>&nbsp;The falling trunk and limbs, the crash, the muffled shriek,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the groan,

<BR>Such words combined from the redwood-tree, as of voices

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ecstatic, ancient and rustling,

<BR>The century-lasting, unseen dryads, singing, withdrawing,

<BR>All their recesses of forests and mountains leaving,

<BR>From the Cascade range to the Wasatch, or Idaho far, or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utah,

<BR>To the deities of the modern henceforth yielding,

<BR>The chorus and indications, the vistas of coming humanity,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the settlements, features all,

<BR>In the Mendocino woods I caught.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>2</CENTER>





<P>The flashing and golden pageant of California,

<BR>The sudden and gorgeous drama, the sunny and ample lands,

<BR>The long and varied stretch from Puget sound to Colorado

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; south,

<BR>Lands bathed in sweeter, rarer, healthier air, valleys and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mountain cliffs,

<BR>The fields of Nature long prepared and fallow, the silent,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cyclic chemistry,

<BR>The slow and steady ages plodding, the unoccupied surface

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ripening, the rich ores forming beneath;

<BR>At last the New arriving, assuming, taking possession,

<BR>A swarming and busy race settling and organizing everywhere,

<BR>Ships coming in from the whole round world, and going out

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the whole world,

<BR>To India and China and Australia and the thousand island

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paradises of the Pacific,

<BR>Populous cities, the latest inventions, the steamers on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rivers, the railroads, with many a thrifty

farm, with machinery,

<BR>And wood and wheat and the grape, and diggings of yellow gold.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>3</CENTER>





<P>But more in you than these, lands of the Western shore,

<BR>(These but the means, the implements, the standing-ground,)



<P>&nbsp;I see in you, certain to come, the promise of thousands of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, till now deferr'd,

<BR>Promis'd to be fulfill'd, our common kind, the race.



<P>&nbsp;The new society at last, proportionate to Nature,

<BR>In man of you, more than your mountain peaks or stalwart

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trees imperial,

<BR>In woman more, far more, than all your gold or vines, or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even vital air.



<P>&nbsp;Fresh come, to a new world indeed, yet long prepared,

<BR>I see the genius of the modern, child of the real and ideal,

<BR>Clearing the ground for broad humanity, the true America,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heir of the past so grand,

<BR>To build a grander future.

<I>Song of Myself</I></H1></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>





<P>I <FONT SIZE=-1>CELEBRATE</FONT> myself, and sing myself,

<BR>And what I assume you shall assume,

<BR>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.



<P>&nbsp;I loafe and invite my soul,

<BR>I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.



<P>&nbsp;My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this air,

<BR>Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their parents the same,

<BR>I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,

<BR>Hoping to cease not till death.



<P>&nbsp;Creeds and schools in abeyance,

<BR>Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forgotten,

<BR>I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,

<BR>Nature without check with original energy.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>2</CENTER>





<P>Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crowded with perfumes,

<BR>I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,

<BR>The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.



<P>&nbsp;The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distillation, it is odorless,

<BR>It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,

<BR>I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and naked,

<BR>I am mad for it to be in contact with me.



<P>&nbsp;The smoke of my own breath,

<BR>Echoes, ripples, buzz'd whispers, love-root, silk-thread,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crotch and vine,

<BR>My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passing of blood and air through my lungs,

<BR>The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dark-color'd sea-rocks, and of hay in the

barn,

<BR>The sound of the belch'd words of my voice loos'd to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eddies of the wind,

<BR>A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,

<BR>The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wag,

<BR>The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fields and hill-sides,

<BR>The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from bed and meeting the sun.



<P>&nbsp;Have you reckon'd a thousand acres much? have you reckon'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the earth much?

<BR>Have you practis'd so long to learn to read?

<BR>Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?



<P>&nbsp;Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; origin of all poems,

<BR>You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; millions of suns left,)

<BR>You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed

on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spectres in books,

<BR>You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from me,

<BR>You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.



<P>&nbsp;

<P>I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beginning and the end,

<BR>But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.



<P>&nbsp;There was never any more inception than there is now,

<BR>Nor any more youth or age than there is now,

<BR>And will never be any more perfection than there is now,

<BR>Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.



<P>&nbsp;Urge and urge and urge,

<BR>Always the procreant urge of the world.

<BR>Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; substance and increase, always sex,

<BR>Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of life.



<P>&nbsp;To elaborate is no avail, learn'd and unlearn'd feel that it is

so.



<P>&nbsp;Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entretied, braced in the beams,

<BR>Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,

<BR>I and this mystery here we stand.



<P>&nbsp;Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not my soul.



<P>&nbsp;Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,

<BR>Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.



<P>&nbsp;Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,

<BR>Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and

admire myself.



<P>&nbsp;Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hearty and clean,

<BR>Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; less familiar than the rest.



<P>&nbsp;I am satisfied &amp;emdash; I see, dance, laugh, sing;

<BR>As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through the night, and withdraws at the peep

of the day

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with stealthy tread,

<BR>Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; house with their plenty,

<BR>Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at my eyes,

<BR>That they turn from gazing after and down the road,

<BR>And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,

<BR>Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which is ahead?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>4</CENTER>





<P>Trippers and askers surround me,

<BR>People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and city I live in, or the nation,

<BR>The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; old and new,

<BR>My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,

<BR>The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love,

<BR>The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,

<BR>Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; news, the fitful events;

<BR>These come to me days and nights and go from me again,

<BR>But they are not the Me myself.

<BR>Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,

<BR>Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unitary,

<BR>Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certain rest,

<BR>Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,

<BR>Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at it.



<P>&nbsp;Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with linguists and contenders,

<BR>I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>5</CENTER>





<P>I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to you,

<BR>And you must not be abased to the other.



<P>&nbsp;Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,

<BR>Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not even the best,

<BR>Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.



<P>&nbsp;I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; morning,

<BR>How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over upon me,

<BR>And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tongue to my bare-stript heart,

<BR>And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my feet.



<P>&nbsp;Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that pass all the argument of the earth,

<BR>And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own,

<BR>And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,

<BR>And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women my sisters and lovers,



<P>&nbsp;And that a kelson of the creation is love,

<BR>And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,

<BR>And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,

<BR>And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, elder,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mullein and poke-weed.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>6</CENTER>





<P>A child said <I>What is the grass?</I> fetching it to me with full

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hands,

<BR>How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than he.



<P>&nbsp;I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; green stuff woven.



<P>&nbsp;Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,

<BR>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,

<BR>Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may see and remark, and say <I>Whose?</I>



<P>&nbsp;Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vegetation.



<P>&nbsp;Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,

<BR>And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; zones,

<BR>Growing among black folks as among white,

<BR>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same, I receive them the same.



<P>&nbsp;And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.



<P>&nbsp;Tenderly will I use you curling grass,

<BR>It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,

<BR>It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,

<BR>It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soon out of their mothers' laps,

<BR>And here you are the mothers' laps.



<P>&nbsp;This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mothers,

<BR>Darker than the colourless beards of old men,

<BR>Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.



<P>&nbsp;O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,

<BR>And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for nothing.



<P>&nbsp;I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and women,

<BR>And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taken soon out of their laps.



<P>&nbsp;What do you think has become of the young and old men?

<BR>And what do you think has become of the women and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; children?



<P>&nbsp;They are alive and well somewhere,

<BR>The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,

<BR>And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the end to arrest it,

<BR>And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.



<P>&nbsp;All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,

<BR>And to die is different from what any one supposed, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; luckier.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>7</CENTER>





<P>Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?

<BR>I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know it.



<P>&nbsp;I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; babe, and am not contain'd between my hat

and boots,

<BR>And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good,

<BR>The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good.



<P>&nbsp;I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,

<BR>I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fathomless as myself,

<BR>(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)



<P>&nbsp;Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; female,

<BR>For me those that have been boys and that love women,

<BR>For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slighted,



<P>&nbsp;For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the mothers of mothers,

<BR>For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,

<BR>For me children and the begetters of children.



<P>&nbsp;Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,

<BR>I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,

<BR>And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be shaken away.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>8</CENTER>





<P>The little one sleeps in its cradle,

<BR>I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flies with my hand.



<P>&nbsp;The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hill,

<BR>I peeringly view them from the top.



<P>&nbsp;The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,

<BR>I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pistol has fallen.



<P>&nbsp;The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk

of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the promenaders,

<BR>The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the clank of the shod horses on the granite

floor,

<BR>The snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,

<BR>The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous'd mobs,

<BR>The flap of the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside borne to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hospital,

<BR>The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,

<BR>The excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; working his passage to the centre of the crowd,

<BR>The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,

<BR>What groans of over-fed or half-starv'd who fall sunstruck or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in fits,

<BR>What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; home and give birth to babes,



<P>&nbsp;What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; howls restrain'd by decorum,

<BR>Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acceptances, rejections with convex lips,

<BR>I mind them or the show or resonance of them&amp;emdash;I come and

I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; depart.



<P>&nbsp;

<P>The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,

<BR>The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wagon,

<BR>The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,

<BR>The armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.



<P>&nbsp;I am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the load,

<BR>I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,

<BR>I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; timothy,

<BR>And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>10</CENTER>





<P>Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,

<BR>Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,

<BR>In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,

<BR>Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd game,

<BR>Falling asleep on the gather'd leaves with my dog and gun by

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my side.



<P>&nbsp;The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and scud,

<BR>My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the deck.



<P>&nbsp;The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,

<BR>I tuck'd my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good time;

<BR>You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.



<P>&nbsp;I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; west, the bride was a red girl,

<BR>Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smoking, they had moccasins to their feet

and large

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thick blankets hanging from their shoulders,

<BR>On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his luxuriant beard and curls protected his

neck, he held

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his bride by the hand,

<BR>She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs

and reach'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to her feet.



<P>&nbsp;The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,

<BR>I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,

<BR>Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and weak,

<BR>And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him,

<BR>And brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bruis'd feet,

<BR>And gave him a room that enter'd from my own, and gave

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him some coarse clean clothes,

<BR>And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,

<BR>And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ankles;

<BR>He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pass'd north,

<BR>I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean'd in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corner.

<P>Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,

<BR>Twenty-eight young men and all so friendly;

<BR>Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.



<P>&nbsp;She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,

<BR>She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; window.



<P>&nbsp;Which of the young men does she like the best?

<BR>Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.



<P>&nbsp;Where are you off to, lady? for I see you,

<BR>You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.



<P>&nbsp;Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,

<BR>The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.



<P>&nbsp;The beards of the young men glisten'd with wet, it ran from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their long hair,

<BR>Little streams pass'd all over their bodies.



<P>&nbsp;An unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies,

<BR>It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.



<P>&nbsp;The young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast

to them,

<BR>They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bending arch,

<BR>They do not think whom they souse with spray.

<P>The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knife at the stall in the market,

<BR>I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.



<P>&nbsp;Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,

<BR>Each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heat in the fire.



<P>&nbsp;From the cinder-strew'd threshold I follow their movements,

<BR>The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arms,

<BR>Overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so sure,

<BR>They do not hasten, each man hits in his place.

<P>The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swags underneath on its tied-over chain,

<BR>The negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the

string-piece,

<BR>His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over his hip-band,

<BR>His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his hat away from his forehead,

<BR>The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black of his polish'd and perfect limbs.



<P>&nbsp;I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stop there,

<BR>I go with the team also.



<P>&nbsp;In me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as forward sluing,

<BR>To niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; missing,

<BR>Absorbing all to myself and for this song.



<P>&nbsp;Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what is that you express in your eyes?

<BR>It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.



<P>&nbsp;My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distant and day-long ramble,

<BR>They rise together, they slowly circle around.



<P>&nbsp;I believe in those wing'd purposes,

<BR>And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,

<BR>And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,

<BR>And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something else,

<BR>And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pretty well to me,

<BR>And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.

<P>The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,

<BR><I>Ya-honk</I> he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,

<BR>The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,

<BR>Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.



<P>&nbsp;The sharp-hoof'd moose of the north, the cat on the housesill,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the chickadee, the prairie-dog,

<BR>The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,

<BR>The brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wings,

<BR>I see in them and myself the same old law.



<P>&nbsp;The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affections,

<BR>They scorn the best I can do to relate them.



<P>&nbsp;I am enamour'd of growing out-doors,

<BR>Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,

<BR>Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and mauls, and the drivers of horses,

<BR>I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.



<P>&nbsp;What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,

<BR>Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,

<BR>Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,

<BR>Not asking the sky to come down to my good will,

<BR>Scattering it freely forever.

<P>The pure contralto sings in the organ loft,

<BR>(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)

<BR>The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the

<BR>The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his

<P>&nbsp;As the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and extrication,

<BR>And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men and women fully equipt,

<BR>And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them that plot and conspire.

<P>Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,

<BR>Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding.



<P>&nbsp;No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apart from them,

<BR>No more modest than immodest.



<P>&nbsp;Unscrew the locks from the doors!

<BR>Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!



<P>&nbsp;Whoever degrades another degrades me,

<BR>And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.



<P>&nbsp;Through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; current and index.



<P>&nbsp;I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,

<BR>By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; counterpart of on the same terms.



<P>&nbsp;Through me many long dumb voices,

<BR>Voices of the interminable generation of prisoners and slaves,

<BR>Voices of the diseas'd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,

<BR>Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,

<BR>And of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the father-stuff,

<BR>And of the rights of them the others are down upon,

<BR>Of the deform'd, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,

<BR>Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.



<P>&nbsp;Through me forbidden voices,

<BR>Voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil'd and I remove the veil,

<BR>Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur'd.



<P>&nbsp;I do not press my fingers across my mouth,

<BR>I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heart,

<BR>Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.



<P>&nbsp;I believe in the flesh and the appetites,

<BR>Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of me is a miracle.



<P>&nbsp;Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or am touch'd from,

<BR>The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,

<BR>This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.



<P>&nbsp;If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of my own body, or any part of it,

<BR>Translucent mould of me it shall be you!

<BR>Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you!

<BR>Firm masculine colter it shall be you!

<BR>Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!

<BR>You my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life!

<BR>Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!

<BR>My brain it shall be your occult convolutions!

<BR>Root of wash'd sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!

<BR>Mix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!

<BR>Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!

<BR>Sun so generous it shall be you!

<BR>Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!

<BR>You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!

<BR>Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you!

<BR>Broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my winding paths, it shall be you!

<BR>Hands I have taken, face I have kiss'd, mortal I have ever

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; touch'd, it shall be you.



<P>&nbsp;I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,

<BR>Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,

<BR>I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my faintest wish,

<BR>Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; friendship I take again.



<P>&nbsp;That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,

<BR>A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; metaphysics of books.



<P>&nbsp;To behold the day-break!

<BR>The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,

<BR>The air tastes good to my palate.



<P>&nbsp;Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freshly exuding,

<BR>Scooting obliquely high and low.



<P>&nbsp;Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,

<BR>Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.



<P>&nbsp;The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,

<BR>The heav'd challenge from the east that moment over my head,

<BR>The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!



<P>&nbsp;

<P>Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,

<BR>If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.



<P>&nbsp;We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,

<BR>We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day-break.



<P>&nbsp;My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,

<BR>With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of worlds.



<P>&nbsp;Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,

<BR>It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,

<BR><I>Walt you contain enough, why don't you let it out then</I>?



<P>&nbsp;Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; articulation,

<BR>Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; folded?

<BR>Waiting in gloom, protected by frost,

<BR>The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,

<BR>I underlying causes to balance them at last,



<P>&nbsp;My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meaning of all things,

<BR>Happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; search of this day.)



<P>&nbsp;My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; really am,

<BR>Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,

<BR>I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you.



<P>&nbsp;Writing and talk do not prove me,

<BR>I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,

<BR>With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>26</CENTER>





<P>Now I will do nothing but listen,

<BR>To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toward it.



<P>&nbsp;I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals.

<BR>I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,

<BR>I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; following,

<BR>Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day and night,

<BR>Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of work-people at their meals,

<BR>The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sick,

<BR>The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pronouncing a death-sentence,

<BR>The heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the refrain of the anchor-lifters,

<BR>The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with

premonitory

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tinkles and color'd lights,

<BR>The steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cars,



<P>&nbsp;The slow march play'd at the head of the association marching

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two and two,

<BR>(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black muslin.)



<P>&nbsp;I hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's complaint,)

<BR>I hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,

<BR>It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.



<P>&nbsp;I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,

<BR>Ah this indeed is music&amp;emdash;this suits me.



<P>&nbsp;A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,

<BR>The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.



<P>&nbsp;I hear the train'd soprano (what work with hers is this?)

<BR>The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,

<BR>It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,

<BR>It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick'd by the indolent

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waves,

<BR>I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,

<BR>Steep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throttled in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fakes of death,

<BR>At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,

<BR>And that we call Being.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>27</CENTER>





<P>To be in any form, what is that?

<BR>(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thither,)

<BR>If nothing lay more develop'd the quahaug in its callous shell

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were enough.



<P>&nbsp;Mine is no callous shell,

<BR>I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,

<BR>They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.



<P>&nbsp;I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,

<BR>To touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can stand.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>28</CENTER>





<P>Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,

<BR>Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,

<BR>Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,

<BR>My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hardly different from myself,

<BR>On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,

<BR>Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,

<BR>Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,

<BR>Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,

<BR>Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,

<BR>Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pasture-fields,

<BR>Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,

<BR>They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; edges of me,

<BR>No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anger,

<BR>Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,

<BR>Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.



<P>&nbsp;The sentries desert every other part of me,

<BR>They have left me helpless to a red marauder,

<BR>They all come to the headland to witness and assist against

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me.



<P>&nbsp;I am given up by traitors,

<BR>I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; greatest traitor,

<BR>I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there.



<P>&nbsp;You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its throat,

<BR>Unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>29</CENTER>





<P>Blind loving wrestling touch, sheath'd hooded sharp-tooth'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; touch!

<BR>Did it make you ache so, leaving me?



<P>&nbsp;Parting track'd by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loan,

<BR>Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.



<P>&nbsp;Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vital,

<BR>Landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>30</CENTER>





<P>All truths wait in all things,

<BR>They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,

<BR>They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,

<BR>The insignificant is as big to me as any,

<BR>(What is less or more than a touch?)



<P>&nbsp;Logic and sermons never convince,

<BR>The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.



<P>&nbsp;(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,

<BR>Only what nobody denies is so.)



<P>&nbsp;A minute and a drop of me settle my brain,

<BR>I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,

<BR>And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,

<BR>And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each other,

<BR>And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; becomes omnific,

<BR>And until one and all shall delight us, and we them.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>31</CENTER>





<P>I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the stars,

<BR>And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the egg of the wren,

<BR>And the tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest,

<BR>And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,

<BR>And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,



<P>&nbsp;And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statue,

<BR>And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infidels.



<P>&nbsp;I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grains, esculent roots,

<BR>And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,

<BR>And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,

<BR>But call any thing back again when I desire it.



<P>&nbsp;In vain the speeding or shyness,

<BR>In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; approach,

<BR>In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bones,

<BR>In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,

<BR>In vain the ocean setting in hollows and the great monsters

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lying low,

<BR>In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,

<BR>In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,

<BR>In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,

<BR>In vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to Labrador,

<BR>I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cliff.



<P>&nbsp;

<P>I think I could turn and live with animals, they're so placid

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and self-contain'd,

<BR>I stand and look at them long and long.



<P>&nbsp;They do not sweat and whine about their condition,

<BR>They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,

<BR>They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,

<BR>Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; owning things,

<BR>Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of years ago,

<BR>Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.



<P>&nbsp;So they show their relations to me and I accept them,

<BR>They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their possession.



<P>&nbsp;I wonder where they get those tokens,

<BR>Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them?



<P>&nbsp;Myself moving forward then and now and forever,

<BR>Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,

<BR>Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,

<BR>Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,

<BR>Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brotherly terms.



<P>&nbsp;A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; caresses,

<BR>Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,

<BR>Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,

<BR>Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moving.



<P>&nbsp;His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,

<BR>His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and return.

<BR>I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,

<BR>Why do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?

<BR>Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you.



<P>&nbsp;

<P>Space and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess'd at,

<BR>What I guess'd when I loaf'd on the grass,

<BR>What I guess'd while I lay alone in my bed,

<BR>And again as I walk'd the beach under the paling stars of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; morning.



<P>&nbsp;My ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,

<BR>I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,

<BR>I am afoot with my vision.



<P>&nbsp;By the city's quadrangular houses&amp;emdash;in log huts, camping

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with lumbermen,

<BR>Along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bed,

<BR>Weeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,

<BR>Prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purchase,

<BR>Scorch'd ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the shallow river,

<BR>Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the buck turns furiously at the hunter,

<BR>Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the otter is feeding on fish,

<BR>Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,

<BR>Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped

tail;

<BR>Over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower'd cotton

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plant, over the rice in its low moist field,

<BR>Over the sharp-peak'd farm house, with its scallop'd scum

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and slender shoots from the gutters,

<BR>Over the western persimmon, over the long-leav'd corn, over

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the delicate blue-flower flax,

<BR>Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there with the rest,

<BR>Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breeze;

<BR>Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by low scragged limbs,

<BR>Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaves of the brush,

<BR>Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wheatlot,

<BR>Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gold-bug drops through the dark,

<BR>Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flows to the meadow,

<BR>Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shuddering of their hides,



<P>&nbsp;Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall

in festoons

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the rafters;

<BR>Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cylinders,

<BR>Where the human heart beats with terrible throes under its

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ribs,

<BR>Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it myself and looking composedly down,)

<BR>Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,

<BR>Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,

<BR>Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,

<BR>Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,

<BR>Where the half-burn'd brig is riding on unknown currents,

<BR>Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corrupting below;

<BR>Where the dense-starr'd flag is borne at the head of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regiments,

<BR>Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,

<BR>Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; countenance,

<BR>Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outside,

<BR>Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; game of base-ball,

<BR>At he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bull-dances, drinking, laughter,

<BR>At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sucking the juice through a straw,

<BR>At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,

<BR>At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; house-raisings;

<BR>Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; screams, weeps,

<BR>Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are scatter'd, where the brood-cow waits in

the hovel,



<P>&nbsp;Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stud to the mare, where the cock is treading

the hen,

<BR>Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; short jerks,

<BR>Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lonesome prairie,

<BR>Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miles far and near,

<BR>Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long-lived swan is curving and winding,

<BR>Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her near-human laugh,

<BR>Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the high weeds,

<BR>Where band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with their heads out,

<BR>Where burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a cemetery,

<BR>Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trees,

<BR>Where the yellow-crown'd heron comes to the edge of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs,

<BR>Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noon,

<BR>Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walnut-tree over the wall,

<BR>Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaves,

<BR>Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,

<BR>Through the gymnasium, through the curtain'd saloon,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through the office or public hall;

<BR>Pleas'd with the native and pleas'd with the foreign, pleas'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the new and old,

<BR>Pleas'd with the homely woman as well as the handsome,

<BR>Pleas'd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talks melodiously,

<BR>Pleas'd with the tune of the choir of the whitewash'd church,

<BR>Pleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; preacher, impress'd seriously at the camp-meeting;

<BR>Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on

the thick plate glass,



<P>&nbsp;Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clouds, or down a lane or along the beach,

<BR>My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the middle;

<BR>Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek'd bush-boy,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (behind me he rides at the drape of the day,)

<BR>Far from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the moccasin print,

<BR>By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patient,

<BR>Nigh the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; candle;

<BR>Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,

<BR>Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and flickle as any,

<BR>Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,

<BR>Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me a long while,

<BR>Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by my side,

<BR>Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stars,

<BR>Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the diameter of eighty thousand miles,

<BR>Speeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,

<BR>Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its belly,

<BR>Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,

<BR>Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,

<BR>I tread day and night such roads.



<P>&nbsp;I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,

<BR>And look at quintillions ripen'd and look at quintillions green.



<P>&nbsp;I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,

<BR>My course runs below the soundings of plummets.



<P>&nbsp;I help myself to material and immaterial,

<BR>No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.



<P>&nbsp;I anchor my ship for a little while only,

<BR>My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to me.



<P>&nbsp;I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of

brittle and blue.



<P>&nbsp;I ascend to the foretruck,

<BR>I take my place late at night in the crow's-nest,

<BR>We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,

<BR>Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wonderful beauty,

<BR>The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scenery is plain in all directions,

<BR>The white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my fancies toward them,

<BR>We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soon to be engaged,

<BR>We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with still feet and caution,

<BR>Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin'd city,

<BR>The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cities of the globe.



<P>&nbsp;I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,

<BR>I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myself,

<BR>I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.



<P>&nbsp;My voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,

<BR>They fetch my man's body up dripping and drown'd.



<P>&nbsp;I understand the large hearts of heroes,

<BR>The courage of present times and all times,

<BR>How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the steamship, and Death chasing it up and

down the storm,

<BR>How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of days and faithful of nights,

<BR>And chalk'd in large letters on a board, <I>Be of good cheer, we</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will not desert you;</I>



<P>&nbsp;How he follow'd with them and tack'd with them three days

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and would not give it up,

<BR>How he saved the drifting company at last,

<BR>How the lank loose-gown'd women look'd when boated

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the side of their prepared graves,

<BR>How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sharp-lipp'd unshaved men;

<BR>All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,

<BR>I am the man, I suffer'd, I was there.



<P>&nbsp;The disdain and calmness of martyrs,

<BR>The mother of old, condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wood, her children gazing on,

<BR>The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blowing, cover'd with sweat,

<BR>The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; murderous buckshot and the bullets,

<BR>All these I feel or am.



<P>&nbsp;I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,

<BR>Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; marksmen,

<BR>I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ooze of my skin,

<BR>I fall on the weeds and stones,

<BR>The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,

<BR>Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whip-stocks.



<P>&nbsp;Agonies are one of my changes of garments,

<BR>I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; become the wounded person,

<BR>My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.



<P>&nbsp;I am the mash'd fireman with breast-bone broken,

<BR>Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,

<BR>Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comrades,

<BR>I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,

<BR>They have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly life me forth.



<P>&nbsp;I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is

for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my sake,

<BR>Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,

<BR>White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bared of their fire-caps,

<BR>The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.



<P>&nbsp;Distant and dead resuscitate,

<BR>They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clock myself.



<P>&nbsp;I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort's bombardment,

<BR>I am there again.



<P>&nbsp;Again the long roll of the drummers,

<BR>Again the attacking cannon, mortars,

<BR>Again to my listeing ears the cannon responsive.



<P>&nbsp;I take part, I see and hear the whole,

<BR>The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd shots,

<BR>The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,

<BR>Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; repairs,

<BR>The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explosion,

<BR>The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.



<P>&nbsp;Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waves with his hand,

<BR>He gasps through the clot <I>Mind not me&amp;emdash;mind</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash;the entrenchments</I>.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>34</CENTER>





<P>Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,

<BR>(I tell not the fall of Alamo,

<BR>Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,

<BR>The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)

<BR>'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twelve young men.



<P>&nbsp;Retreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; baggage for breastworks,

<BR>Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's, nine

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; times their number, was the price they took

in advance,

<BR>Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,

<BR>They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and seal, gave up their arms and march'd back

prisoners

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of war.



<P>&nbsp;They were the glory of the race of rangers,

<BR>Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,

<BR>Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affectionate,

<BR>Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,

<BR>Not a single one over thirty years of age.



<P>&nbsp;The second First-day morning they were brought out in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; squads and massacred, it was beautiful early

summer,

<BR>The work commenced about five o'clock and was over by

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eight.



<P>&nbsp;None obey'd the command to kneel,

<BR>Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; straight,

<BR>A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dead lay together,

<BR>The maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them there,

<BR>Some half-kill'd attempted to crawl away,

<BR>These were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blunts of muskets.

<BR>A youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more came to release him,

<BR>The three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's blood.



<P>&nbsp;At eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies;

<BR>That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; young men.



<P>&nbsp;

<P>Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?

<BR>Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?

<BR>List to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to me.



<P>&nbsp;Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)

<BR>His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truer, and never was, and never will be;

<BR>Along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us.



<P>&nbsp;We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd,

<BR>My captain lash'd fast with his own hands.



<P>&nbsp;We had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water,

<BR>On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.



<P>&nbsp;Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,

<BR>Ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gain, and five feet of water reported,

<BR>The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after-hold to give them a chance for themselves.



<P>&nbsp;The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,

<BR>They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.



<P>&nbsp;Our frigate takes fire,

<BR>The other asks if we demand quarter?

<BR>If our colors are struck and the fighting done?



<P>&nbsp;Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,

<BR><I>We have not struck</I>, he composedly cries, <I>we have just begun</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our part of the fighting</I>.



<P>&nbsp;Only three guns are in use,

<BR>One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main-mast,

<BR>Two well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and clear his decks.



<P>&nbsp;The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the main-top,

<BR>They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.



<P>&nbsp;Not a moment's cease,

<BR>The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powder-magazine.



<P>&nbsp;One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we are sinking.



<P>&nbsp;Serene stands the little captain,

<BR>He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,

<BR>His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.



<P>&nbsp;Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to us.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>36</CENTER>





<P>Stretch'd and still lies the midnight,

<BR>Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,

<BR>Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the one we have conquer'd,

<BR>The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through a countenance white as a sheet,

<BR>Near by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin,

<BR>The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carefully curl'd whiskers,

<BR>The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; below,

<BR>The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,

<BR>Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flesh upon the masts and spars,

<BR>Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of waves,

<BR>Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scent,

<BR>A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,

<BR>Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the shore, death-messages given in charge

to survivors,



<P>&nbsp;The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,

<BR>Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long, dull, tapering groan,

<BR>These so, these irretrievable.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>37</CENTER>





<P>You laggards there on guard! look to your arms!

<BR>In at the conquer'd doors they crowd! I am possess'd!

<BR>Embody all presences outlaw'd or suffering,

<BR>See myself in prison shaped like another man,

<BR>And feel the dull unintermitted pain,

<BR>For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep watch,

<BR>It is I let out in the morning and barr'd at night.



<P>&nbsp;Not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but I am handcuff'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to him and walk by his side,

<BR>(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweat on my twitching lips.)



<P>&nbsp;Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tried and sentenced.



<P>&nbsp;Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at

the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; last gasp,

<BR>My face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl, away from me

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people retreat.



<P>&nbsp;Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,

<BR>I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>38</CENTER>





<P>Enough! enough! enough!

<BR>Somehow I have been stunn'd. Stand back!

<BR>Give me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dreams, gaping,

<BR>I discover myself on the verse of a usual mistake.



<P>&nbsp;That I could forget the mockers and insults!

<BR>That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bludgeons and hammers!

<BR>That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bloody crowning!



<P>&nbsp;I remember now,

<BR>I resume the overstaid fraction,

<BR>The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to any graves,

<BR>Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.



<P>&nbsp;I troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; average unending procession,

<BR>Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,

<BR>Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,

<BR>The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years.



<P>&nbsp;Eleves, I salute you! come forward!

<BR>Continue your annotations, continue your questionings.

<P>The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?

<BR>Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?



<P>&nbsp;Is he some Southwesterner rais'd out-doors? is he Kanadian?

<BR>Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?

<BR>The mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?



<P>&nbsp;Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,

<BR>They desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stay with them.



<P>&nbsp;Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uncomb'd head, laughter, and naivet&egrave;,

<BR>Slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; emanations,

<BR>They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,



<P>&nbsp;They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out of the glance of his eyes.



<P>&nbsp;

<P>Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask&amp;emdash;lie over!

<BR>You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.



<P>&nbsp;Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,

<BR>Say, old top-knot, what do you want?



<P>&nbsp;Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,

<BR>And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,

<BR>And might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; days.



<P>&nbsp;Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,

<BR>When I give I give myself.



<P>&nbsp;You there, impotent, loose in the knees,

<BR>Open your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within you,

<BR>Spread your palms and life the flaps of your pockets,

<BR>I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spare,

<BR>And any thing I have I bestow.



<P>&nbsp;I do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,

<BR>You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you.



<P>&nbsp;To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,

<BR>On his right cheek I put the family kiss,

<BR>And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.



<P>&nbsp;On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; babes,

<BR>(This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; republics.)



<P>&nbsp;To any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; door,



<P>&nbsp;Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,

<BR>Let the physician and the priest go home.



<P>&nbsp;I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,

<BR>O despairer, here is my neck,

<BR>By God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon me.



<P>&nbsp;I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,

<BR>Every room of the house do I fill with an arm'd force,

<BR>Lovers of me, bafflers of graves.



<P>&nbsp;Sleep&amp;emdash;I and they keep guard all night,

<BR>Not doubt, not disease shall dare to lay finger upon you,

<BR>I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,

<BR>And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you is so.

<P>I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,

<BR>And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.



<P>&nbsp;I heard what was said of the universe,

<BR>Heard it and heard it of several thousand years;

<BR>It is middling well as far as it goes&amp;emdash;but is that all?



<P>&nbsp;Magnifying and applying come I,

<BR>Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,

<BR>Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,

<BR>Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,

<BR>Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,

<BR>In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crucifix engraved,

<BR>With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; image,

<BR>Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,

<BR>Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days,

<BR>(They bore mites as for unfledg'd birds who have now to rise

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fly and sing for themselves,)



<P>&nbsp;Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bestowing them freely on each man and woman

I see,

<BR>Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,

<BR>Putting higher claims for him there with his roll'd-up sleeves

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; driving the mallet and chisel,

<BR>Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just

as curious

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as any revelation,

<BR>Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to me than the gods of the antique wars,

<BR>Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,

<BR>Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr'd laths, their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the

flames;

<BR>By the mechanic's wife with her babe at her nipple

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interceding for every person born,

<BR>Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; angels with shirts bagg'd out at their waists,

<BR>The snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to come,

<BR>Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his brother and sit by him while he is tried

for forgery;

<BR>What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about me, and not filling the square rod then,

<BR>The bull and the bug never worshipp'd half enough,

<BR>Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream'd,

<BR>The supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be one of the supremes,

<BR>The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the best, and be as prodigious;

<BR>By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator,

<BR>Putting myself here and now to the ambush'd womb of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shadows.

<P>A call in the midst of the crowd,

<BR>My own voice, orotund sweeping and final.



<P>&nbsp;Come my children,

<BR>Come my boys and girls, my women, household and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intimates,



<P>&nbsp;Now the performer launches his nerve, he has pass'd his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prelude on the reeds within.



<P>&nbsp;Easily written loose-finger'd chords&amp;emdash;I feel the thrum

of your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; climax and close.



<P>&nbsp;My head slues round on my neck,

<BR>Music rolls, but not from the organ,

<BR>Folks are around me, but they are no household of mine.



<P>&nbsp;Ever the hard unsunk ground,

<BR>Ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sun, ever the air and the ceaseless tides,

<BR>Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,

<BR>Ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn'd thumb,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that breath of itches and thirsts,

<BR>Ever the vexer's <I>hoot! hoot</I>! till we find where the sly one

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hides and bring him forth,

<BR>Ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,

<BR>Ever the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.



<P>&nbsp;Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking,

<BR>To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,

<BR>Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going,

<BR>Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; payment receiving,

<BR>A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.



<P>&nbsp;This is the city and I am one of the citizens,

<BR>Whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; markets, newspapers, schools,

<BR>The mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stocks, stores, real estate and personal estate.



<P>&nbsp;The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tail'd coats,

<BR>I am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fleas,)

<BR>I acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shallowest is deathless with me,



<P>&nbsp;What I do and say the same waits for them,

<BR>Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them.



<P>&nbsp;I know perfectly well my own egotism,

<BR>Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less,

<BR>And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.



<P>&nbsp;Not words of routine this song of mine,

<BR>But abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;

<BR>This printed and bound book&amp;emdash;but the printer and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printing-office boy?

<BR>The well-taken photographs&amp;emdash;but your wife or friend close

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and solid in your arms?

<BR>The black ship mail'd with iron, her mighty guns in her

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turrets&amp;emdash;but the pluck of the captain

and engineers?

<BR>In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture&amp;emdash;but the

host

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and hostess, and the look out of their eyes?

<BR>The sky up there&amp;emdash;yet here or next door, or across the way?

<BR>The saints and sages in history&amp;emdash;but you yourself?

<BR>Sermons, creeds, theology&amp;emdash;but the fathomless human brain,

<BR>And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?

<P>I do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,

<BR>Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sun,

<BR>Making a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sticks in the circle of obis,

<BR>Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,

<BR>Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and austere in the woods a gymnosophist,

<BR>Drinking mead from the skull-cup, to Shastas and Vedas

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; admirant, minding the Koran,



<P>&nbsp;Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knife, beating the serpent-skin drum,

<BR>Accepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knowing assuredly that he is divine,

<BR>To the mass kneeling or the puritan's prayer rising, or sitting

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patiently in a pew,

<BR>Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; till my spirit arouses me,

<BR>Looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and land,

<BR>Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.



<P>&nbsp;One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a man leaving charges before a journey.



<P>&nbsp;Down-hearted doubters dull and excluded,

<BR>Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; atheistical,

<BR>I know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; despair and unbelief.



<P>&nbsp;How the flukes splash!

<BR>How they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of blood!



<P>&nbsp;Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,

<BR>I take my place among you as much as among any,

<BR>The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,

<BR>And what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precisely the same.



<P>&nbsp;I do not know what is untried and afterward,

<BR>But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.



<P>&nbsp;Each who passes is consider'd, each who stops is consider'd,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not a single one can it fail.



<P>&nbsp;It cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,

<BR>Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side,

<BR>Nor the little child that peep'd in at the door, and then drew

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back and was never seen again,



<P>&nbsp;Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with bitterness worse than gall,

<BR>Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder,

<BR>Nor the numberless slaughter'd and wreck'd, nor the brutish

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; koboo call'd the ordure of humanity,

<BR>Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slip in,

<BR>Nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the earth,

<BR>Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myriads that inhabit them,

<BR>Nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.

<P>It is time to explain myself&amp;emdash;let us stand up.



<P>&nbsp;What is known I strip away,

<BR>I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.



<P>&nbsp;The clock indicates the moment&amp;emdash;but what does eternity

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indicate?



<P>&nbsp;We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,

<BR>There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.



<P>&nbsp;Births have brought us richness and variety,

<BR>And other births will bring us richness and variety.



<P>&nbsp;I do not call one greater and one smaller,

<BR>That which fills its period and place is equal to any.



<P>&nbsp;Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my sister?

<BR>I am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,

<BR>All has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,

<BR>(What have I to do with lamentation?)



<P>&nbsp;I am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I an encloser of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things to be.



<P>&nbsp;My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,

<BR>On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the steps,

<BR>All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.



<P>&nbsp;Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,

<BR>Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there,

<BR>I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mist,

<BR>And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.



<P>&nbsp;Long I was hugg'd close&amp;emdash;long and long.



<P>&nbsp;Immense have been the preparations for me,

<BR>Faithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.



<P>&nbsp;Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boatmen,

<BR>For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,

<BR>They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.



<P>&nbsp;Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me,

<BR>My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.



<P>&nbsp;For it the nebula cohered to an orb,

<BR>The long slow strata piled to rest it on,

<BR>Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,

<BR>Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it with care.



<P>&nbsp;All forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight

me,

<BR>Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>45</CENTER>





<P>O span of youth! ever-push'd elasticity!

<BR>O manhood, balanced, florid and full.



<P>&nbsp;My lovers suffocate me,

<BR>Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,

<BR>Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me at night,

<BR>Crying by day <I>Ahoy</I>! from the rocks of the river, swinging

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and chirping over my head,

<BR>Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,

<BR>Lighting on every moment of my life,

<BR>Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,

<BR>Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them to be mine.



<P>&nbsp;Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; days!



<P>&nbsp;Every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grows after and out of itself,

<BR>And the dark hush promulges as much as any.



<P>&nbsp;I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,

<BR>And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rim of the farther systems.



<P>&nbsp;Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,

<BR>Outward and outward and forever outward.



<P>&nbsp;My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,

<BR>He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,

<BR>And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them.



<P>&nbsp;There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,

<BR>If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were this moment reduced back to a pallid

float, it would

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not avail in the long run,

<BR>We should surely bring up again where we now stand,

<BR>And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.



<P>&nbsp;A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do not hazard the span or make it impatient,

<BR>They are but parts, any thing is but a part.



<P>&nbsp;See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,

<BR>Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.



<P>&nbsp;My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,

<BR>The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,

<BR>The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>46</CENTER>





<P>I know I have the best of time and space, and was never

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; measured and never will be measured.



<P>&nbsp;I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)

<BR>My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the woods,

<BR>No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,

<BR>I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,

<BR>I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,

<BR>But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,

<BR>My left hand hooking you round the waist,

<BR>My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public road.



<P>&nbsp;Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,

<BR>You must travel it for yourself.



<P>&nbsp;It is not far, it is within reach,

<BR>Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know,

<BR>Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.



<P>&nbsp;Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hasten forth,

<BR>Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.



<P>&nbsp;If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand on my hip,

<BR>And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,

<BR>For after we start we never lie by again.



<P>&nbsp;This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look'd at the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crowded heaven,

<BR>And I said to my spirit <I>When we become the enfolders of those</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of

every thing in</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them, shall we be fill'd and satisfied

then</I>?

<BR>And my spirit said <I>No, we but level that lift to pass and</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue beyond</I>.



<P>&nbsp;You are also asking me questions and I hear you,

<BR>I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.



<P>&nbsp;Sit a while dear son,

<BR>Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,

<BR>But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the

gate for your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; egress hence.



<P>&nbsp;Long enough have you dream'd contemptible dreams,

<BR>Now I wash the gum from your eyes,

<BR>You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every moment of your life.



<P>&nbsp;Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,

<BR>Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,

<BR>To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shout, and laughingly dash with your hair.

<P>I am the teacher of athletes,

<BR>He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the width of my own,

<BR>He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; teacher.



<P>&nbsp;The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; power, but in his own right,

<BR>Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,

<BR>Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,

<BR>Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steel cuts,



<P>&nbsp;First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a

skiff,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to sing a song or play on the banjo,

<BR>Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; small-pox over all latherers,

<BR>And those well-tann'd to those that keep out of the sun.



<P>&nbsp;I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?

<BR>I follow you whoever you are from the present hour,

<BR>My words itch at your ears till you understand them.



<P>&nbsp;I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while I wait for a boat,

<BR>(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you,

<BR>Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen'd.)



<P>&nbsp;I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; house,

<BR>And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her who privately stays with me in the open

air.



<P>&nbsp;If you would understand me go to the heights or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; water-shore,

<BR>The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waves a key,

<BR>The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.



<P>&nbsp;No shutter'd room or school can commune with me,

<BR>But roughs and little children better than they.



<P>&nbsp;The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,

<BR>The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me with him all day,

<BR>The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of my voice,

<BR>In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seamen and love them.



<P>&nbsp;The soldier camp'd or upon the march is mine,

<BR>On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not fail them,



<P>&nbsp;On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me seek me.



<P>&nbsp;My face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies down alone in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his blanket,

<BR>The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,

<BR>The young mother and old mother comprehend me,

<BR>The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where they are,

<BR>They and all would resume what I have told them.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>48</CENTER>





<P>I have said that the soul is not more than the body,

<BR>And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,

<BR>And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,

<BR>And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own funeral drest in his shroud,

<BR>And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the earth,

<BR>And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confounds the learning of all times,

<BR>And there is no trade or employment but the young man

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; following it may become a hero,

<BR>And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wheel'd universe,

<BR>And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and composed before a million universes.



<P>&nbsp;And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,

<BR>For I who am curious about each am not curious about

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God,

<BR>(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God and about death.)



<P>&nbsp;I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not in the least,

<BR>Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myself.



<P>&nbsp;Why should I wish to see God better than this day?

<BR>I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each moment then,

<BR>In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; face in the glass,

<BR>I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sign'd by God's name,

<BR>And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go,

<BR>Others will punctually come for ever and ever.



<P>&nbsp;

<P>And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; idle to try to alarm me.



<P>&nbsp;To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,

<BR>I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,

<BR>I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,

<BR>And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.



<P>&nbsp;And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not offend me,

<BR>I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,

<BR>I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; melons.



<P>&nbsp;And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deaths,

<BR>(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)



<P>&nbsp;I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,

<BR>O suns&amp;emdash;O grass of graves&amp;emdash;O perpetual transfers

and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; promotions,

<BR>If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?



<P>&nbsp;Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,

<BR>Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twilight,

<BR>Toss, sparkles of day and dusk&amp;emdash;toss on the black stems that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decay in the muck,

<BR>Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.



<P>&nbsp;I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,

<BR>I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reflected,

<BR>And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great or small.

<P>There is that in me&amp;emdash;I do not know what it is&amp;emdash;but

I know it

<P>&nbsp;Wrench'd and sweaty&amp;emdash;calm and cool then my body becomes,

<BR>I sleep&amp;emdash;I sleep long.



<P>&nbsp;I do not know it&amp;emdash;it is without name&amp;emdash;it is

a word unsaid,

<BR>It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.



<P>&nbsp;Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,

<BR>To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.



<P>&nbsp;Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sisters.



<P>&nbsp;Do you see O my brothers and sisters?

<BR>It is not chaos or death&amp;emdash;it is form, union, plan&amp;emdash;it

is eternal

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life&amp;emdash;it is Happiness.



<P>&nbsp;

<P>The past and present wilt&amp;emdash;I have fill'd them, emptied them,

<BR>And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.



<P>&nbsp;Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?

<BR>Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,

<BR>(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; minute longer.)



<P>&nbsp;Do I contradict myself?

<BR>Very well then I contradict myself,

<BR>(I am large, I contain multitudes.)



<P>&nbsp;I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.



<P>&nbsp;Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with his supper?

<BR>Who wishes to walk with me?



<P>&nbsp;Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; late?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>52</CENTER>





<P>The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of my gab and my loitering.



<P>&nbsp;I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,

<BR>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.



<P>&nbsp;The last scud of day holds back for me,

<BR>It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shadow'd wilds,

<BR>It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.



<P>&nbsp;I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,

<BR>I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.



<P>&nbsp;I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,

<BR>If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.



<P>&nbsp;You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,

<BR>But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,

<BR>And filter and fibre your blood.



<P>&nbsp;Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,

<BR>Missing me one place search another,

<BR>I stop somewhere waiting for you.

As I ponder'd in silence,

<BR>A Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect,

<BR>Terrible in beauty, age, and power,

<BR>The genius of poets of old lands,

<BR>As to me directing like flame its eyes,

<BR>With finger pointing to many immortal songs,

<BR>And menacing voice, <I>What singest thou</I>? it said,

<BR><I>Know'st thou not there is but one theme for ever-enduring bards</I>?

<BR><I>And that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles</I>,

<BR><I>The making of perfect soldiers</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Be it so</I>, then I answer'd,

<BR><I>I too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer and greater one</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than any</I>,

IN CABIN'D SHIPS AT SEA</H2></CENTER>

I<FONT SIZE=-1>N</FONT> cabin'd ships at sea,

<BR>The boundless blue on every side expanding,

<BR>Or some lone bark buoy'd on the dense marine,

<BR>Where joyous full of faith, spreading white sails,

<BR>She cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day, or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under many a star at night,

<BR>By sailors young and old haply will I, a reminiscence of the

<BR>In full rapport at last.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Here are our thoughts, voyagers' thoughts</I>,

<BR><I>Here not the land, firm land, alone appears</I>, may then by them

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rhythm</I>,

<BR><I>The boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here</I>,

<BR><I>And this is ocean's poem</I>.



<P>&nbsp;Then falter not O book, fulfil your destiny,

<BR>You not a reminiscence of the land alone,

<BR>You too as a lone bark cleaving the ether, purpos'd I know

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not whither, yet ever full of faith,

<BR>Consort to every ship that sails, sail you!

<BR>Bear forth to them folded my love, (dear mariners, for you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fold it here in every leaf;)



<P>&nbsp;Speed on my book! spread your white sails my little bark

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; athwart the imperious waves,

<BR>Chant on, sail on, bear o'er the boundless blue from me to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every sea,

<BR>This song for mariners and all their ships.

POETS TO COME</H2></CENTER>

P<FONT SIZE=-1>OETS</FONT> to come! orators, singers, musicians to come!

<BR>Not to-day is to justify me and answer what I am for,

<BR>But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than before known,

<BR>Arouse! for you must justify me.



<P>&nbsp;I myself but write one or two indicative words for the future,

<BR>I but advance a moment only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness.



<P>&nbsp;I am a man who, sauntering along without fully stopping,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turns a casual look upon you and then averts his

face,

<BR>Leaving it to you to prove and define it,

<BR>Expecting the main things from you.

<P>(A<FONT SIZE=-1>H</FONT> little recks the laborer,

<BR>How near his work is holding him to God,

<BR>The loving Laborer through space and time.)



<P>&nbsp;After all not to create only, or found only,

<BR>But to bring perhaps from afar what is already

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; founded,

<BR>To give it our own identity, average, limitless, free,

<BR>To fill the gross the torpid bulk with vital religious

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire,

<BR>Not to repel or destroy so much as accept, fuse, rehabilitate,

<BR>To obey as well as command, to follow more than to lead,

<BR>These also are the lessons of our New World;

<BR>While how little the New after all, how much the Old,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old World!



<P>&nbsp;Long and long has the grass been growing,

<BR>Long and long has the rain been falling,

<BR>Long has the globe been rolling round.



<P>&nbsp;

<P>Come Muse migrate from Greece and Ionia,

<BR>Cross out please those immensely overpaid accounts,

<BR>That matter of Troy and Achilles' wrath, and &AElig;neas</q>,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Odysseus' wanderings,

<BR>Placard&nbsp;<qq>Removed</qq> and&nbsp;<qq>To Let</qq> on the rocks

of your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; snowy Parnassus,

<BR>Repeat at Jerusalem, place the notice high on Jaffa's gate

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and on Mount Moriah,

<BR>The same on the walls of your German, French and Spanish

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; castles, and Italian collections,

<BR>For know a better, fresher, busier sphere, a wide, untried

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; domain awaits, demands you.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>3</CENTER>





<P>Responsive to our summons,

<BR>Or rather to her long-nurs'd inclination,

<BR>Join'd with an irresistible, natural gravitation,

<BR>She comes! I hear the rustling of her gown,

<BR>I scent the odor of her breath's delicious fragrance,

<BR>I mark her step divine, her curious eyes a-turning, rolling,

<BR>Upon this very scene.



<P>&nbsp;The dame of dames! can I believe then,

<BR>Those ancient temples, sculptures classic, could none of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them retain her?

<BR>Nor shades of Virgil and Dante, nor myriad memories,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poems, old associations, magnetize and hold

on to her?

<BR>But that she's left them all &amp;emdash; and here?



<P>&nbsp;Yes, if you will allow me to say so,

<BR>I, my friends, if you do not, can plainly see her,

<BR>The same undying soul of earth's, activity's, beauty's,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heroism's expression,

<BR>Out from her evolutions hither come, ended the strata of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her former themes,



<P>&nbsp;Hidden and cover'd by to-day's, foundation of to-day's,

<BR>Ended, deceas'd through time, her voice by Castaly's fountain,

<BR>Silent the broken-lipp'd Sphynx in Egypt, silent all those

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; century-baffling tombs,

<BR>Ended for aye the epics of Asia's, Europe's helmeted warriors,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ended the primitive call of the muses,

<BR>Calliope's call forever closed, Clio, Melpomene, Thalia dead,

<BR>Ended the stately rhythmus of Una and Oriana, ended the quest

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Holy Graal,

<BR>Jerusalem a handful of ashes blown by the wind, extinct,

<BR>The Crusaders' streams of shadowy midnight troops sped with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sunrise,

<BR>Amadis, Tancred, utterly gone, Charlemagne, Roland, Oliver

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gone,

<BR>Palmerin, ogre, departed, vanish'd the turrets that Usk from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its waters reflected,

<BR>Arthur vanish'd with all his knights, Merlin and Lancelot and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Galahad, all gone, dissolv'd utterly like

an exhalation;

<BR>Pass'd! pass'd! for us, forever pass'd, that once so mighty

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world, now void, inanimate, phantom world,

<BR>Embroider'd, dazzling, foreign world, with all its gorgeous

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; legends, myths,

<BR>Its kings and castles proud, its priests and warlike lords

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and courtly dames,

<BR>Pass'd to its charnel vault, coffin'd with crown and armor on,

<BR>Blazon'd with Shakspere's purple page,

<BR>And dirged by Tennyson's sweet sad rhyme.



<P>&nbsp;I say I see, my friends, if you do not, the illustrious emigr&eacute;,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (having it is true in her day, although the

same, changed,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; journey'd considerable,)

<BR>Making directly for this rendezvous, vigorously clearing a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; path for herself, striding through the confusion,

<BR>By thud of machinery and shrill steam-whistle undismay'd,

<BR>Bluff'd not a bit by drain-pipe, gasometers, artificial fertilizers,

<BR>Smiling and pleas'd with palpable intent to stay,

<BR>She's here, install'd amid the kitchen ware!

<P>But hold &amp;emdash; don't I forget my manners?

<BR>To introduce the stranger, (what else indeed do I live to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chant for?) to thee Columbia;

<BR>In liberty's name welcome immortal! clasp hands,

<BR>And ever henceforth sisters dear be both.



<P>&nbsp;Fear not O Muse! truly new ways and days receive,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surround you,

<BR>I candidly confess a queer, queer race, of novel fashion,

<BR>And yet the same old human race, the same within, without,

<BR>Faces and hearts the same, feelings the same, yearnings the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same,

<BR>The same old love, beauty and use the same.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>5</CENTER>





<P>We do not blame thee elder World, nor really separate

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ourselves from thee,

<BR>(Would the son separate himself from the father?)

<BR>Looking back on thee, seeing thee to thy duties, grandeurs,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through past ages bending, building,

<BR>We build to ours to-day.



<P>&nbsp;Mightier than Egypt's tombs,

<BR>Fairer than Grecia's, Roma's temples,

<BR>Prouder then Milan's statued, spired, cathedral,

<BR>More picturesque than Rhenish castle-keeps,

<BR>We plan even now to raise, beyond them all,

<BR>Thy great cathedral sacred industry, no tomb,

<BR>A keep for life for practical invention.



<P>&nbsp;As in a waking vision,

<BR>E'en while I chant I see it rise, I scan and prophesy outside

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and in,

<BR>Its manifold ensemble.



<P>&nbsp;Around a palace, loftier, fairer, ampler than any yet,

<BR>Earth's modern wonder, history's seven outstripping,

<BR>High rising tier on tier with glass and iron fa&ccedil;ades,

<BR>Gladdening the sun and sky, enhued in cheerfulest hues,



<P>&nbsp;Bronze, lilac, robin's-egg, marine and crimson,

<BR>Over whose golden roof shall flaunt, beneath thy banner

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freedom,

<BR>The banners of the States and flags of every land,

<BR>A brood of lofty, fair, but lesser palaces shall cluster.



<P>&nbsp;Somewhere within their walls shall all that forwards perfect

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; human life be started,

<BR>Tried, taught, advanced, visibly exhibited.



<P>&nbsp;Not only all the world of works, trade, products,

<BR>But all the workmen of the world here to be represented.



<P>&nbsp;Here shall you trace in flowing operation,

<BR>In every state of practical, busy movement, the rills of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; civilization,

<BR>Materials here under your eye shall change their shape as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if by magic,

<BR>The cotton shall be pick'd almost in the very field,

<BR>Shall be dried, clean'd, ginn'd, baled, spun into thread

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and cloth before you,

<BR>You shall see hands at work at all the old processes and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the new ones,

<BR>You shall see the various grains and how flour is made and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then bread baked by the bakers,

<BR>You shall see the crude ores of California and Nevada passing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on and on till they become bullion,

<BR>You shall watch how the printer sets type, and learn what a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; composing-stick is,

<BR>You shall mark in amazement the Hoe press whirling its cylinders,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shedding the printed leaves steady and fast,

<BR>The photograph, model, watch, pin, nail, shall be created

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before you.



<P>&nbsp;In large calm halls, a stately museum shall teach you the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infinite lessons of minerals,

<BR>In another, woods, plants, vegetation shall be illustrated

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash; in another animals, animal life

and development.



<P>&nbsp;One stately house shall be the music house,

<BR>Others for other arts &amp;emdash; learning, the sciences, shall

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all be here,



<P>&nbsp;None shall be slighted, none but shall here be honor'd,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help'd, exampled.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>6</CENTER>





<P>(This, this and these, America, shall be <I>your</I> pyramids and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obelisks,

<BR>Your Alexandrian Pharos, gardens of Babylon,

<BR>Your temple at Olympia.)



<P>&nbsp;The male and female many laboring not,

<BR>Shall ever here confront the laboring many,

<BR>With precious benefits to both, glory to all,

<BR>To thee America, and thee eternal Muse.



<P>&nbsp;And here shall ye inhabit powerful Matrons!

<BR>In your vast state vaster than all the old,

<BR>Echoed through long, long centuries to come,

<BR>To sound of different, prouder songs, with stronger themes,

<BR>Practical, peaceful life, the people's life, the People themselves,

<BR>Lifted, illumin'd, bathed in peace &amp;emdash; elate, secure in peace.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>7</CENTER>





<P>Away with themes of war! away with war itself!

<BR>Hence from my shuddering sight to never more return that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show of blacken'd, mutilated corpses!

<BR>That hell unpent and raid of blood, fit for wild tigers or for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lop-tongued wolves, not reasoning men,

<BR>And in its stead speed industry's campaigns,

<BR>With thy undaunted armies, engineering,

<BR>Thy pennants labor, loosen'd to the breeze,

<BR>Thy bugles sounding loud and clear.



<P>&nbsp;Away with old romance!

<BR>Away with novels, plots and plays of foreign courts,

<BR>Away with love-verses, sugar'd in rhyme, the intrigues,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amours of idlers,

<BR>Fitted for only banquets of the night where dancers to late

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; music slide,

<BR>The unhealthy pleasures, extravagant dissipation of the few,



<P>&nbsp;With perfumes, heat and wine, beneath the dazzling chandeliers.



<P>&nbsp;To you ye reverent sane sisters,

<BR>I raise a voice for far superber themes for poets and for art,

<BR>To exalt the present and the real,

<BR>To teach the average man the glory of his daily walk and trade,

<BR>To sing in songs how exercise and chemical life are never to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be baffled,

<BR>To manual work for each and all, to plough, hoe, dig,

<BR>To plant and tend the tree, the berry, vegetables, flowers,

<BR>For every man to see to it that he really do something, for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every woman too;

<BR>To use the hammer and the saw, (rip, or cross-cut,)

<BR>To cultivate a turn for carpentering, plastering, painting,

<BR>To work as tailor, tailoress, nurse, hostler, porter,

<BR>To invent a little, something ingenious, to aid the washing,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cooking, cleaning,

<BR>And hold it no disgrace to take a hand at them themselves.



<P>&nbsp;I say I bring thee Muse to-day and here,

<BR>All occupations, duties broad and close,

<BR>Toil, healthy toil and sweat, endless, without cessation,

<BR>The old, old practical burdens, interests, joys,

<BR>The family, parentage, childhood, husband and wife,

<BR>The house-comforts, the house itself and all its belongings,

<BR>Food and its preservation, chemistry applied to it,

<BR>Whatever forms the average, strong, complete, sweet-blooded

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man or woman, the perfect longeve personality,

<BR>And helps its present life to health and happiness, and shapes

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its soul,

<BR>For the eternal real life to come.



<P>&nbsp;With latest connections, works, the inter-transportation of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the world,

<BR>Steam-power, the great express lines, gas, petroleum,

<BR>These triumphs of our time, the Atlantic's delicate cable,

<BR>The Pacific railroad, the Suez canal, the Mont Cenis and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gothard and Hoosac tunnels, the Brooklyn bridge,



<P>&nbsp;This earth all spann'd with iron rails, with lines of steamships

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; threading every sea,

<BR>Our own rondure, the current globe I bring.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>8</CENTER>





<P>And thou America,

<BR>Thy offspring towering e'er so high, yet higher Thee above

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all towering,

<BR>With Victory on thy left, and at thy right hand Law;

<BR>Thou Union holding all, fusing, absorbing, tolerating all,

<BR>Thee, ever thee, I sing.



<P>&nbsp;Thou, also thou, a World,

<BR>With all thy wide geographies, manifold, different, distant,

<BR>Rounded by thee in one &amp;emdash; one common orbic language,

<BR>One common indivisible destiny for All.



<P>&nbsp;And by the spells which ye vouchsafe to those your ministers

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in earnest,

<BR>I here personify and call my themes, to make them pass

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before ye.



<P>&nbsp;Behold, America! (and thou, ineffable guest and sister!)

<BR>For thee come trooping up thy waters and thy lands;

<BR>Behold! thy fields and farms, thy far-off woods and mountains,

<BR>As in procession coming.



<P>&nbsp;Behold, the sea itself,

<BR>And on its limitless, heaving breast, the ships;

<BR>See, where their white sails, bellying in the wind, speckle the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; green and blue,

<BR>See, the steamers coming and going, steaming in or out of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; port,

<BR>See, dusky and undulating, the long pennants of smoke.



<P>&nbsp;Behold, in Oregon, far in the north and west,

<BR>Or in Maine, far in the north and east, they cheerful axemen,

<BR>Wielding all day their axes.



<P>&nbsp;Behold, on the lakes, thy pilots at their wheels, thy oarsmen,

<BR>How the ash writhes under those muscular arms!



<P>&nbsp;There by the furnace, and there by the anvil,

<BR>Behold thy sturdy blacksmiths swinging their sledges,

<BR>Overhand so steady, overhand they turn and fall with joyous

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clank,

<BR>Like a tumult of laughter.



<P>&nbsp;Mark the spirit of invention everywhere, thy rapid patents,

<BR>Thy continual workshops, foundries, risen or rising,

<BR>See, from their chimneys how the tall flame-fires stream.



<P>&nbsp;Mark, thy interminable farms, North, South,

<BR>Thy wealthy daughter-states, Eastern and Western,

<BR>The varied products of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Georgia, Texas, and the rest,

<BR>Thy limitless crops, grass, wheat, sugar, oil, corn,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rice, hemp, hops,

<BR>Thy barns all fill'd, the endless freight-train and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bulging storehouse,

<BR>The grapes that ripen on thy vines, the apples in thy

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; orchards,

<BR>Thy incalculable lumber, beef, pork, potatoes, thy coal,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thy gold and silver,

<BR>The inexhaustible iron in thy mines.



<P>&nbsp;All thine, O sacred Union!

<BR>Ships, farms, shops, barns factories, mines,

<BR>City and State, North, South, item and aggregate,

<BR>We dedicate, dread Mother, all to thee!



<P>&nbsp;Protectress absolute, thou! bulwark of all!

<BR>For well we know that while thou givest each and all,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (generous as God,)

<BR>Without thee neither all nor each, nor land, home,

<BR>Nor ship, nor mine, nor any here this day secure,

<BR>Nor aught, nor any day secure.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>9</CENTER>





<P>And thou, the Emblem waving over all!

<BR>Delicate beauty, a word to thee, (it may be salutary,)



<P>&nbsp;Remember thou hast not always been as here to-day so

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comfortably ensovereign'd,

<BR>In other scenes than these have I observ'd thee flag,

<BR>Not quite so trim and whole and freshly blooming in folds

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of stainless silk,

<BR>But I have seen thee bunting, to tatters torn upon thy

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; splinter'd staff,

<BR>Or clutch'd to some young color-bearer's breast with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desperate hands,

<BR>Savagely struggled for, for life or death, fought over long,

<BR>'Mid cannons' thunder-crash and many a curse and groan

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and yell, and rifle-volleys cracking sharp,

<BR>And moving masses as wild demons surging, and lives as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing risk'd,

<BR>For thy mere remnant grimed with dirt and smoke and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sopp'd in blood,

<BR>For sake of that, my beauty, and that thou might'st dally

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as now secure up there,

<BR>Many a good man have I seen go under.



<P>&nbsp;Now here and these and hence in peace, all thine, O flag!

<BR>And here and hence for thee, O universal Muse! and thou for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them!

<BR>And here and hence O Union, all the work and workmen thine!

<BR>None separate from thee &amp;emdash; henceforth One only, we

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and thou,

<BR>(For the blood of the children, what is it, only the blood maternal?

<BR>And lives and works, what are they all at last, except the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; roads to faith and death?)



<P>&nbsp;While we rehearse our measureless wealth, it is for thee, dear

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother,

<BR>We own it all and several to-day indissoluble in thee;

<BR>Think not our chant, our show, merely for products gross or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lucre &amp;emdash; it is for thee, the soul

in thee, electric, spiritual!

<BR>Our farms, inventions, crops, we own in thee! cities and States

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in thee!

<BR>Our freedom all in thee! our very lives in thee!

SONG OF THE UNIVERSAL</H2></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>





<P>C<FONT SIZE=-1>OME</FONT> said the Muse,

<BR>Sing me a song no poet yet has chanted,

<BR>Sing me the universal.



<P>&nbsp;In this broad earth of ours,

<BR>Amid the measureless grossness and the slag,

<BR>Enclosed and safe within its central heart,

<BR>Nestles the seed perfection.



<P>&nbsp;By every life a share or more or less,

<BR>None born but it is born, conceal'd or unconceal'd the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seed is waiting.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>2</CENTER>





<P>Lo! keen-eyed towering science,

<BR>As from tall peaks the modern overlooking,

<BR>Successive absolute fiats issuing.



<P>&nbsp;Yet again, lo! the soul, above all science,

<BR>For it has history gather'd like husks around the globe,

<BR>For it the entire star-myriads roll through the sky.



<P>&nbsp;In spiral routes by long detours,

<BR>(As a much-tacking ship upon the sea,)

<BR>For it the partial to the permanent flowing,

<BR>For it the real to the ideal tends.



<P>&nbsp;For it the mystic evolution,

<BR>Not the right only justified, what we call evil also

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; justified.



<P>&nbsp;Forth from their masks, no matter what,

<BR>From the huge festering trunk, from craft and guile

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and tears,

<BR>Health to emerge and joy, joy universal.



<P>&nbsp;Out of the bulk, the morbid and the shallow,

<BR>Out of the bad majority, the varied countless frauds

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of men and states,

<BR>Electric, antiseptic yet, cleaving, suffusing all,

<BR>Only the good is universal.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>3</CENTER>





<P>Over the mountain-growths disease and sorrow,

<BR>An uncaught bird is ever hovering, hovering,

<BR>High in the purer, happier air.



<P>&nbsp;From imperfection's murkiest cloud,

<BR>Darts always forth one ray of perfect light,

<BR>One flash of heaven's glory.



<P>&nbsp;To fashion's, custom's discord,

<BR>To the mad Babel-din, the deafening orgies,

<BR>Soothing each lull a strain is heard, just heard,

<BR>From some far shore the final chorus sounding.



<P>&nbsp;O the blest eyes, the happy hearts,

<BR>That see, that know the guiding thread so fine,

<BR>Along the mighty labyrinth.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>4</CENTER>





<P>And thou America,

<BR>For the scheme's culmination, its thought and its

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reality,

<BR>For these (not for thyself) thou hast arrived.



<P>&nbsp;Thou too surroundest all,

<BR>Embracing carrying welcoming all, thou too by path-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ways broad and new,

<BR>To the ideal tendest.



<P>&nbsp;The measur'd faiths of other lands, the grandeurs of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the past,

<BR>Are not for thee, but grandeurs of thine own,

<BR>Deific faiths and amplitudes, absorbing, comprehending

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all,

<BR>All eligible to all.



<P>&nbsp;All, all for immortality,

<BR>Love like the light silently wrapping all,

<BR>Nature's amelioration blessing all,

<BR>The blossoms, fruits of ages, orchards divine and certain,

<BR>Forms, objects, growths, humanities, to spiritual images

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ripening.



<P>&nbsp;Give me O God to sing that thought,

<BR>Give me, give him or her I love this quenchless faith

<BR>In Thy ensemble, whatever else withheld withhold not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from us,

<BR>Belief in plan of Thee enclosed in Time and Space,

<BR>Health, peace, salvation universal.



<P>&nbsp;Is it a dream?

<BR>Nay but the lack of it the dream,

<BR>And failing it life's lore and wealth a dream,

<BR>And all the world a dream.

C<FONT SIZE=-1>OME</FONT> my tan-faced children,

Pioneers! O pioneers!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For we cannot tarry here,

<BR>We must march my darlings, we must bear the brunt of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; danger,

<BR>We the youthful sinewy races, all the rest on us depend,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Pioneers! O pioneers!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

O you youths, Western youths,

<BR>So impatient, full of action, full of manly pride and

<BR>Plain I see you Western youths, see you tramping with the

Pioneers! O pioneers!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Have the elder races halted?

<BR>Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied over there

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beyond the seas?



<P>&nbsp;We take up the task eternal, and the burden and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lesson,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

All the past we leave behind,

<BR>Fresh and strong the world we seize, world of labor and

<BR>Down the edges, through the passes, up the mountains steep,

<BR>Conquering, holding, daring, venturing as we go the unknown

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ways,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Pioneers! O pioneers!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We primeval forests felling,

<BR>We the rivers stemming, vexing we and piercing deep the mines

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within,

<BR>We the surface broad surveying, we the virgin soil upheaving,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Colorado men are we,

<BR>From the peaks gigantic, from the great sierras and the high

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plateaus,

<BR>From the mine and from the gully, from the hunting trail we

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come,

<BR>Central inland race are we, from Missouri, with the continental

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blood intervein'd,

<BR>All the hands of comrades clasping, all the Southern, all the

<BR>O beloved race in all! O my breast aches with tender love for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all!

<BR>O I mourn and yet exult, I am rapt with love for all,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<BR>By those swarms upon our rear we must never yield or falter,

<BR>Ages back in ghostly millions frowning there behind us urging,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Pioneers! O pioneers!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

On and on the compact ranks,

<BR>With accessions ever waiting, with the places of the dead

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quickly fill'd,

<BR>Through the battle, through defeat, moving yet and never

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stopping,

O to die advancing on!

<BR>Are there some of us to droop and die? has the hour come?

<BR>Then upon the march we fittest die, soon and sure the gap is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fill'd,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I too with my soul and body,

<BR>We, a curious trio, picking, wandering on our way,

<BR>Through these shores amid the shadows, with the apparitions

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pressing,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Pioneers! O pioneers!

Lo, the darting bowling orb!

<BR>Lo, the brother orbs around, all the clustering suns and

<BR>All the dazzling days, all the mystic nights with dreams,

Pioneers! O pioneers!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These are of us, they are with us,

<BR>All for primal needed work, while the followers there in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; embryo wait behind,

<BR>We to-day's procession heading, we the route for travel

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearing,

Pioneers! O pioneers!

O you daughters of the West!

<BR>Never must you be divided, in our ranks you move united,

Minstrels latent on the prairies!

<BR>(Shrouded bards of other lands, you may rest, you have

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done your work,)

<BR>Soon I hear you coming warbling, soon you rise and tramp

Pioneers! O pioneers!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Not for delectations sweet,

<BR>Not the cushion and the slipper, not the peaceful and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; studious,

<BR>Not the riches safe and palling, not for us the tame

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enjoyment,

Do the feasters gluttonous feast?

Till with sound of trumpet,

<BR>Far, far off the daybreak call&amp;emdash;hark! how loud and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear I hear it wind,

<BR>Swift! to the head of the army!&amp;emdash;swift! spring to

<H2>

TO YOU</H2></CENTER>

W<FONT SIZE=-1>HOEVER</FONT> you are, I fear you are walking the walks

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of dreams,

<BR>I fear these supposed realities are to melt from under your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feet and hands,

<BR>Even now your features, joys, speech, house, trade, manners,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; troubles, follies, costume, crimes, dissipate

away from you,

<BR>Your true soul and body appear before me,

<BR>They stand forth out of affairs, out of commerce, shops, work,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; farms, clothes, the house, buying, selling,

eating, drinking,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffering, dying.



<P>&nbsp;Whoever you are, now I place my hand upon you, that you be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my poem,

<BR>I whisper with my lips close to your ear,

<BR>I have loved many women and men, but I love none better than

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you.



<P>&nbsp;O I have been dilatory and dumb,

<BR>I should have made my way straight to you long ago,



<P>&nbsp;I should have blabb'd nothing but you, I should have chanted

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing but you.



<P>&nbsp;I will leave all and come and make the hymns of you,

<BR>None has understood you, but I understand you,

<BR>None has done justice to you, you have not done justice

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to yourself,

<BR>None but has found you imperfect, I only find no imperfection

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in you,

<BR>None but would subordinate you, I only am he who will never

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consent to subordinate you,

<BR>I only am he who places over you no master, owner, better,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God, beyond what waits intrinsically in yourself.



<P>&nbsp;Painters have painted their swarming groups and the centre-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; figure of all,

<BR>From the head of the centre-figure spreading a nimbus of gold-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; color'd light,

<BR>But I paint myriads of heads, but paint no head without its

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nimbus of gold-color'd light,

<BR>From my hand from the brain of every man and woman it

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; streams, effulgently flowing forever.



<P>&nbsp;O I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you!

<BR>You have not known what you are, you have slumber'd upon

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yourself all your life,

<BR>Your eyelids have been the same as closed most of the time,

<BR>What you have done returns already in mockeries,

<BR>(Your thrift, knowledge, prayers, if they do not return in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mockeries, what is their return?)



<P>&nbsp;The mockeries are not you,

<BR>Underneath them and within them I see you lurk,

<BR>I pursue you where none else has pursued you,

<BR>Silence, the desk, the flippant expression, the night, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accustom'd routine, if these conceal you from

others or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from yourself, they do not conceal you from

me,

<BR>The shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, if

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these balk others they do not balk me,

<BR>The pert apparel, the deform'd attitude, drunkenness, greed,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; premature death, all these I part aside.



<P>&nbsp;There is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you,

<BR>There is no virtue, no beauty in man or woman, but as good is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in you,

<BR>No plunk, no endurance in others, but as good is in you,

<BR>No pleasure waiting for others, but an equal pleasure waits

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for you.



<P>&nbsp;As for me, I give nothing to any one except I give the like

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carefully to you,

<BR>I sing the songs of the glory of none, not God, sooner than

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sing the songs of the glory of you.



<P>&nbsp;Whoever you are! claim your own at any hazard!

<BR>These shows of the East and West are tame compared to you,

<BR>These immense meadows, these interminable rivers, you are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; immense and interminable as they,

<BR>These furies, elements, storms, motions of Nature, throes of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apparent dissolution, you are he or she who

is master or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mistress over them,

<BR>Master or mistress in your own right over Nature, elements,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pain, passion, dissolution.



<P>&nbsp;The hopples fall from your ankles, you find an unfailing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sufficiency,

<BR>Old or young, male or female, rude, low, rejected by the rest,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever you are promulges itself,

<BR>Through birth, life, death, burial, the means are provided,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing is scanted,

<BR>Through angers, losses, ambition, ignorance, ennui, what you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are picks its way.

<CENTER><I>The 18th Year of these States</I></CENTER>





<P>A <FONT SIZE=-1>GREAT</FONT> year and place,

<BR>A harsh discordant natal scream out-sounding, to touch the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother's heart closer than any yet.



<P>&nbsp;I walk'd the shores of my Eastern sea,

<BR>Heard over the waves the little voice,

<BR>Saw the divine infant where she woke mournfully wailing, amid

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the roar of cannon, curses, shouts, crush

of falling buildings,

<BR>Was not so sick from the blood in the gutters running, nor from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the single corpses, nor those in heaps, nor

those borne away

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the tumbrils,

<BR>Was not so desperate at the battues of death&amp;emdash;was not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so shock'd at the repeated fusillades of the

guns.



<P>&nbsp;Pale, silent, stern, what could I say to that long-accrued

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; retribution?

<BR>Could I wish humanity different?

<BR>Could I wish the people made of wood and stone?

<BR>Or that there be no justice in destiny or time?



<P>&nbsp;O liberty! O mate for me!

<BR>Here too the blaze, the grape-shot and the axe, in reserve,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to fetch them out in case of need,

<BR>Here too, though long represt, can never be destroy'd,

<BR>Here too could rise at last murdering and ecstatic,

<BR>Here too demanding full arrears of vengeance.



<P>&nbsp;Hence I sign this salute over the sea,

<BR>And I do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism,

<BR>But remember the little voice that I heard wailing, and wait

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with perfect trust, no matter how long,

<BR>And from to-day sad and cogent I maintain the bequeath'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cause, as for all lands,

<BR>And I send these words to Paris with my love,

<BR>And I guess some chansonniers there will understand them,

<BR>For I guess there is latent music yet in France, floods of it,

<BR>O I hear already the bustle of instruments, they will soon

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be drowning all that would interrupt them,

<BR>O I think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march,

<BR>It reaches hither, it swells me to joyful madness,

<BR>I will run transpose it in words, to justify it,

<BR>I will yet sing a song for you ma femme.

MYSELF AND MINE</H2></CENTER>

M<FONT SIZE=-1>YSELF</FONT> and mine gymnastic ever,

<BR>To stand the cold or heat, to make good aim with a gun, to

children,

<BR>To speak readily and clearly, to feel at home among common

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people,

<BR>And to hold our own in terrible positions on land and sea.



<P>&nbsp;Not for an embroiderer,

<BR>(There will always be plenty of embroiderers, I welcome

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them also,)

<BR>But for the fibre of things and for inherent men and women.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plenteous supreme Gods, that the States may

realize

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agitation and conflict,

<BR>I praise no eminent man, I rebuke to his face the one that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was thought most worthy.



<P>&nbsp;(Who are you? and what are you secretly guilty of all your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life?

<BR>Will you turn aside all your life? will you grub and chatter

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all your life?

<BR>And who are you, blabbing by rote, years, pages, languages,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reminiscences,

<BR>Unwitting to-day that you do not know how to speak properly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a single word?)



<P>&nbsp;Let others finish specimens, I never finish specimens,

<BR>I start them by exhaustless laws as Nature does, fresh and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modern continually.



<P>&nbsp;I give nothing as duties,

<BR>What others give as duties I give as living impulses,

<BR>(Shall I give the heart's action as a duty?)



<P>&nbsp;Let others dispose of questions, I dispose of nothing, I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arouse unanswerable questions,

<BR>Who are they I see and touch, and what about them?

<BR>What about these likes of myself that draw me so close

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by tender directions and indirections?



<P>&nbsp;I call to the world to distrust the accounts of my friends,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but listen to my enemies, as I myself do,

<BR>I charge you forever reject those who would expound

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me, for I cannot expound myself,

<BR>I charge that there be no theory or school founded out

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of me,

<BR>I charge you to leave all free, as I have left all free.



<P>&nbsp;After me, vista!

<BR>O I see life is not short, but immeasurably long,

<BR>I henceforth tread the world chaste, temperate, an early

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; riser, a steady grower,

<BR>Every hour the semen of centuries, and still of centuries.

<BR>I must follow up these continual lessons of the air, water,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth,

<BR>I perceive I have no time to lose.

YEAR OF METEORS</H2></CENTER>



<CENTER>(1859-60)</CENTER>





<P>Y<FONT SIZE=-1>EAR</FONT> of meteors! brooding year!

<BR>I would bind in words retrospective some of your deeds

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and signs,

<BR>I would sing your contest for the 19th Presidentiad,

<BR>I would sing how an old man, tall, with white hair,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mounted the scaffold in Virginia,

<BR>(I was at hand, silent I stood with teeth shut close, I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; watch'd,



<P>&nbsp;I stood very near you old man when cool and indifferent,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but trembling with age and your unheal'd wounds,

you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mounted the scaffold;)

<BR>I would sing in my copious song your census returns of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; States,

<BR>The tables of population and products, I would sing of your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ships and their cargoes,

<BR>The proud black ships of Manhattan arriving, some fill'd with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; immigrants, some from the isthmus with cargoes

of gold,

<BR>Songs thereof would I sing, to all that hitherward comes

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would I welcome give,

<BR>And you would I sing, fair stripling! welcome to you from me,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; young prince of England!

<BR>(Remember you surging Manhattan's crowds as you pass'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with your cortege of nobles?

<BR>There in the crowds stood I, and singled you out with attachment;)

<BR>Nor forget I to sing of the wonder, the ship as she swam up

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my bay,

<BR>Well-shaped and stately the Great Eastern swam up my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bay, she was 600 feet long,

<BR>Her moving swiftly surrounded by myriads of small craft I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forget not to sing;

<BR>Nor the comet that came unannounced out of the north

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flaring in heaven,

<BR>Nor the strange huge meteor-procession dazzling and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear shooting over our heads,

<BR>(A moment, a moment long it sail'd its balls of unearthly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; light over our heads,

<BR>Then departed, dropt in the night, and was gone;)

<BR>Of such, and fitful as they, I sing &amp;emdash; with gleams

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from them would I gleam and patch these chants,

<BR>Your chants, O year all mottled with evil and good

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash; year of forebodings!

<BR>Year of comets and meteors transient and strange

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash; lo! even here one equally transient

and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strange!

<BR>As I flit through you hastily, soon to fall and be gone,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what is this chant,

<BR>What am I myself but one of your meteors?

<P>O but it is not the years &amp;emdash; it is I, it is You,

<BR>The very sun swings itself and its system of planets around

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us,

<BR>Its sun, and its again, all swing around us.

<BR>As for me, (torn, stormy, amid these vehement days,)

<BR>I have the idea of all, and am all and believe in all,



<P>&nbsp;I believe materialism is true and spiritualism is true, I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reject no part.

<BR>(Have I forgotten any part? any thing in the past?

<BR>Come to me whoever and whatever, till I give you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recognition.)

<BR>I respect Assyria, China, Teutonia, and the Hebrews,

<BR>I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god,

<BR>I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without exception,

<BR>I assert that all past days were what they must have been,

<BR>And that they could no-how have been better than they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were,

<BR>And that to-day is what it must be, and that America is,

<BR>And that to-day and America could no-how be better than

<CENTER>WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D</CENTER>



<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>

W<FONT SIZE=-1>hen</FONT> lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd,

<BR>And the great star early droop'd in the western sky in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; night,

<BR>I mourn'd, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.



<P>&nbsp;Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring,

<BR>Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,

<BR>And thought of him I love.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>2</CENTER>

O powerful western fallen star!

<BR>O shades of night&amp;emdash;O moody, tearful night!

<BR>O great star disappear'd&amp;emdash;O the black murk that hides the

star!

<BR>O cruel hands that hold me powerless&amp;emdash;O helpless soul of

me!

<BR>O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>3</CENTER>

In the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; palings,

<BR>Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of rich green,

<BR>With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong I love,

<BR>With every leaf a miracle&amp;emdash;and from this bush in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dooryard,

<BR>With delicate-color'd blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rich green,

<BR>A spring with its flower I break.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>4</CENTER>

In the swamp in secluded recesses,

<BR>A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.



<P>&nbsp;Solitary the thrush,

<BR>The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,

<BR>Sings by himself a song.



<P>&nbsp;Song of the bleeding throat,

<BR>Death's outlet song of life, (for well dear brother I know,

<BR>If thou wast not granted to sing thou would'st surely die.)



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>5</CENTER>

Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,

<BR>Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; peep'd from the ground, spotting the gray

debris,

<BR>Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; endless grass,

<BR>Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the dark-brown fields uprisen,

<BR>Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; orchards,

<BR>Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,

<BR>Night and day journeys a coffin.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>6</CENTER>

Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,

<BR>Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; land,

<BR>With the pomp of the inloop'd flags with the cities draped in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black,

<BR>With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veil'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women standing,

<BR>With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; night,

<BR>With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the unbared heads,

<BR>With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; faces,

<BR>With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rising strong and solemn,

<BR>With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour'd around the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coffin,

<BR>The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs&amp;emdash;where

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amid these you journey,

<BR>With the tolling tolling bells' perpetual clang,

<BR>Here, coffin that slowly passes,

<BR>I give you my sprig of lilac.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>7</CENTER>

(Nor for you, for one alone,

<BR>Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring,

<BR>For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O sane and sacred death.



<P>&nbsp;All over bouquets of roses,

<BR>O death, I cover you over with roses and early lilies,

<BR>But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,

<BR>Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes,

<BR>With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,

<BR>For you and the coffins all of you O death.)



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>8</CENTER>

O western orb sailing the heaven,

<BR>Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walk'd,

<BR>As I walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy night,

<BR>As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after night,

<BR>As you droop'd from the sky low down as if to my side,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (while the other stars all look'd on,)

<BR>As we wander'd together the solemn night, (for something I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know not what kept me from sleep,)

<BR>As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; full you were of woe,

<BR>As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transparent night,

<BR>As I watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black of the night,

<BR>As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; orb,

<BR>Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>9</CENTER>

Sing on there in the swamp,

<BR>O singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call,

<BR>I hear, I come presently, I understand you,

<BR>But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detain'd me,

<BR>The star my departing comrade holds and detains me.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>10</CENTER>

O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?

<BR>And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has gone?

<BR>And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love?



<P>&nbsp;Sea-winds blown from east and west,

<BR>Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; till there on the prairies meeting,

<BR>These and with these and the breath of my chant,

<BR>I'll perfume the grave of him I love.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>11</CENTER>

O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?

<BR>And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,

<BR>To adorn the burial-house of him I love?



<P>&nbsp;Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes,

<BR>With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lucid and bright,

<BR>With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sinking sun, burning, expanding the air,

<BR>With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaves of the trees prolific,

<BR>In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a wind-dapple here and there,

<BR>With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and shadows,

<BR>And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chimneys,

<BR>And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; homeward returning.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>12</CENTER>

Lo, body and soul&amp;emdash;this land,

<BR>My own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hurrying tides, and the ships,

<BR>The varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ohio's shores and flashing Missouri,

<BR>And ever the far-spreading prairies cover'd with grass and corn.



<P>&nbsp;Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty,

<BR>The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes,

<BR>The gentle soft-born measureless light,

<BR>The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill'd noon,

<BR>The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars,

<BR>Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>13</CENTER>

Sing on, sing on you gray-brown bird,

<BR>Sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bushes,

<BR>Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.



<P>&nbsp;Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song,

<BR>Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.



<P>&nbsp;O liquid and free and tender!

<BR>O wild and loose to my soul&amp;emdash;O wondrous singer!

<BR>You only I hear&amp;emdash;yet the star holds me, (but will soon

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; depart,)

<BR>Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>14</CENTER>

Now while I sat in the day and look'd forth,

<BR>In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the farmers preparing their crops,

<BR>In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and forests,

<BR>In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb'd winds and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the storms,)

<BR>Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the voices of children and women,

<BR>The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail'd,

<BR>And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; busy with labor,

<BR>And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with its meals and minutia of daily usages,

<BR>And the streets how their throbbings throbb'd, and the cities

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pent&amp;emdash;lo, then and there,

<BR>Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the rest,

<BR>Appear'd the cloud, appear'd the long black trail,

<BR>And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; death.



<P>&nbsp;Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,

<BR>And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,

<BR>And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hands of companions,

<BR>I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,

<BR>Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the dimness,

<BR>To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.



<P>&nbsp;And the singer so shy to the rest receiv'd me,

<BR>The gray-brown bird I know receiv'd us comrades three,

<BR>And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.



<P>&nbsp;From deep secluded recesses,

<BR>From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,

<BR>Came the carol of the bird.



<P>&nbsp;And the charm of the carol rapt me,

<BR>As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,

<BR>And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Come lovely and soothing death</I>,

<BR><I>Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,</I>

<BR><I>In the day, in the night, to all, to each</I>,

<BR><I>Sooner or later delicate death</I>



<P>&nbsp;<I>Prais'd be the fathomless universe</I>,

<BR><I>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious</I>,

<BR><I>And for love, sweet love&amp;emdash;but praise! praise! praise</I>!

<BR><I>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet</I>,

<BR><I>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome</I>?

<BR><I>Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all</I>,

<BR><I>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unfalteringly</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Approach strong deliveress</I>,

<BR><I>When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dead</I>,

<BR><I>Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee</I>,

<BR><I>Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>From me to thee glad serenades</I>,

<BR><I>Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feastings for thee</I>,

<BR><I>And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are fitting</I>,

<BR><I>And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>The night in silence under many a star</I>,

<BR><I>The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know</I>,

<BR><I>And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil'd death</I>,

<BR><I>And the body gratefully nestling close to thee</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Over the tree-tops I float thee a song</I>,

<BR><I>Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the

prairies wide</I>,

<BR><I>Over the dense-pack'd cities all and the teeming wharves and</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ways</I>,

<BR><I>I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death</I>.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>15</CENTER>

To the tally of my soul,

<BR>Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,

<BR>With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.

<BR>Loud in the pines and cedars dim,

<BR>Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,

<BR>And I with my comrades there in the night.



<P>&nbsp;While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,

<BR>As to long panoramas of visions.



<P>&nbsp;And I saw askant the armies,

<BR>I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,

<BR>Borne through the smoke of the battles and pier'd with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; missiles I saw them,

<BR>And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bloody,

<BR>And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silence,)

<BR>And the staffs all splinter'd and broken.



<P>&nbsp;I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,

<BR>And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,

<BR>I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,

<BR>But I saw they were not as was thought,

<BR>They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not,

<BR>The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd,

<BR>And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd,

<BR>And the armies that remain'd suffer'd.

Passing the visions, passing the night,

<BR>Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands,

<BR>Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my soul,

<BR>Victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying ever-altering

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; song,

<BR>As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flooding the night,

<BR>Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again bursting with joy,

<BR>Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,

<BR>As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,



<P>&nbsp;Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,

<BR>I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spring.



<P>&nbsp;I cease from my song for thee,

<BR>From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; communing with thee,

<BR>O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.



<P>&nbsp;Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,

<BR>The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,

<BR>And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,

<BR>With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; full of woe,

<BR>With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,

<BR>Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the dead I loved so well,

<BR>For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands&amp;emdash;and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this for his dear sake,

<BR>Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,

<BR>There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.

O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN!</H2></CENTER>

O C<FONT SIZE=-1>aptain</FONT>! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,

<BR>The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,

<BR>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,

<BR>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;



<P>&nbsp;But O heart! heart! heart!

<BR>O the bleeding drops of red,

<BR>Where on the deck my Captain lies,

<BR>Fallen cold and dead.



<P>&nbsp;O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;

<BR>Rise up&amp;emdash;for you the flag is flung&amp;emdash;for you the

bugle trills,

<BR>For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths&amp;emdash;for you the shores

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a-crowding,

<BR>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turning;

<BR>Here Captain! dear father!

<BR>The arm beneath your head!

<BR>It is some dream that on the deck,

<BR>You've fallen cold and dead.



<P>&nbsp;My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,

<BR>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,

<BR>The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done,

<BR>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won:

<BR>Exult O shores, and ring O bells!

<BR>But I with mournful tread,

<BR>Walk the deck my Captain lies,

<BR>Fallen cold and dead.

<P>&nbsp;No more for him life's stormy conflicts,

<P>&nbsp;But sing poet in our name,

<BR>Sing of the love we bore him&amp;emdash;because you&amp;emdash;dweller

in camps,

<I>A Song for Occupations</I></H1></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>





<P>A <FONT SIZE=-1>SONG</FONT> for occupations!

<BR>In the labor of engines and trades and the labor of fields

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find the developments,

<BR>And find the eternal meanings.



<P>&nbsp;Workmen and Workwomen!

<BR>Were all educations practical and ornamental well display'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out of me, what would it amount to?

<BR>Were I as the head teacher, charitable proprietor, wise

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statesman, what would it amount to?

<BR>Were I to you as the boss employing and paying you, would

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that satisfy you?



<P>&nbsp;The learn'd, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual terms,

<BR>A man like me and never the usual terms.



<P>&nbsp;Neither a servant nor a master I,

<BR>I take no sooner a large price than a small price, I will

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have my own whoever enjoys me,

<BR>I will be even with you and you shall be even with me.



<P>&nbsp;If you stand at work in a shop I stand as nigh as the nighest

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the same shop,

<BR>If you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; demand as good as your brother or dearest

friend,

<BR>If your lover, husband, wife, is welcome by day or night, I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; must be personally as welcome,

<BR>If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become so for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your sake,

<BR>If you remember your foolish and outlaw'd deeds, do you think

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot remember my own foolish and outlaw'd

deeds?

<BR>If you carouse at the table I carouse at the opposite side of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the table,

<BR>If you meet some stranger in the streets and love him or her,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why I often meet strangers in the street and

love them.



<P>&nbsp;Why what have you thought of yourself?

<BR>Is it you then that thought yourself less?

<BR>Is it you that thought the President greater than you?

<BR>Or the rich better off than you? or the educated wiser than

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you?



<P>&nbsp;(Because you are greasy or pimpled, or were once drunk,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a thief,

<BR>Or that you are diseas'd, or rheumatic, or a prostitute,

<BR>Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no scholar

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and never saw your name in print,

<BR>Do you give in that you are any less immortal?)



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>2</CENTER>





<P>Souls of men and women! it is not you I call unseen, unheard,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untouchable and untouching,

<BR>It is not you I go argue pro and con about, and to settle

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether you are alive or no,

<BR>I own publicly who you are, if nobody else owns.



<P>&nbsp;Grown, half-grown and babe, of this country and every

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; country, indoors and out-doors, one just as

much as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the other, I see,

<BR>And all else behind or through them.



<P>&nbsp;The wife, and she is not one jot less than the husband,

<BR>The daughter, and she is just as good as the son,

<BR>The mother, and she is every bit as much as the father.



<P>&nbsp;Offspring of ignorant and poor, boys apprenticed to trades,

<BR>Young fellows working on farms and old fellows working on

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; farms,

<BR>Sailor-men, merchant-men, coasters, immigrants,

<BR>All these I see, but nigher and farther the same I see,

<BR>None shall escape me and none shall wish to escape me.



<P>&nbsp;I bring what you much need yet always have,

<BR>Not money, amours, dress, eating, erudition, but as good,

<BR>I send no agent or medium, offer no representative of value,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but offer the value itself.



<P>&nbsp;There is something that comes to one now and perpetually,

<BR>It is not what is printed, preach'd, discussed, it eludes

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discussion and print,

<BR>It is not to be put in a book, it is not in this book,

<BR>It is for you whoever you are, it is no farther from you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than your hearing and sight are from you,

<BR>It is hinted by nearest, commonest, readiest, it is ever

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provoked by them.



<P>&nbsp;You may read in many languages, yet read nothing about it,

<BR>You may read the President's message and read nothing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about it there,

<BR>Nothing in the reports from the State department or Treasury

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; department, or in the daily papers or weekly

papers,

<BR>Or in the census or revenue returns, prices current, or any

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accounts of stock.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>3</CENTER>





<P>The sun and stars that float in the open air,

<BR>The apple-shaped earth and we upon it, surely the drift of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them is something grand,



<P>&nbsp;I do not know what it is except that it is grand, and that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is happiness,

<BR>And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or bon-mot or reconnoissance,

<BR>And that it is not something which by luck may turn out well

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for us, and without luck must be a failure

for us,

<BR>And not something which may yet be retracted in a certain

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contingency.



<P>&nbsp;The light and shade, the curious sense of body and identity, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; greed that with perfect complaisance devours

all things,

<BR>The endless pride and outstretching of man, unspeakable joys

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sorrows,

<BR>The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees, and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wonders that fill each minute of time forever,

<BR>What have you reckon'd them for, camerado?

<BR>Have you reckon'd them for your trade or farm-work? or for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the profits of your store?

<BR>Or to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a gentleman's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leisure, or a lady's leisure?



<P>&nbsp;Have you reckon'd that the landscape took substance and form

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that it might be painted in a picture?

<BR>Or men and women that they might be written of, and songs

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sung?

<BR>Or the attraction of gravity, and the great laws and harmonious

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; combinations and the fluids of the air, as

subjects for the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; savans?

<BR>Or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and charts?

<BR>Or the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names?

<BR>Or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables, or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agriculture itself?



<P>&nbsp;Old institutions, these arts, libraries, legends, collections,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the practice handed along in manufactures,

will we rate

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them so high?

<BR>Will we rate our cash and business high? I have no objection,

<BR>I rate them as high as the highest &amp;emdash; then a child born

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a woman and man I rate beyond all rate.



<P>&nbsp;We thought our Union grand, and our Constitution grand,

<BR>I do not say they are not grand and good, for they are,

<BR>I am this day just as much in love with them as you,

<BR>Then I am in love with You, and with all my fellows upon

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the earth.



<P>&nbsp;We consider bibles and religions divine &amp;emdash; I do not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say they are not divine,

<BR>I say they have all grown out of you, and may grow out of you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; still,

<BR>It is not they who give the life, it is you who give the life,

<BR>Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from the earth,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than they are shed out of you.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>4</CENTER>





<P>The sum of all known reverence I add up in you whoever you are,

<BR>The President is there in the White House for you, it is not you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who are here for him,

<BR>The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you, not you here for them,

<BR>The Congress convenes every Twelfth-month for you,

<BR>Laws, courts, the forming of States, the charters of cities, the going

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and coming of commerce and mails, are all

for you.



<P>&nbsp;List close my scholars dear,

<BR>Doctrines, politics and civilization exurge from you,

<BR>Sculpture and monuments and any thing inscribed anywhere are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tallied in you,

<BR>The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reach is in you this hour, and myths and tales

the same,

<BR>If you were not breathing and walking here, where would they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all be?

<BR>The most renown'd poems would be ashes, orations and plays

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would be vacuums.



<P>&nbsp;All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it,

<BR>(Did you think it was in the white or gray stone? or the lines

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the arches and cornices?)



<P>&nbsp;All music is what awakes from you when you are reminded

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the instruments,

<BR>It is not the violins and the cornets, it is not the oboe nor

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the beating drums, nor the score of the baritone

singer

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; singing his sweet romanza, nor that of the

men's chorus,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor that of the women's chorus,

<BR>It is nearer and farther than they.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>5</CENTER>





<P>Will the whole come back then?

<BR>Can each see signs of the best by a look in the looking-glass?

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is there nothing greater or more?

<BR>Does all sit there with you, with the mystic unseen soul?



<P>&nbsp;Strange and hard that paradox true I give,

<BR>Objects gross and the unseen soul are one.



<P>&nbsp;House-building, measuring, sawing the boards,

<BR>Blacksmithing, glass-blowing, nail-making, coopering,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tin-roofing, shingle-dressing,

<BR>Ship-joining, dock-building, fish-curing, flagging of sidewalks

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by flaggers,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echoes, songs, what meditations, what vast

native thoughts

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; looking through smutch'd faces,

<BR>Iron-works, forge-fires in the mountains or by river-banks, men

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; around feeling the melt with huge crowbars,

lumps of ore,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the due combining of ore, limestone, coal,

<BR>The blast-furnace and the puddling-furnace, the loup-lump at the

the jib to protect

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the thumb,

<BR>The calking-iron, the kettle of boiling vault-cement, and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire under the kettle,



<P>&nbsp;The cotton-bale, the stevedore's hook, the saw and buck of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sawyer, the mould of the moulder, the working-knife

of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; butcher, the ice-saw, and all the work with

ice,

<BR>The work and tools of the rigger, grappler, sail-maker, block-

<BR>The awl and knee-strap, the pint measure and quart measure,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the counter and stool, the writing-pen of

quill or metal, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making of all sorts of edged tools,

<BR>The brewery, brewing, the malt, the vats, everything that is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done by brewers, wine-makers, vinegar-makers,

<BR>Leather-dressing, coach-making, boiler-making, rope-twisting,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distilling, sign-painting, lime-burning, cotton-picking,

electro-

wagons,

<BR>The cart of the carman, the omnibus, the ponderous dray,

<BR>Pyrotechny, letting off color'd fireworks at night, fancy figures

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and jets;

<BR>Beef on the butcher's stall, the slaughter-house of the butcher,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the butcher in his killing-clothes,

<BR>The pens of live pork, the killing-hammer, the hog-hook, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scalder's tub, gutting, the cutter's cleaver,

the packer's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maul, and the plenteous winterwork of pork-packing,

<BR>Flour-works, grinding of wheat, rye, maize, rice, the barrels

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the half and quarter barrels, the loaded

barges, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high piles on wharves and levees,

<BR>The men and the work of the men on ferries, railroad,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coasters, fish-boats, canals;

<BR>The hourly routine of your own or any man's life, the shop,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yard, store, or factory,

<BR>These shows all near you by day and night&amp;emdash;workman!

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whoever you are, your daily life!

<BR>In that and them the heft of the heaviest&amp;emdash;in that and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them far more than you estimated, (and far

less also,)

<BR>In them realities for you and me, in them poems for you and me,



<P>&nbsp;In them, not yourself&amp;emdash;you and your soul enclose all

things,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of estimation,

<BR>In them the development good&amp;emdash;in them all themes, hints,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possibilities.

<BR>I do not affirm that what you see beyond is futile, I do not advise

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you to stop,

<BR>I do not say leadings you thought great are not great,

<BR>But I say that none lead to greater than these lead to.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>6</CENTER>





<P>Will you seek afar off? you surely come back at last,

<BR>In things best known to you finding the best, or as good as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the best,

<BR>In folks nearest to you finding the sweetest, strongest,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lovingest,

<BR>Happiness, knowledge, not in another place but this place,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not for another hour but this hour,

<BR>Man in the first you see or touch, always in friend, brother,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nighest neighbor&amp;emdash;woman in mother,

sister, wife,

<BR>The popular tastes and employments taking precedence in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poems or anywhere,

<BR>You workwomen and workmen of these States having your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own divine and strong life,

<BR>And all else giving place to men and women like you.



<P>&nbsp;When the psalm sings instead of the singer,

<BR>When the script preaches instead of the preacher,

<BR>When the pulpit descends and goes instead of the carver that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carved the supporting desk,

<BR>When I can touch the body of books by night or by day, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when they touch my body back again,

<BR>When a university course convinces like a slumbering woman

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and child convince,

<BR>When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the night-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; watchman's daughter,

<BR>When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite and are my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; friendly companions,

<BR>I intend to reach them my hand, and make as much of them as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do of men and women like you.

<CENTER>1</CENTER>





<P>A<FONT SIZE=-1>FOOT</FONT> and light-hearted I take to the open road,

<BR>Healthy, free, the world before me,

<BR>The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.



<P>&nbsp;Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune,

<BR>Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing,

<BR>Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,

<BR>Strong and content I travel the open road.



<P>&nbsp;The earth, that is sufficient,

<BR>I do not want the constellations any nearer,

<BR>I know they are very well where they are,

<BR>I know they suffice for those who belong to them.



<P>&nbsp;(Still here I carry my old delicious burdens,

<BR>I carry them, men and women, I carry them with me

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wherever I go,



<P>&nbsp;I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them,

<BR>I am fill'd with them; and I will fill them in return.)



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>2</CENTER>





<P>You road I enter upon and look around, I believe you are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not all that is here,

<BR>I believe that much unseen is also here.



<P>&nbsp;Here the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; denial,

<BR>The black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas'd, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; illiterate person, are not denied;

<BR>The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar's tramp,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the drunkard's stagger, the laughing party

of mechanics,

<BR>The escaped youth, the rich person's carriage, the fop, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eloping couple,

<BR>The early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into the town, the return back from the town,

<BR>They pass, I also pass, any thing passes, none can be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interdicted,

<BR>None but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me.

<P>You air that serves me with breath to speak!

<BR>You objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them shape!

<BR>You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; showers!

<BR>You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides!

<BR>I believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dear to me.



<P>&nbsp;You flagg'd walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges!

<BR>You ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timberlined

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sides! you distant ships!

<BR>You rows of houses! you window-pierc'd fa&ccedil;ades! you roofs!

<BR>You porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!

<BR>You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!



<P>&nbsp;You doors and ascending steps! you arches!

<BR>You gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crossings!

<BR>From all that has touch'd you I believe you have imparted to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yourselves, and now would impart the same

secretly to me,

<BR>From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surfaces, and the spirits thereof would be

evident and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amicable with me.



<P>&nbsp;

<P>The earth expanding right hand and left hand,

<BR>The picture alive, every part in its best light,

<BR>The music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is not wanted,

<BR>The cheerful voice of the public road, the gay fresh sentiment

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the road.



<P>&nbsp;O highway I travel, do you say to me <I>Do not leave me?</I>

<BR>Do you say <I>Venture not&amp;emdash;if you leave me you are lost?</I>

<BR>Do you say <I>I am already prepared, I am well-beaten and</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; undenied, adhere to me?</I>



<P>&nbsp;O public road, I say back I am not afraid to leave you, yet I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love you,

<BR>You express me better than I can express myself,

<BR>You shall be more to me than my poem.



<P>&nbsp;I think heroic deeds were all conceiv'd in the open air, and all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free poems also,

<BR>I think I could stop here myself and do miracles,

<BR>I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whoever beholds me shall like me,

<BR>I think whoever I see must be happy.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>5</CENTER>





<P>From this hour I ordain myself loos'd of limits and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imaginary lines,

<BR>Going where I list, my own master total and absolute,

<BR>Listening to others, considering well what they say,



<P>&nbsp;Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,

<BR>Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; holds that would hold me.



<P>&nbsp;I inhale great draughts of space,

<BR>The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are mine.



<P>&nbsp;I am larger, better than I thought,

<BR>I did not know I held so much goodness.



<P>&nbsp;All seems beautiful to me,

<BR>I can repeat over to men and women You have done such

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good to me I would do the same to you,

<BR>I will recruit for myself and you as I go,

<BR>I will scatter myself among men and women as I go,

<BR>I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them,

<BR>Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me,

<BR>Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>6</CENTER>





<P>Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amaze me,

<BR>Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear'd it

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would not astonish me.



<P>&nbsp;Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons,

<BR>It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth.



<P>&nbsp;Here a great personal deed has room,

<BR>(Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men,

<BR>Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all authority and all argument against it.)



<P>&nbsp;Here is the test of wisdom,

<BR>Wisdom is not finally tested in schools,

<BR>Wisdom cannot be pass'd from one having it to another not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having it,



<P>&nbsp;Wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proof,

<BR>Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content,

<BR>Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the excellence of things;

<BR>Something there is in the float of the sight of things that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provokes it out of the soul.



<P>&nbsp;Now I re-examine philosophies and religions,

<BR>They may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under the spacious clouds and along the landscape

and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flowing currents.



<P>&nbsp;Here is realization,

<BR>Here is a man tallied&amp;emdash;he realizes here what he has in him,

<BR>The past, the future, majesty, love&amp;emdash;if they are vacant of

you,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you are vacant of them.



<P>&nbsp;Only the kernel of every object nourishes;

<BR>Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me?

<BR>Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and me?



<P>&nbsp;Here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion'd, it is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apropos;

<BR>Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?

<BR>Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>7</CENTER>





<P>Here is the efflux of the soul,

<BR>The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gates, ever provoking questions,

<BR>These yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why are they?

<BR>Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sunlight expands my blood?

<BR>Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lank?

<BR>Why are there trees I never walk under but large and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; melodious thoughts descend upon me?



<P>&nbsp;(I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and always drop fruit as I pass;)

<BR>What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?

<BR>What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?

<BR>What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walk by and pause?

<BR>What gives me to be free to a woman's and man's good-will?

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what gives them to be free to mine?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>8</CENTER>





<P>The efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness,

<BR>I think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times,

<BR>Now it flows unto us, we are rightly charged.



<P>&nbsp;Here rises the fluid and attaching character,

<BR>The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweetness of man and woman,

<BR>(The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every day out of the roots of themselves,

than it sprouts

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fresh and sweet continually out of itself.)

<BR>Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the love of young and old,

<BR>From it falls distill'd the charm that mocks beauty and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attainments,

<BR>Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.

<P>Allons! whoever you are come travel with me!

<BR>Travelling with me you find what never tires.



<P>&nbsp;The earth never tires,

<BR>The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first, Nature is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rude and incomprehensible at first,

<BR>Be not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; envelop'd,

<BR>I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; words can tell.



<P>&nbsp;Allons! we must not stop here,

<BR>However sweet these laid-up stores, however convenient this

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dwelling we cannot remain here,

<BR>However shelter'd this port and however calm these waters

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we must not anchor here,

<BR>However welcome the hospitality that surrounds us we are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permitted to receive it but a little while.

<P>Allons! the inducements shall be greater,

<BR>We will sail pathless and wild seas,

<BR>We will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the Yankee

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clipper speeds by under full sail.



<P>&nbsp;Allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements,

<BR>Health, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity;

<BR>Allons! from all formules!

<BR>From your formules, O bat-eyed and materialistic priests.



<P>&nbsp;The stale cadaver blocks up the passage&amp;emdash;the burial

waits no

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longer.



<P>&nbsp;Allons! yet take warning!

<BR>He traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance,

<BR>None may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; health,

<BR>Come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself,

<BR>Only those may come who come in sweet and determin'd bodies,

<BR>No diseas'd person, no rum-drinker or venereal taint is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permitted here.



<P>&nbsp;(I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes,

<BR>We convince by our presence.)



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>11</CENTER>





<P>Listen! I will be honest with you,

<BR>I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes,

<BR>These are the days that must happen to you:



<P>&nbsp;You shall not heap up what is call'd riches,

<BR>You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve,

<BR>You but arrive at the city to which you were destin'd, you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hardly settle yourself to satisfaction before

you are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call'd by an irresistible call to depart,

<BR>You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those who remain behind you,

<BR>What beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with passionate kisses of parting,

<BR>You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reach'd hands toward you.

<P>Allons! after the great Companions, and to belong to them!

<BR>They too are on the road&amp;emdash;they are the swift and majestic

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men&amp;emdash;they are the greatest women,

<BR>Enjoyers of calms of seas and storms of seas,

<BR>Sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land,

<BR>Habitu&egrave;s of many distant countries, habitu&egrave;s of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; far-distant dwellings,

<BR>Trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toilers,

<BR>Pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shore,

<BR>Dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; children, bearers of children,

<BR>Soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers-down

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of coffins,

<BR>Journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; curious years each emerging from that which

proceded it,

<BR>Journeyers as with companions, namely their own diverse

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phases,

<BR>Forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days,

<BR>Journeyers gayly with their own youth, journeyers with their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bearded and well-grain'd manhood,

<BR>Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass'd,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content,

<BR>Journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; womanhood,



<P>&nbsp;Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the universe,

<BR>Old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; death.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>13</CENTER>





<P>Allons! to that which is endless as it was beginningless,

<BR>To undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights,

<BR>To merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nights they tend to,

<BR>Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys,

<BR>To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it,

<BR>To conceive no time, however distant, but what you may

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reach it and pass it,

<BR>To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you, however long but it stretches and waits

for you,

<BR>To see no being, not God's or any, but you also go thither,

<BR>To see no possession but you may possess it, enjoying all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without labor or purchase, abstracting the

feast yet not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abstracting one particle of it,

<BR>To take the best of the farmer's farm and the rich man's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elegant villa, and the chaste blessings of

the well-married

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; couple, and the fruits of orchards and flowers

of gardens,

<BR>To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through,

<BR>To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go,

<BR>To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encounter them, to gather the love out of

their hearts,

<BR>To take your lovers on the road with you, for all that you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leave them behind you,

<BR>To know the universe itself as a road, as many roads, as roads

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for traveling souls.



<P>&nbsp;All parts away for the progress of souls,

<BR>All religion, all solid things, arts, governments&amp;emdash;all that

was

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or is apparent upon this globe or any globe,

falls into

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; niches and corners before the procession of

souls along

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the grand roads of the universe.



<P>&nbsp;Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grand roads of the universe, all other progress

is the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; needed emblem and sustenance.



<P>&nbsp;Forever alive, forever forward,

<BR>Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feeble, dissatisfied,

<BR>Desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected by

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men,

<BR>They go! they go! I know that they go, but I know not where

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they go,

<BR>But I know that they go toward the best&amp;emdash;toward

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something great.



<P>&nbsp;Whoever you are, come forth! or man or woman come forth!

<BR>You must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; though you built it, or though it has been

built for you.



<P>&nbsp;Out of the dark confinement! out from behind the screen!

<BR>It is useless to protest, I know all and expose it.



<P>&nbsp;Behold through you as bad as the rest,

<BR>Through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people,

<BR>Inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash'd and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trimm'd faces,

<BR>Behold a secret silent loathing and despair.



<P>&nbsp;No husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession,

<BR>Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it goes,

<BR>Formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, polite

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bland in the parlors,

<BR>In the cars of railroads, in steamboats, in the public assembly,

<BR>Home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bedroom, everywhere,

<BR>Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under the breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones,

<BR>Under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; artificial flowers,



<P>&nbsp;Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself,

<BR>Speaking of any thing else but never of itself.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>14</CENTER>





<P>Allons! through struggles and wars!

<BR>The goal that was named cannot be countermanded.



<P>&nbsp;Have the past struggles succeeded?

<BR>What has succeeded? yourself? your nation? Nature?

<BR>Now understand me well&amp;emdash;it is provided in the essence of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things that from any fruition of success,

no matter what,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall come forth something to make a greater

struggle

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary.



<P>&nbsp;My call is the call of battle, I nourish active rebellion,

<BR>He going with me must go well arm'd,

<BR>He going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, angry

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enemies, desertions.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>15</CENTER>





<P>Allons! the road is before us!

<BR>It is safe&amp;emdash;I have tried it&amp;emdash;my own feet have tried

it well&amp;emdash;be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not detain'd!

<BR>Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the shelf unopen'd!



<P>&nbsp;Let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unearn'd!

<BR>Let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher!

<BR>Let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the court, and the judge expound the law.



<P>&nbsp;Camerado, I give you my hand!

<BR>I give you my love more precise than money,

<BR>I give you myself before preaching or law;

<BR>Will you give me yourself? will you come travel with me?

<BR>Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?

<CENTER>A BOSTON BALLAD</CENTER>



<CENTER>(1854)</CENTER>



<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>



<CENTER></CENTER>

To get betimes in Boston town I rose this morning early,

<BR>Here's a good place at the corner, I must stand and see the show.



<P>&nbsp;Clear the way there Jonathan!

<BR>Way for the President's marshal&amp;emdash;way for the government cannon!

<BR>Way for the Federal foot and dragoons, (and the apparitions copiously

tumbling.)



<P>&nbsp;I love to look on the Stars and Stripes, I hope the fifes will

play Yankee Doodle.



<P>&nbsp;How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!

<BR>Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.



<P>&nbsp;A fog follows, antiques of the same come limping,

<BR>Some appear wooden-legged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless.



<P>&nbsp;Why this is indeed a show&amp;emdash;it has called the dead out

of the earth!

<BR>The old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see!

<BR>Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear!

<BR>Cock'd hats of mothy mould&amp;emdash;crutches made of mist!

<BR>Arms in slings&amp;emdash;old men leaning on young men's shoulders.



<P>&nbsp;What troubles you Yankee phantoms? what is all this chattering

of bare gums?



<P>&nbsp;Does the ague convulse your limbs? do you mistake your crutches

for firelocks and level them?



<P>&nbsp;If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the President's

marshal,

<BR>If you groan such groans you might balk the government cannon.



<P>&nbsp;For shame old maniacs&amp;emdash;bring down those toss'd arms,

and let your white hair be,

<BR>Here gape your great-grandsons, their wives gaze at them from the windows,

<BR>See how well dress'd, see how orderly they conduct themselves.



<P>&nbsp;Worse and worse&amp;emdash;can't you stand it? are you retreating?

<BR>Is this hour with the living too dead for you?



<P>&nbsp;Retreat then&amp;emdash;pell-mell!

<BR>To your graves&amp;emdash;back&amp;emdash;back to the hills old limpers!

<BR>I do not think you belong here anyhow.



<P>&nbsp;But there is one thing that belongs here&amp;emdash;shall I tell

you what it is, gentlemen of Boston?



<P>&nbsp;I will whisper it to the Mayor, he shall send a committee to England,

<BR>They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a cart to the royal

vault,

<BR>Dig out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the grave-clothes,

box up his bones for a journey,

<BR>Find a swift Yankee clipper&amp;emdash;here is freight for you, blackbellied

clipper,

<BR>Up with your anchor&amp;emdash;shake out your sails&amp;emdash;steer

straight toward Boston bay.



<P>&nbsp;Now call for the President's marshal again, bring out the government

cannon,

<BR>Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make another procession, guard

it with foot and dragoons.



<P>&nbsp;This centre-piece for them;

<BR>Look, all orderly citizens&amp;emdash;look from the windows, women!



<P>&nbsp;The committee open the box, set up the regal ribs, glue those

that will not stay,

<BR>Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the skull.



<P>&nbsp;You have got your revenge, old buster&amp;emdash;the crown is

come to its own, and more than its own.



<P>&nbsp;Stick your hands in your pockets, Jonathan&amp;emdash;you are

a made man from this day,

<BR>You are mighty cute&amp;emdash;and here is one of your bargains.

<PRE>(1854?)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1871</PRE>



<CENTER>EUROPE</CENTER>



<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>The 72d and 73d Years of These States</I></CENTER>

S<c>uddenly</c> out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,

<BR>Like lightning it le'pt forth half startled at itself,

<BR>Its feet upon the ashes and the rags, its hand tight to the throats

of kings.



<P>&nbsp;O hope and faith!

<BR>O aching close of exiled patriots' lives!

<BR>O many a sicken'd heart!

<BR>Turn back unto this day and make yourselves afresh.



<P>&nbsp;And you, paid to defile the People&amp;emdash;you liars, mark!

<BR>Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,

<BR>For court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his simplicity

the poor man's wages,

<BR>For many a promise sworn by royal lips and broken and laugh'd at in

the breaking,

<BR>Then in their power not for all these did the blows strike revenge,

or the heads of the nobles fall;

<BR>The People scorn'd the ferocity of kings.



<P>&nbsp;But the sweetness of mercy brew'd bitter destruction, and the

frighten'd monarchs come back,

<BR>Each comes in state with his train, hangman, priest, taxgatherer,

<BR>Soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant.



<P>&nbsp;Yet behind all lowering stealing, lo, a shape,

<BR>Vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front and form, in scarlet

folds,

<BR>Whose face and eyes none may see,

<BR>Out of its robes only this, the red robes lifted by the arm,

<BR>One finger crook'd pointed high over the top, like the head of a snake

appears.



<P>&nbsp;Meanwhile corpses lie in new-made graves, bloody corpses of young

men,

<BR>The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are flying,

the creatures of power laugh aloud,

<BR>And all these things bear fruits, and they are good.



<P>&nbsp;Those corpses of young men,

<BR>Ride to-day through Manhattan.

<BR>Libertad! I do not know whether others behold what I behold,

haze,

<BR>When gorgeous the countless straight stems, the forests at

<BR>When every ship richly drest carries her flag at the peak,

<BR>When pennants trail and street-festoons hang from the

<BR>When Broadway is entirely given up to foot-passengers and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foot-standers, when the mass is densest,

<BR>To-day our Antipodes comes.

<BR>The Originatress comes,

<BR>The nest of languages, the bequeather of poems, the race of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eld,

<BR>Florid with blood, pensive, rapt with musings, hot with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passion,

<BR>Sultry with perfume, with ample and flowing garments,

<BR>With sunburnt visage, with intense soul and glittering eyes,

<BR>The race of Brahma comes.

<BR>See my cantabile! these and more are flashing to us from the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; procession,

<BR>As it moves changing, a kaleidoscope divine it moves changing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before us.

<BR>For not the envoys nor the tann'd Japanee from his island

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only,

<BR>Lithe and silent the Hindoo appears, the Asiatic continent

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself appears, the past, the dead,

<BR>The murky night-morning of wonder and fable inscrutable,

<BR>The envelop'd mysteries, the old and unknown hive-bees,

<BR>The north, the sweltering south, eastern Assyria, the Hebrews,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ancient of ancients,

<BR>Vast desolated cities, the gliding present, all of these and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more are in the pageant-procession.

<BR>Geography, the world, is in it,

<BR>The Great Sea, the brood of islands, Polynesia, the coast

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beyond,

<BR>The coast you henceforth are facing &amp;emdash; you, Libertad! from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your Western golden shores,

<BR>The countries there with their populations, the millions enmasse

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are curiously here,

<BR>The swarming market-places, the temples with idols ranged

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along the sides or at the end, bonze, brahmin,

and llama,

<BR>Mandarin, farmer, merchant, mechanic, and fisherman,

<BR>The singing-girl and the dancing-girl, the ecstatic persons,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the secluded emperors,

<BR>Confucius himself, the great poets and heroes, the warriors,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the castes, all,

<BR>Trooping up, crowding from all directions, from the Altay

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mountains,

<BR>From Thibet, from the four winding and far-flowing rivers of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China,

<BR>From the southern peninsulas and the demi-continental

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; islands, from Malaysia,

<BR>These and whatever belongs to them palpable show forth to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me, and are seiz'd by me,

<BR>And I am seiz'd by them, and friendlily held by them,

<BR>Till as here them all I chant, Libertad! for themselves and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for you.



<P>&nbsp;



<P>For I too raising my voice join the ranks of this pageant,

<BR>I am the chanter, I chant aloud over the pageant,

<BR>I chant the world on my Western sea,

<BR>I chant copious the islands beyond, thick as stars in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sky,

<BR>I chant the new empire grander than any before, as in a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vision it comes to me,

<BR>I chant America the mistress, I chant a greater supremacy,

<BR>I chant projected a thousand blooming cities yet in time on

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those groups of sea-islands,

<BR>My sail-ships and steam-ships threading the archipelagoes,

<BR>My stars and stripes fluttering in the wind,

<BR>Commerce opening, the sleep of ages having done its work,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; races reborn, refresh'd,

<BR>Lives, works resumed &amp;emdash; the object I know not &amp;emdash;

but the old,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Asiatic renew'd as it must be,

<BR>Commencing from this day surrounded by the world.

<CENTER>3</CENTER>

And you Libertad of the world!

<BR>You shall sit in the middle well-pois'd thousands and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thousands of years,

<BR>As to-day from one side the nobles of Asia come to you,

<BR>As to-morrow from the other side the queen of England sends

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her eldest son to you.

<BR>The sign is reversing, the orb is enclosed,

<BR>The ring is circled, the journey is done,

<BR>The box-lid is but perceptibly open'd, nevertheless the perfume

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pours copiously out of the whole box.

<BR>Young Libertad! with the venerable Asia, the all-mother,

<BR>Be considerate with her now and ever hot Libertad, for you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are all,

<BR>Bend your proud neck to the long-off mother now sending

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; messages over the archipelagoes to you,

<BR>Bend your proud neck low for once, young Libertad.

<BR>Were the children straying westward so long? so wide the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tramping?

<BR>Were the precedent dim ages debouching westward from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradise so long?

<BR>Were the centuries steadily footing it that way, all the while

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unknown, for you, for reasons?

<BR>They are justified, they are accomplish'd, they shall now be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn'd the other way also, to travel toward

you thence,

<BR>They shall now also march obediently eastward for your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sake Libertad.

<BR>I shall traverse the States awhile, but I cannot tell whither or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how long,

<BR>Perhaps soon some day or night while I am singing my voice

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will suddenly cease.

YEARS OF THE MODERN</H2></CENTER>

Y<FONT SIZE=-1>EARS</FONT> of the modern! years of the unperform'd!

<BR>Your horizon rises, I see it parting away for more august

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dramas,

<BR>I see not America only, not only Liberty's nation but other

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nations preparing,

<BR>I see tremendous entrances and exits, new combinations, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; solidarity of races,

<BR>I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world's stage,

<BR>(Have the old forces, the old wars, played their parts? are the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acts suitable to them closed?)

<BR>I see Freedom, completely arm'd and victorious and very

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; haughty, with Law on one side and Peace on

the other,

<BR>A stupendous trio all issuing forth against the idea of caste;



<P>&nbsp;What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?

<BR>I see men marching and countermarching by swift millions,

<BR>I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; broken,

<BR>I see the landmarks of European kings removed,

<BR>I see this day the People beginning their landmarks, (all others

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; give way;)

<BR>Never were such sharp questions ask'd as this day,

<BR>Never was average man, his soul, more energetic, more like a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God,

<BR>Lo, how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest!

<BR>His daring foot is on land and sea everywhere, he colonizes

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Pacific, the archipelagoes,

<BR>With the steamship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wholesale engines of war,

<BR>With these and the world-spreading factories he interlinks all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; geography, all lands;

<BR>What whispers are these O lands, running ahead of you,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passing under the seas?

<BR>Are all nations communing? is there going to be but one

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heart to the globe?

<BR>Is humanity forming en-masse? for lo, tyrants tremble,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crowns grow dim,

<BR>The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; divine war,

<BR>No one knows what will happen next, such portents fill the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; days and nights;

<BR>Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to pierce it, is full of phantoms,

<BR>Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,

<BR>This incredible rush and heat, this strange ecstatic fever of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dreams O years!

<BR>Your dreams O years, how they penetrate through me! (I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know not whether I sleep or wake;)

<BR>The perform'd America and Europe grow dim, retiring in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shadow behind me,

<BR>The unperform'd, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon me.

ASHES OF SOLDIERS</H2></CENTER>

A<FONT SIZE=-1>SHES</FONT> of soldiers South or North,

<BR>As I muse retrospective murmuring a chant in thought,

<BR>The war resumes, again to my sense your shapes,

<BR>And again the advance of the armies.



<P>&nbsp;Noiseless as mists and vapors,

<BR>From their graves in the trenches ascending,

<BR>From cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee,

<BR>From every point of the compass out of the countless graves,

<BR>In wafted clouds, in myriads large, or squads of twos or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; threes or single ones they come,

<BR>And silently gather round me.



<P>&nbsp;Now sound no note O trumpeters,

<BR>Not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses,

<BR>With sabres drawn and glistening, and carbines by their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thighs, (ah my brave horsemen!

<BR>My handsome tan-faced horsemen! what life, what joy and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pride,

<BR>With all the perils were yours.)



<P>&nbsp;Nor you drummers, neither at reveill&eacute; at dawn,

<BR>Nor the long roll alarming the camp, nor even the muffled

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beat for a burial,

<BR>Nothing from you this time O drummers bearing my warlil

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drums.



<P>&nbsp;But aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; promenade,

<BR>Admitting around me comrades close unseen by the rest and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; voiceless,

<BR>The slain elate and alive again, the dust and debris alive,

<BR>I chant this chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soldiers.



<P>&nbsp;Faces so pale with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet,

<BR>Draw close, but speak not.



<P>&nbsp;Phantoms of countless lost,

<BR>Invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions,

<BR>Follow me ever &amp;emdash; desert me not while I live.



<P>&nbsp;Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living &amp;emdash; sweet

are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the musical voices sounding,

<BR>But sweet, ah sweet, are the dead with their silent eyes.



<P>&nbsp;Dearest comrades, all is over and long gone,

<BR>But love is not over &amp;emdash; and what love, O comrades

<BR>Perfume from battle-fields rising, up from the foetor arising.



<P>&nbsp;Perfume therefore my chant, O love, immortal love,

<BR>Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers,

<BR>Shroud them, embalm them, cover them all over with tender

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pride.



<P>&nbsp;Perfume all &amp;emdash; make all wholesome,

<BR>Make these ashes to nourish and blossom,

<BR>O love, solve all, fructify all with the last chemistry.



<P>&nbsp;Give me exhaustless, make me a fountain,

<BR>That I exhale love from me wherever I go like a moist

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perennial dew,

<BR>For the ashes of all dead soldiers South or North.

THOUGHTS</H2></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>





<P>O<FONT SIZE=-1>F</FONT> these years I sing,

<BR>How they pass and have pass'd through convuls'd pains, as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through parturitions,

<BR>How America illustrates birth, muscular youth, the promise,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sure fulfilment, the absolute success,

despite of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people &amp;emdash; illustrates evil as well

as good,

<BR>The vehement struggle so fierce for unity in one's -self;

<BR>How many hold despairingly yet to the models departed, caste,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myths, obedience, compulsion, and to infidelity,

<BR>How few see the arrived models, the athletes, the Western

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; States, or see freedom or spirituality, or

hold any faith

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in results,



<P>&nbsp;(But I see the athletes, and I see the results of the war glorious

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and inevitable, and they again leading to

other results.)



<P>&nbsp;How the great cities appear &amp;emdash; how the Democratic

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; masses, turbulent, wilful, as I love them,

<BR>How the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with good, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sounding and resounding, keep on and on,

<BR>How society waits unform'd, and is for a while between things

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ended and things begun,

<BR>How America is the continent of glories, and of the triumph

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of freedom and of the Democracies, and of

the fruits of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; society, and of all that is begun,

<BR>And how the States are complete in themselves &amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and how all triumphs and glories are complete

in themselves,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to lead onward,

<BR>And how these of mine and of the States will in their turn be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; convuls'd, and serve other parturitions and

transitions,

<BR>And how all people, sights, combinations, the democratic

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; masses too, serve &amp;emdash; and how every

fact, and war

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself, with all its horrors, serves,

<BR>And how now or at any time each serves the exquisite

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transition of death.

<P>Of seeds dropping into the ground, of births,

<BR>Of the steady concentration of America, inland, upward, to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; impregnable and swarming places,

<BR>Of what Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, and the rest, are to be,

<BR>Of what a few years will show there in Nebraska, Colorado,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevada, and the rest,

<BR>(Or afar, mounting the Northern Pacific to Sitka or Aliaska,)

<BR>Of what the feuillage of America is the preparation for &amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and of what all sights, North, South, East

and West, are,

<BR>Of this Union welded in blood, of the solemn price paid, of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the unnamed lost ever present in my mind;

<BR>Of the temporary use of materials for identity's sake,

<BR>Of the present, passing, departing &amp;emdash; of the growth

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of completer men than any yet,

<BR>Of all sloping down there where the fresh free giver the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother, the Mississippi flows,



<P>&nbsp;Of mighty inland cities yet unsurvey'd and unsuspected,

<BR>Of the new and good names, of the modern developments,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of inalienable homesteads,

<BR>Of a free and original life there, of simple diet and clean

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sweet blood,

<BR>Of litheness, majestic faces, clear eyes, and perfect physique

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there,

<BR>Of immense spiritual results future years far West, each side

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Anahuacs,

<BR>Of these songs, well understood there, (being made for that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; area,)

<BR>Of the native scorn of grossness and gain there,

<BR>(O it lurks in me night and day &amp;emdash; what is gain after

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all to savageness and freedom?)

SONG AT SUNSET</H2></CENTER>

S<FONT SIZE=-1>PLENDOR</FONT> of ended day floating and filling me,

<BR>Hour prophetic, hour resuming the past,

<BR>Inflating my throat, you divine average,

<BR>You earth and life till the last ray gleams I sing.



<P>&nbsp;Open mouth of my soul uttering gladness,

<BR>Eyes of my soul seeing perfection,

<BR>Natural life of me faithfully praising things,

<BR>Corroborating forever the triumph of things.



<P>&nbsp;Illustrious every one!

<BR>Illustrious what we name space, sphere of unnumber'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spirits,

<BR>Illustrious the mystery of motion in all beings, even the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tiniest insect,

<BR>Illustrious the attribute of speech, the senses, the body,

<BR>Illustrious the passing light &amp;emdash; illustrious the pale

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reflection on the new moon in the western

sky,

<BR>Illustrious whatever I see or hear or touch, to the last.



<P>&nbsp;Good in all,

<BR>In the satisfaction and aplomb of animals,

<BR>In the annual return of the seasons,



<P>&nbsp;In the hilarity of youth,

<BR>In the strength and flush of manhood,

<BR>In the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age,

<BR>In the superb vistas of death.



<P>&nbsp;Wonderful to depart!

<BR>Wonderful to be here!

<BR>The heart, to jet the all-alike and innocent blood!

<BR>To breathe the air, how delicious!

<BR>To speak &amp;emdash; to walk &amp;emdash; to seize something

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the hand!

<BR>To prepare for sleep, for bed, to look on my rose-color'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flesh!

<BR>To be conscious of my body, so satisfied, so large!

<BR>To be this incredible God I am!

<BR>To have gone forth among other Gods, these men and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women I love.



<P>&nbsp;Wonderful how I celebrate you and myself!

<BR>How my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around!

<BR>How the clouds pass silently overhead!

<BR>How the earth darts on and on! and how the sun, moon,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stars, dart on and on!

<BR>How the water sports and sings! (surely it is alive!)

<BR>How the trees rise and stand up, with strong trunks,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with branches and leaves!

<BR>(Surely there is something more in each of the trees, some

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; living soul.)



<P>&nbsp;O amazement of things &amp;emdash; even the least particle!

<BR>O spirituality of things!

<BR>O strain musical flowing through ages and continents, now

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reaching me and America!

<BR>I take your strong chords, intersperse them, and cheerfully

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pass them forward.



<P>&nbsp;I too carol the sun, usher'd or at noon, or as now, setting,

<BR>I too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth and of all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the growths of the earth,

<BR>I too have felt the resistless call of myself.



<P>&nbsp;As I steam'd down the Mississippi,

<BR>As I wander'd over the prairies,

<BR>As I have lived, as I have look'd through my windows my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eyes,

<BR>As I went forth in the morning, as I beheld the light breaking

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the east,

<BR>As I bathed on the beach of the Eastern Sea, and again on

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the beach of Western Sea,

<BR>As I roam'd the streets of inland Chicago, whatever streets

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have roam'd,

<BR>Or cities or silent woods, or even amid the sights of war,

<BR>Wherever I have been I have charged myself with content-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ment and triumph.



<P>&nbsp;I sing to the last the equalities modern or old,

<BR>I sing the endless final&eacute;s of things,

<BR>I say Nature continues, glory continues,

<BR>I praise with electric voice,

<BR>For I do not see one imperfection in the universe,

<BR>And I do not see one cause or result lamentable at last

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the universe.



<P>&nbsp;O setting sun! though the time has come,

<BR>I still warble under you, if none else does, unmitigated

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adoration.

PENSIVE ON HER DEAD GAZING</H2></CENTER>

P<FONT SIZE=-1>ENSIVE</FONT> on her dead gazing I heard the Mother of All,

<BR>Desperate on the torn bodies, on the forms covering the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; battle-fields gazing,

<BR>(As the last gun ceased, but the scent of the powder-smoke

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; linger'd,)

<BR>As she call'd to her earth with mournful voice while she

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stalk'd,

<BR>Absorb them well O my earth, she cried, I charge you lose

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not my sons, lose not an atom,

<BR>And you streams absorb them well, taking their dear blood,

<BR>And you local spots, and you airs that swim above lightly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; impalpable,

<BR>And all you essences of soil and growth, and you my rivers'

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; depths,

<BR>And you mountain sides, and the woods where my dear

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; children's blood trickling redden'd,

<BR>And you trees down in your roots to bequeath to all future

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trees,

<BR>My dead absorb or South or North &amp;emdash; my young

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men's bodies absorb, and their precious precious

blood,



<P>&nbsp;Which holding in trust for me faithfully back again give me

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many a year hence,

<BR>In unseen essence and odor of surface and grass, centuries

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hence,

<BR>In blowing airs from the fields back again give me my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; darlings, give my immortal heroes,

<BR>Exhale me them centuries hence, breathe me their breath, let

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not an atom be lost,

<BR>O years and graves! O air and soil! O my dead, an aroma

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweet!

<BR>Exhale them perennial sweet death, years, centuries hence.

<BR>Some of us so fatigued carrying the gun and knapsack, drop-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ping asleep in our tracks,

<BR>Others pitching the little tents, and the fires lit up begin to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sparkle,

<BR>Outposts of pickets posted surrounding alert through the

<BR>And a word provided for countersign, careful for safety,

<BR>With a mystic army, (is it too order'd forward? is it too

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only halting awhile,

<P>&nbsp;Sleeping under the sunlight, sleeping under the moonlight,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content and silent there at last,

<BR>Behold the mighty bivouac-field and waiting-camp of all,

<BR>Of the corps and generals all, and the President over the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corps and generals all,

<BR>And of each of us O soldiers, and of each and all in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ranks we fought,

<BR>(There without hatred we all, all meet.)



<P>&nbsp;For presently O soldiers, we too camp in our place in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bivouac-camps of green,

<BR>But we need not provide for outposts, nor word for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the counter-sign,

<BR>Nor drummer to beat the morning drum.

<CENTER>

<H2>

SO LONG!</H2></CENTER>

To conclude, I announce what comes after me.



<P>&nbsp;I remember I said before my leaves sprang at all,

<BR>I would raise my voice jocund and strong with reference to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consummations.



<P>&nbsp;When America does what was promis'd,

<BR>When through these States walk a hundred millions of superb

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persons,

<BR>When the rest part away for superb persons and contribute

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to them,

<BR>When breeds of the most perfect mothers denote America,

<BR>Then to me and mine our due fruition.



<P>&nbsp;I have press'd through in my own right,

<BR>I have sung the body and the soul, war and peace have I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sung, and the songs of life and death,

<BR>And the songs of birth, and shown that there are many

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; births.



<P>&nbsp;I have offer'd my style to every one, I have journey'd with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confident step;

<BR>While my pleasure is yet at the full I whisper <I>So long</I>!

<BR>And take the young woman's hand and the young man's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand for the last time.



<P>&nbsp;I announce natural persons to arise,

<BR>I announce justice triumphant,

<BR>I announce uncompromising liberty and equality,

<BR>I announce the justification of candor and the justification

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of pride.



<P>&nbsp;I announce that the identity of these States is a single identity

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only,

<BR>I announce the Union more and more compact, indissoluble,

<BR>I announce splendors and majesties to make all the previous

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; politics of the earth insignificant.



<P>&nbsp;I announce adhesiveness, I say it shall be limitless, un-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loosen'd,

<BR>I say you shall yet find the friend you were looking for.



<P>&nbsp;I announce a man or woman coming, perhaps you are the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one, (<I>So long</I>!)

<BR>I announce the great individual, fluid as Nature, chaste,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affectionate, compassionate, fully arm'd.



<P>&nbsp;I announce a life that shall be copious, vehement, spiritual,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bold,

<BR>I announce an end that shall lightly and joyfully meet its

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; translation.



<P>&nbsp;I announce myriads of youths, beautiful, gigantic, sweet-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blooded,

<BR>I announce a race of splendid and savage old men.



<P>&nbsp;O thicker and faster &amp;emdash; (<I>So long</I>!)

<BR>O crowding too close upon me,

<BR>I foresee too much, it means more than I thought,

<BR>It appears to me I am dying.



<P>&nbsp;Hasten throat and sound your last,

<BR>Salute me &amp;emdash; salute the days once more. Peal the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; old cry once more.



<P>&nbsp;Screaming electric, the atmosphere using,

<BR>At random glancing, each as I notice absorbing,

<BR>Swiftly on, but a little while alighting,

<BR>Curious envelop'd messages delivering,

<BR>Sparkles hot, seed ethereal down in the dirt dropping,

<BR>Myself unknowing, my commission obeying, to question

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it never daring,

<BR>To ages and ages yet the growth of the seed leaving,



<P>&nbsp;To troops out of the war arising, they the tasks I have set

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; promulging,

<BR>To women certain whispers of myself bequeathing, their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affection me more clearly explaining,

<BR>To young men my problems offering &amp;emdash; no dallier

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I &amp;emdash; I the muscle of their brains

trying,

<BR>So I pass, a little time vocal, visible, contrary,

<BR>Afterward a melodious echo, passionately bent for, (death

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making me really undying,)

<BR>The best of me then when no longer visible, for toward that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been incessantly preparing.



<P>&nbsp;What is there more, that I lag and pause and crouch extended

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with unshut mouth?

<BR>Is there a single final farewell?



<P>&nbsp;My songs cease, I abandon them,

<BR>From behind the screen where I hid I advance personally

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; solely to you.



<P>&nbsp;Camerado, this is no book,

<BR>Who touches this touches a man,

<BR>(Is it night? are we here together alone?)

<BR>It is I you hold and who holds you,

<BR>I spring from the pages into your arms &amp;emdash; decease

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calls me forth.



<P>&nbsp;O how your fingers drowse me,

<BR>Your breath falls around me like dew, your pulse lulls the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tympans of my ears,

<BR>I feel immerged from head to foot,

<BR>Delicious, enough.



<P>&nbsp;Enough O deed impromptu and secret,

<BR>Enough O gliding present &amp;emdash; enough O summ'd-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up past.



<P>&nbsp;Dear friend whoever you are take this kiss,

<BR>I give it especially to you, do not forget me,

<BR>I feel like one who has done work for the day to retire

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; awhile,

<BR>I receive now again of my many translations, from my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; avataras ascending, while others doubtless

await me,



<P>&nbsp;An unknown sphere more real than I dream'd, more

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; direct, darts awakening rays about me, <I>So

long</I>!

<BR>Remember my words, I may again return,

<BR>I love you, I depart from materials,

<BR>I am as one disembodied, triumphant, dead.

<CENTER>1</CENTER>





<P>S<FONT SIZE=-1>TARTING</FONT> from fish-shape Paumanok where I was born,

<BR>Well-begotten, and rais'd by a perfect mother,

<BR>After roaming many lands, lover of populous pavements,

<BR>Dweller in Mannahatta my city, or on southern savannas,

<BR>Or a soldier camp'd or carrying my knapsack and gun, or a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miner in California,

<BR>Or rude in my home in Dakota's woods, my diet meat, my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drink from the spring,

<BR>Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess,

<BR>Far from the clank of crowds intervals passing rapt and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happy,

<BR>Aware of the fresh free giver the flowing Missouri, aware of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mighty Niagara,

<BR>Aware of the buffalo herds grazing the plains, the hirsute and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong-breasted bull,

<BR>Of earth, rocks, Fifth-month flowers experienced, stars, rain,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; snow, my amaze,

<BR>Having studied the mocking-bird's tones and the flight of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mountain-hawk,

<BR>And heard at dawn the unrivall'd one, the hermit thrush

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the swamp-cedars,

<BR>Solitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New World.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>2</CENTER>





<P>Victory, union, faith, identity, time,

<BR>The indissoluble compacts, riches, mystery,

<BR>Eternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports.



<P>&nbsp;This then is life,

<BR>Here is what has come to the surface after so many throes

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and convulsions.

<BR>How curious! how real!

<BR>Underfoot the divine soil, overhead the sun.



<P>&nbsp;See revolving the globe,

<BR>The ancestor-continents away group'd together,

<BR>The present and future continents north and south, with the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; isthmus between.



<P>&nbsp;See, vast trackless spaces,

<BR>As in a dream they change, they swiftly fill,

<BR>Countless masses debouch upon them,

<BR>They are now cover'd with the foremost people, arts,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; institutions, known.



<P>&nbsp;See, projected through time,

<BR>For me an audience interminable.



<P>&nbsp;With firm and regular step they wend, they never stop,

<BR>Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions,

<BR>One generation playing its part and passing on,

<BR>Another generation playing its part and passing on in its turn,

<BR>With faces turn'd sideways or backward towards me to listen,

<BR>With eyes retrospective towards me.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>3</CENTER>





<P>Americanos! conquerors! marches humanitarian!

<BR>Foremost! century marches! Libertad! masses!

<BR>For you a programme of chants.



<P>&nbsp;Chants of the prairies,

<BR>Chants of the long-running Mississippi, and down to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mexican sea,

<BR>Chants of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minnesota,

<BR>Chants going forth from the centre from Kansas, and thence

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equidistant,

<BR>Shooting in pulses of fire ceaseless to vivify all.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>4</CENTER>





<P>Take my leaves America, take them South and take them

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; North,

<BR>Make welcome for them everywhere, for they are your own

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offspring,

<BR>Surround them East and West, for they would surround you,

<BR>And you precedents, connect lovingly with them, for they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connect lovingly with you.



<P>&nbsp;I conn'd old times,

<BR>I sat studying at the feet of the great masters,

<BR>Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; study me.



<P>&nbsp;In the name of these States shall I scorn the antique?

<BR>Why these are the children of the antique to justify it.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>5</CENTER>





<P>Dead poets, philosophs, priests,

<BR>Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since,

<BR>Language-shapers on other shores,

<BR>Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,

<BR>I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wafted hither,

<BR>I have perused it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it,)

<BR>Think nothing can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than it deserves,

<BR>Regarding it all intently a long while, then dismissing it,

<BR>I stand in my place with my own day here.



<P>&nbsp;Here lands female and male,

<BR>Here the heir-ship and heiress-ship of the world, here the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flame of materials,

<BR>Here spirituality the translatress, the openly-avow'd,

<BR>The ever-tending, the final&egrave; of visible forms,

<BR>The satisfier, after due long-waiting now advancing,

<BR>Yes here comes my mistress the soul.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>6</CENTER>





<P>The soul,

<BR>Forever and forever&amp;emdash;longer than soil is brown and solid&amp;emdash;

<BR>longer than water ebbs and flows.

<BR>I will make the poems of materials, for I think they are to be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the most spiritual poems,

<BR>And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality,

<BR>For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soul and of immortality.



<P>&nbsp;I will make a song for these States that no one State may

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under any circumstances be subjected to another

State,

<BR>And I will make a song that there shall be comity by day and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by night between all the States, and between any

two of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,

<BR>And I will make a song for the ears of the President, full of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weapons with menacing points,

<BR>And behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces;

<BR>And a song make I of the One form'd out of all,

<BR>The fang'd and glittering One including and over all,

<BR>(However high the head of any else that head is over all.)



<P>&nbsp;I will acknowledge contemporary lands,

<BR>I will trail the whole geography of the globe and salute

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; courteously every city large and small,

<BR>And employments! I will put in my poems that with you is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heroism upon land and sea,

<BR>And I will report all heroism from an American point of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; view.



<P>&nbsp;I will sing the song of companionship,

<BR>I will show what alone must finally compact these,

<BR>I believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indicating it in me,

<BR>I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; threatening to consume me,

<BR>I will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fires,

<BR>I will give them complete abandonment,

<BR>I will write the evangel-poem of comrades and of love,

<BR>For who but I should understand love with all its sorrow and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; joy?

<BR>And who but I should be the poet of comrades?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>7</CENTER>





<P>I am the credulous man of qualities, ages, races,

<BR>I advance from the people in their own spirit,

<BR>Here is what sings unrestricted faith.



<P>&nbsp;Omnes! omnes! let others ignore what they may,

<BR>I make the poem of evil also, I commemorate that part also,

<BR>I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is&amp;emdash;and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I say there is in fact no evil,

<BR>(Or if there is I say it is just as important to you, to the land

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or to me, as any thing else.)



<P>&nbsp;I too, following many and follow'd by many, inaugurate a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; religion, I descend into the arena,

<BR>(It may be I am destin'd to utter the loudest cries there, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; winner's pealing shouts,

<BR>Who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every thing.)



<P>&nbsp;Each is not for its own sake,

<BR>I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; religion's sake.



<P>&nbsp;I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough,

<BR>None has ever yet adored or worship'd half enough,

<BR>None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certain the future is.



<P>&nbsp;I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; must be their religion,

<BR>Otherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur;

<BR>(Nor character nor life worthy the name without religion,

<BR>Nor land nor man or woman without religion.)



<P>&nbsp;

<P>What are you doing young man?

<BR>Are you so earnest, so given up to literature, science, art,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amours?

<BR>These ostensible realities, politics, points?

<BR>Your ambition or business whatever it may be?



<P>&nbsp;It is well&amp;emdash;against such I say not a word, I am their

poet also,

<BR>But behold! such swiftly subside, burnt up for religion's sake,

<BR>For not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; essential life of the earth,

<BR>Any more than such are to religion.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>9</CENTER>





<P>What do you seek so pensive and silent?

<BR>What do you need camerado?

<BR>Dear son do you think it is love?



<P>&nbsp;Listen dear son&amp;emdash;listen America, daughter or son,

<BR>It is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet it satisfies, it is great,

<BR>But there is something else very great, it makes the whole

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coincide,

<BR>It, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous hands

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweeps and provides for all.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>10</CENTER>





<P>Know you, solely to drop in the earth the germs of a greater

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; religion,

<BR>The following chants each for its kind I sing.



<P>&nbsp;My comrade!

<BR>For you to share with me two greatnesses, and a third one

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rising inclusive and more resplendent,

<BR>The greatness of Love and Democracy, and the greatness of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Religion.



<P>&nbsp;Melange mine own, the unseen and the seen,

<BR>Mysterious ocean where the streams empty,

<BR>Prophetic spirit of material shifting and flickering around

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,

<BR>Living beings, identities now doubtless near us in the air that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we know not of,

<BR>Contact daily and hourly that will not release me,

<BR>These selecting, these in hints demanded of me.



<P>&nbsp;Not he with a daily kiss onward from childhood kissing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,

<BR>Has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him,

<BR>Any more than I am held to the heavens and all the spiritual

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world,

<BR>After what they have done to me, suggesting themes.



<P>&nbsp;O such themes&amp;emdash;equalities! O divine average!

<BR>Warblings under the sun, usher'd as now, or at noon, or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setting,

<BR>Strains musical flowing through ages, now reaching hither,

<BR>I take to your reckless and composite chords, add to them,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and cheerfully pass them forward.



<P>&nbsp;

<P>As I have walk'd in Alabama my morning walk,

<BR>I have seen where the she-bird the mocking-bird sat on her

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nest in the briers hatching her brood.



<P>&nbsp;I have seen the he-bird also,

<BR>I have paus'd to hear him near at hand inflating his throat

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and joyfully singing.



<P>&nbsp;And while I paus'd it came to me that what he really sang for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was not there only,

<BR>Nor for his mate nor himself only, nor all sent back by the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echoes,

<BR>But subtle, clandestine, away beyond,

<BR>A charge transmitted and gift occult for those being born.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>12</CENTER>





<P>Democracy! near at hand to you a throat is now inflating

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself and joyfully singing.



<P>&nbsp;Ma femme! for the brood beyond us and of us,

<BR>For those who belong here and those to come,

<BR>I exultant to be ready for them will now shake out carols

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stronger and haughtier than have ever yet

been heard

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon earth.

<BR>I will make the songs of passion to give them their way,

<BR>And your songs outlaw'd offenders, for I scan you with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kindred eyes, and carry you with me the same

as any.



<P>&nbsp;I will make the true poem of riches,

<BR>To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goes forward and is not dropt by death;

<BR>I will effuse egotism and show it underlying all, and I will be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bard of personality,

<BR>And I will show of male and female that either is but the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equal of the other,

<BR>And sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in me, for I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; am determin'd to tell you with courageous

clear voice to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prove you illustrious,

<BR>And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and can be none in the future,

<BR>And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it may be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn'd to beautiful results,

<BR>And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; death,

<BR>And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; events are compact,

<BR>And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each as profound as any.



<P>&nbsp;I will not make poems with reference to parts,

<BR>But I will make poems, songs, thoughts, with reference to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ensemble,

<BR>And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to all days,

<BR>And I will not make a poem nor the least part of a poem but

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has reference to the soul,

<BR>Because having look'd at the objects of the universe, I find

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is no one nor any particle of one but

has reference

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the soul.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>13</CENTER>





<P>Was somebody asking to see the soul?

<BR>See, your own shape and countenance, persons, substances,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beasts, the trees, the running rivers, the

rocks and sands.



<P>&nbsp;All hold spiritual joys and afterwards loosen them;

<BR>How can the real body ever die and be buried?



<P>&nbsp;Of your real body and any man's or woman's real body,

<BR>Item for item it will elude the hands of the corpse-cleaners

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and pass to fitting spheres,

<BR>Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the moment of death.



<P>&nbsp;Not the types set up by the printer return their impression,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the meaning, the main concern,

<BR>Any more than a man's substance and life or a woman's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; substance and life return in the body and

the soul,

<BR>Indifferently before death and after death.



<P>&nbsp;Behold, the body includes and is the meaning, the main

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concern, and includes and is the soul;

<BR>Whoever you are, how superb and how divine is your body,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or any part of it!



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>14</CENTER>





<P>Whoever you are, to you endless announcements!



<P>&nbsp;Daughter of the lands did you wait for your poet?

<BR>Did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand?

<BR>Toward the male of the States, and toward the female of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; States,

<BR>Exulting words, words to Democracy's lands.



<P>&nbsp;Interlink'd, food-yielding lands!

<BR>Land of coal and iron! land of gold! land of cotton, sugar,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rice!

<BR>Land of wheat, beef, pork! land of wool and hemp! land of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the apple and the grape!

<BR>Land of the pastoral plains, the grass-fields of the world! land

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of those sweet-air'd interminable plateaus!

<BR>Land of the herd, the garden, the healthy house of adobie!

<BR>Lands where the north-west Columbia winds, and where the

<BR>Land of the eastern Chesapeake! land of the Delaware!

<BR>Land of Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan!

<BR>Land of the Old Thirteen! Massachusetts land! land of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vermont and Connecticut!



<P>&nbsp;Land of the ocean shores! land of sierras and peaks!

<BR>Land of boatmen and sailors! fishermen's land!

<BR>Inextricable lands! the clutch'd together! the passionate

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ones!

<BR>The side by side! the elder and younger brothers! the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bony-limb'd!

<BR>The great women's land! the feminine! the experienced sisters

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the inexperienced sisters!

<BR>Far breath'd land! Arctic braced! Mexican breez'd! the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; diverse! the compact!

<BR>The Pennsylvanian! the Virginian! the double Carolinian!

<BR>O all and each well-loved by me! my intrepid nations! O I at

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any rate include you all with perfect love!

<BR>I cannot be discharged from you! not from one any sooner

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than another!

<BR>O death! O for all that, I am yet of you unseen this hour with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; irrepressible love,

<BR>Walking New England, a friend, a traveler,

<BR>Splashing my bare feet in the edge of the summer ripples on

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paumanok's sands,

<BR>Crossing the prairies, dwelling again in Chicago, dwelling in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every town,

<BR>Observing shows, births, improvements, structures, arts,

<BR>Listening to orators and oratresses in public halls,

<BR>Of and through the States as during life, each man and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; woman my neighbor,

<BR>The Louisianian, the Georgian, as near to me, and I as near

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to him and her,

<BR>The Mississippian and Arkansian yet with me, and I yet with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any of them,

<BR>Yet upon the plains west of the spinal river, yet in my house

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of adobie,

<BR>Yet returning eastward, yet in the Seaside State or in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maryland,

<BR>Yet Kanadian cheerily braving the winter, the snow and ice

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; welcome to me,

<BR>Yet a true son either of Maine or of the Granite State, or the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Narragansett Bay State, or the Empire State,

<BR>Yet sailing to other shores to annex the same, yet welcoming

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every new brother,



<P>&nbsp;Hereby applying these leaves to the new ones from the hour

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they unite with the old ones,

<BR>Coming among the new ones myself to be their companion

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and equal, coming personally to you now,

<BR>Enjoining you to acts, characters, spectacles, with me.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>15</CENTER>





<P>With me with firm holding, yet haste, haste on.



<P>&nbsp;For your life adhere to me,

<BR>(I may have to be persuaded many times before I consent to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; give myself really to you, but what of that?

<BR>Must not Nature be persuaded many times?)



<P>&nbsp;No dainty dolce affettuoso I,

<BR>Bearded, sun-burnt, gray-neck'd, forbidding, I have arrived,

<BR>To be wrestled with as I pass for the solid prizes of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; universe,

<BR>For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>16</CENTER>





<P>On my way a moment I pause,

<BR>Here for you! and here for America!

<BR>Still the present I raise aloft, still the future of the States I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; harbinge glad and sublime,

<BR>And for the past I pronounce what the air holds of the red

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aborigines.



<P>&nbsp;The red aborigines,

<BR>Leaving natural breaths, sounds of rain and winds, calls as of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; birds and animals in the woods, syllabled,

to us for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; names,

<BR>Okonee, Koosa, Ottawa, Monongahela, Sauk, Natchez,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chattahoochee, Kaqueta, Oronoco,

<BR>Wabash, Miami, Saginaw, Chippewa, Oshkosh,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WallaWalla,

<BR>Leaving such to the States they melt, they depart, charging

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the water and the land with names.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>17</CENTER>





<P>Expanding and swift, henceforth,

<BR>Elements, breeds, adjustments, turbulent, quick and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; audacious,

<BR>A world primal again, vistas of glory incessant and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; branching,

<BR>A new race dominating previous ones and grander far, with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new contests,

<BR>New politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and arts.



<P>&nbsp;These, my voice announcing &amp;emdash; I will sleep no more but

arise,

<BR>You oceans that have been calm within me! how I feel you,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fathomless, stirring, preparing unprecedented waves

and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; storms.

<P>See, steamers steaming through my poems,

<BR>See, in my poems immigrants continually coming and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; landing,

<BR>See, in arriere, the wigwam, the trail, the hunter's hut, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flatboat, the maize-leaf, the claim, the rude

fence, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the backwoods village,

<BR>See, on the one side the Western Sea and on the other the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eastern Sea, how they advance and retreat

upon my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poems as upon their own shores,

<BR>See, pastures and forests in my poems &amp;emdash; see, animals wild

and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tame &amp;emdash; see, beyond the Kaw, countless

herds of buffalo

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feeding on short curly grass,

<BR>See, in my poems, cities, solid, vast, inland, with paved

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; streets, with iron and stone edifices, ceaseless

vehicles,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and commerce,

<BR>See, the many-cylinder'd steam printing-press &amp;emdash; see, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electric telegraph stretching across the continent,

<BR>See, through Atlantica's depths pulses American Europe

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reaching, pulses of Europe duly return'd,

<BR>See, the strong and quick locomotive as it departs, panting,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blowing the steam-whistle,

<BR>See, ploughmen ploughing farms &amp;emdash; see, miners digging mines

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash; see, the numberless factories,



<P>&nbsp;See, mechanics busy at their benches with tools &amp;emdash; see

from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; among them superior judges, philosophs, Presidents,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; emerge, drest in working dresses,

<BR>See, lounging through the shops and fields of the States, me

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well-belov'd, close-held by day and night,

<BR>Hear the loud echoes of my songs there &amp;emdash; read the hints

come

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at last.

<P>O camerado close! O you and me at last, and us two only.

<BR>O a word to clear one's path ahead endlessly!

<BR>O something ecstatic and undemonstrable! O music wild!

<P>F<FONT SIZE=-1>LOOD-TIDE</FONT> below me! I see you face to face!

<BR>Clouds of the west&amp;emdash;sun there half an hour high

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash;I see you also face to face.



<P>&nbsp;Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how curious you are to me!

<BR>On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; returning home, are more curious to me than

you suppose,

<BR>And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more to me, and more in my meditations, than

you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; might suppose.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>2</CENTER>





<P>The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the day,

<BR>The simple, compact, well-join'd scheme, myself disinte-grated,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme,

<BR>The similitudes of the past and those of the future,

<BR>The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hearings, on the walk in the street and the

passage over

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the river,

<BR>The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,

<BR>The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,

<BR>The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.



<P>&nbsp;Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to shore,

<BR>Others will watch the run of the flood-tide,

<BR>Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and

east,

<BR>Others will see the islands large and small;



<P>&nbsp;Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; half an hour high,

<BR>A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; others will see them,

<BR>Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>3</CENTER>





<P>It avails not, time nor place&amp;emdash;distance avails not,

<BR>I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so many generations hence,

<BR>Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt,

<BR>Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd,

<BR>Just as you are refresh'd by the gladness of the river and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bright flow, I was refresh'd,

<BR>Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; current, I stood yet was hurried,

<BR>Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thick-stemm'd pipes of steamboats, I look'd.



<P>&nbsp;I too many and many a time cross'd the river of old,

<BR>Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; air floating with motionless wings, oscillating

their bodies,

<BR>Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left the rest in strong shadow,

<BR>Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the south,

<BR>Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,

<BR>Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,

<BR>Look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of my head in the sunlit water,

<BR>Look'd on the haze on the hills southward and south-west-ward,

<BR>Look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,

<BR>Look'd toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving,

<BR>Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,

<BR>Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at anchor,



<P>&nbsp;The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars,

<BR>The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slender serpentine pennants,

<BR>The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pilot-houses,

<BR>The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the wheels,

<BR>The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,

<BR>The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frolicsome crests and glistening,

<BR>The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the granite storehouses by the docks,

<BR>On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flank'd on each side by the barges, the hay-boat,

the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; belated lighter,

<BR>On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chimneys burning high and glaringly into the

night,

<BR>Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yellow light over the tops of houses, and

down into the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clefts of streets.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>4</CENTER>





<P>These and all else were to me the same as they are to you,

<BR>I loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river,

<BR>The men and women I saw were all near to me,

<BR>Others the same&amp;emdash;others who look back on me because I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look'd forward to them,

<BR>(The time will come, though I stop here to-day, and to-night.)



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>5</CENTER>





<P>What is it then between us?

<BR>What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?



<P>&nbsp;Whatever it is, it avails not&amp;emdash;distance avails not,

and place

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; avails not,

<BR>I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,

<BR>I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the waters around it,

<BR>I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me.



<P>&nbsp;In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,

<BR>In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; came upon me,

<BR>I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution,

<BR>I too had receiv'd identity by my body,

<BR>That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knew I should be of my body.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>6</CENTER>





<P>It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,

<BR>The dark threw its patches down upon me also,

<BR>The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious,

<BR>My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reality meagre?

<BR>Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,

<BR>I am he who knew what it was to be evil,

<BR>I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,

<BR>Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,

<BR>Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,

<BR>Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,

<BR>The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,

<BR>The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not wanting,

<BR>Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these wanting,

<BR>Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest,

<BR>Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men as they saw me approaching or passing,

<BR>Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaning of their flesh against me as I sat,

<BR>Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assembly, yet never told them a word,

<BR>Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gnawing, sleeping,

<BR>Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,

<BR>The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as we like,

<BR>Or as small as we like, or both great and small.

<P>Closer yet I approach you,

<BR>What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you&amp;emdash;I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laid in my stores in advance,

<BR>I consider'd long and seriously of you before you were born.



<P>&nbsp;Who was to know what should come home to me?

<BR>Who knows but I am enjoying this?

<BR>Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at you now, for all you cannot see me?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>8</CENTER>





<P>Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mast-hemm'd Manhattan?

<BR>River and sunset and scallop-edg'd waves of flood-tide?

<BR>The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twilight, and the belated lighter?



<P>&nbsp;What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with voices I love call me promptly and loudly

by my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nighest name as I approach?



<P>&nbsp;What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man that looks in my face?

<BR>Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?



<P>&nbsp;We understand then do we not?

<BR>What I promis'd without mentioning it, have you not accepted?

<BR>What the study could not teach&amp;emdash;what the preaching could

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not accomplish is accomplish'd, is it not?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>9</CENTER>





<P>Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!

<BR>Frolic on, created and scallop-edg'd waves!

<BR>Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the men and women generations after me!



<P>&nbsp;Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!

<BR>Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Brooklyn!

<BR>Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!

<BR>Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!

<BR>Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assembly!

<BR>Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me by my nighest name!

<BR>Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress!

<BR>Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one makes it!

<BR>Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ways be looking upon you;

<BR>Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet haste with the hasting current;

<BR>Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the air;

<BR>Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all downcast eyes have time to take it from

you!

<BR>Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any one's head, in the sunlit water!

<BR>Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; white-sail'd schooners, sloops, lighters!

<BR>Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower'd at sunset!

<BR>Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at nightfall! cast red and yellow light over

the tops

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the houses!

<BR>Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are,

<BR>You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul,

<BR>About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; divinest aromas,

<BR>Thrive, cities&amp;emdash;bring your freight, bring your shows,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ample and sufficient rivers,

<BR>Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual,

<BR>Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.



<P>&nbsp;You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers,

<BR>We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hence-forward,

<BR>Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yourselves from us,

<BR>We use you, and do not cast you aside&amp;emdash;we plant you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permanently within us,

<BR>We fathom you not&amp;emdash;we love you&amp;emdash;there is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perfection in you also,

<BR>You furnish your parts toward eternity,

<BR>Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.

<I>To Think of Time</I></H1></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>

To think of time&amp;emdash;of all that retrospection,

<BR>To think of to-day, and the ages continued henceforward.



<P>&nbsp;Have you guess'd you yourself would not continue?

<BR>Have you dreaded these earth-beetles?

<BR>Have you fear'd the future would be nothing to you?



<P>&nbsp;Is to-day nothing? is the beginningless past nothing?

<BR>If the future is nothing they are just as surely nothing.



<P>&nbsp;To think that the sun rose in the east&amp;emdash;that men and

women

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were flexible, real, alive&amp;emdash;that

every thing was alive,

<BR>To think that you and I did not see, feel, think, nor bear our

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part,

<BR>To think that we are now here and bear our part.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>2</CENTER>

Not a day passes, not a minute or second without an

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accouchement,

<BR>Not a day passes, not a minute or second without a corpse.



<P>&nbsp;The dull nights go over and the dull days also,

<BR>The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over,

<BR>The physician after long putting off gives the silent and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terrible look for an answer,

<BR>The children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sisters are sent for,

<BR>Medicines stand unused on the shelf, (the camphor-smell has

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long pervaded the rooms,)

<BR>The faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dying,

<BR>The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,

<BR>The breath ceases and the pulse of the heart ceases,

<BR>The corpse stretches on the bed and the living look upon it,

<BR>It is palpable as the living are palpable.



<P>&nbsp;The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,

<BR>But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; curiously on the corpse.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>3</CENTER>

To think the thought of death merged in the thought of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials,

<BR>To think of all these wonders of city and country, and others

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taking great interest in them, and we taking no

interest

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in them.



<P>&nbsp;To think how eager we are in building our houses,

<BR>To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indifferent.



<P>&nbsp;(I see one building the house that serves him a few years, or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seventy or eighty years at most,

<BR>I see one building the house that serves him longer than that.)



<P>&nbsp;Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth&amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they never cease&amp;emdash;they are the burial

lines,

<BR>He that was President was buried, and he that is now President

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall surely be buried.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>4</CENTER>

A reminiscence of the vulgar fate,

<BR>A frequent sample of the life and death of workmen,

<BR>Each after his kind.



<P>&nbsp;Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf, posh and ice in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; river, half-frozen mud in the streets,

<BR>A gray discouraged sky overhead, the short last daylight of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; December,

<BR>A hearse and stages, the funeral of an old Broadway stagedriver,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cortege mostly drivers.



<P>&nbsp;Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell,

<BR>The gate is pass'd, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alight, the hearse uncloses,

<BR>The coffin is pass'd out, lower'd and settled, the whip is laid

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovel'd in,

<BR>The mound above is flatted with the spades&amp;emdash;silence,

<BR>A minute&amp;emdash;no one moves or speaks&amp;emdash;it is done,

<BR>He is decently put away&amp;emdash;is there any thing more?



<P>&nbsp;He was a good fellow, free-mouth'd, quick-temper'd, not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bad-looking,

<BR>Ready with life or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ate hearty, drank hearty,

<BR>Had known what it was to be flush, grew low-spirited toward

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the last, sicken'd, was help'd by a contribution,

<BR>Died, aged forty-one years&amp;emdash;and that was his funeral.



<P>&nbsp;Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wet-weather clothes, whip carefully chosen,

<BR>Boss, spotter, starter, hostler, somebody loafing on you, you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loafing on somebody, headway, man before and man

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behind,

<BR>Good day's work, bad day's work, pet stock, mean stock,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; first out, last out, turning-in at night,

<BR>To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he there takes no interest in them.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>5</CENTER>

The markets, the government, the working-man's wages, to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; think what account they are through our nights and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; days,

<BR>To think that other working-men will make just as great

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; account of them, yet we make little or no account.



<P>&nbsp;The vulgar and the refined, what you call sin and what

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you call goodness, to think how wide a difference,

<BR>To think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beyond the difference.



<P>&nbsp;To think how much pleasure there is,

<BR>Do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; planning a nomination and election? or with your

wife

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and family?

<BR>Or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework?

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the beautiful maternal cares?

<BR>These also flow onward to others, you and I flow onward,

<BR>But in due time you and I shall take less interest in them.



<P>&nbsp;Your farm, profits, crops&amp;emdash;to think how engross'd you

are,

<BR>To think there will still be farms, profits, crops, yet for you of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what avail?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>6</CENTER>

What will be will be well, for what is is well,

<BR>To take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well.



<P>&nbsp;The domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; building of houses, are not phantasms, they have

weight,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; form, location,

<BR>Farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of them phantasms,

<BR>The difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,

<BR>The earth is not an echo, man and his life and all the things of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his life are well-consider'd.



<P>&nbsp;You are not thrown to the winds, you gather certainly and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; safely around yourself,

<BR>Yourself! yourself! yourself, for ever and ever!



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>7</CENTER>

It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and father, it is to identify you,

<BR>It is not that you should be undecided, but that you should

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be decided,

<BR>Something long preparing and formless is arrived and form'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in you,

<BR>You are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes.



<P>&nbsp;The threads that were spun are gather'd, the weft crosses the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; warp, the pattern is systematic.



<P>The preparations have every one been justified,

<BR>The orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the baton has given the signal.



<P>&nbsp;The guest that was coming, he waited long, he is now housed,

<BR>He is one of those who are beautiful and happy, he is one of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those that to look upon and be with is enough.



<P>&nbsp;The law of the past cannot be eluded,

<BR>The law of the present and future cannot be eluded,

<BR>The law of the living cannot be eluded, it is eternal,

<BR>The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,

<BR>The law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded,

<BR>The law of drunkards, informers, mean persons, not one iota

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thereof can be eluded.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>8</CENTER>

Slow moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,

<BR>Northerner goes carried and Southerner goes carried, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they on the Atlantic side and they on the Pacific,

<BR>And they between, and all through the Mississippi country,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and all over the earth.



<P>&nbsp;The great masters and kosmos are well as they go, the heroes

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and good-doers are well,

<BR>The known leaders and inventors and the rich owners and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pious and distinguish'd may be well,

<BR>But there is more account than that, there is strict account of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all.



<P>&nbsp;The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing,

<BR>The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing,

<BR>The perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as they go.



<P>&nbsp;Of and in all these things,

<BR>I have dream'd that we are not to be changed so much, nor

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the law of us changed,

<BR>I have dream'd that heroes and good-doers shall be under the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; present and past law,

<BR>And that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; present and past law,

<BR>For I have dream'd that the law they are under now is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enough.



<P>&nbsp;And I have dream'd that the purpose and essence of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; known life, the transient,

<BR>Is to form and decide identity for the unknown life, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permanent.



<P>&nbsp;If all came but to ashes of dung,

<BR>If maggots and rats ended us, then Alarum! for we are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; betray'd,

<BR>Then indeed suspicion of death.



<P>&nbsp;Do you suspect death? if I were to suspect death I should die

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now,

<BR>Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; annihilation?



<P>&nbsp;Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,

<BR>Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good,

<BR>The whole universe indicates that it is good,

<BR>The past and the present indicate that it is good.



<P>&nbsp;How beautiful and perfect are the animals!

<BR>How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!

<BR>What is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as perfect,

<BR>The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imponderable fluids perfect;

<BR>Slowly and surely they have pass'd on to this, and slowly and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surely they yet pass on.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>9</CENTER>

I swear I think now that every thing without exception has an

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eternal soul!

<BR>The trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds of the sea

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have! the animals!



<P>&nbsp;I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!

<BR>That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for it, and the cohering is for it!

<BR>And all preparation is for it&amp;emdash;and identity is for it&amp;emdash;and

life

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and materials are altogether for it!

<P>O <FONT SIZE=-1>TAKE</FONT> my hand Walt Whitman!

<BR>Such gliding wonders! such sights and sounds!

<BR>Such join'd unended links, each hook'd to the next,

<BR>Each answering all, each sharing the earth with all.



<P>&nbsp;What widens within you Walt Whitman?

<BR>What waves and soils exuding?

<BR>What climes? what persons and cities are here?

<BR>Who are the infants, some playing, some slumbering?

<BR>Who are the girls? who are the married women?

<BR>Who are the groups of old men going slowly with their arms

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about each other's necks?

<BR>What rivers are these? what forests and fruits are these?

<BR>What are the mountains call'd that rise so high in the mists?

<BR>What myriads of dwellings are they fill'd with dwellers?

<P>Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens,

<BR>Asia, Africa, Europe, are to the east&amp;emdash;America is provided

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for in the west,

<BR>Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator,

<BR>Curiously north and south turn the axis-ends,

<BR>Within me is the longest day, the sun wheels in slanting rings,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it does not set for months,

<BR>Stretch'd in due time within me the midnight sun just rises

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; above the horizon and sinks again,

<BR>Within me zones, seas, cataracts, forests, volcanoes, groups,

<BR>Malaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands.

<P>What do you hear Walt Whitman?



<P>&nbsp;I hear the workman singing and the farmer's wife singing,

<BR>I hear in the distance the sounds of children and of animals

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; early in the day,

<BR>I hear emulous shouts of Australians pursuing the wild horse,

<BR>I hear the Spanish dance with castanets in the chestnut shade,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the rebeck and guitar,

<BR>I hear continual echoes from the Thames,

<BR>I hear fierce French liberty songs,

<BR>I hear of the Italian boat-sculler the musical recitative of old

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poems,

<BR>I hear the locusts in Syria as they strike the grain and grass

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the showers of their terrible clouds,

<BR>I hear the Coptic refrain toward sundown, pensively falling

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the breast of the black venerable vast

mother the Nile,

<BR>I hear the chirp of the Mexican muleteer, and the bells of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mule,

<BR>I hear the Arab muezzin calling from the top of the mosque,

<BR>I hear the Christian priests at the altars of their churches, I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hear the responsive base and soprano,

<BR>I hear the cry of the Cossack, and the sailor's voice putting to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sea at Okotsk,

<BR>I hear the wheeze of the slave-coffle as the slaves march on, as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the husky gangs pass on by twos and threes,

fasten'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; together with wrist-chains and ankle-chains,

<BR>I hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms,

<BR>I hear the rhythmic myths of the Greeks, and the strong

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; legends of the Romans,

<BR>I hear the tale of the divine life and bloody death of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beautiful God the Christ,

<BR>I hear the Hindoo teaching his favorite pupil the loves, wars,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adages, transmitted safely to this day from

poets who

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrote three thousand years ago.

<P>What do you see Walt Whitman?

<BR>Who are they you salute, and that one after another salute you?



<P>&nbsp;I see a great round wonder rolling through space,

<BR>I see diminute farms, hamlets, ruins, graveyards, jails, factories,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; palaces, hovels, huts of barbarians, tents

of nomads

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon the surface,

<BR>I see the shaded part on one side where the sleepers are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleeping, and the sunlit part on the other

side,

<BR>I see the curious rapid change of the light and shade,

<BR>I see distant lands, as real and near to the inhabitants of them

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as my land is to me.



<P>&nbsp;I see plenteous waters,

<BR>I see mountain peaks, I see the sierras of Andes where they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; range,

<BR>I see plainly the Himalayas, Chian Shahs, Altays, Ghauts,

<BR>I see the giant pinnacles of Elbruz, Kazbek, Bazardjusi,

<BR>I see the Styrian Alps, and the Karnac Alps,

<BR>I see the Pyrenees, Balks, Carpathians, and to the north the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dofrafields, and off at sea mount Hecla,

<BR>I see Vesuvius and Etna, the mountains of the Moon, and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red mountains of Madagascar,

<BR>I see the Lybian, Arabian, and Asiatic deserts,

<BR>I see huge dreadful Arctic and Antarctic icebergs,

<BR>I see the superior oceans and the interior ones, the Atlantic

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Pacific, the sea of Mexico, the Brazilian

sea, and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sea of Peru,

<BR>The waters of Hindustan, the China sea, and the gulf of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guinea,

<BR>The Japan waters, the beautiful bay of Nagasaki land-lock'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in its mountains,

<BR>The spread of the Baltic, Caspian, Bothnia, the British shores,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the bay of Biscay,

<BR>The clear-sunn'd Mediterranean, and from one to another of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its islands,

<BR>The White sea, and the sea around Greenland.



<P>&nbsp;I behold the mariners of the world,

<BR>Some are in storms, some in the night with the watch on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lookout,

<BR>Some drifting helplessly, some with contagious diseases.



<P>&nbsp;I behold the sail and steamships of the world, some in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clusters in port, some on their voyages,

<BR>Some double the cape of Storms, some cape Verde, others

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; capes Guardafui, Bon, or Bajadore,

<I>A Song of Joys</I></H1></CENTER>

O <FONT SIZE=-1>TO</FONT> make the most jubilant song!

<BR>Full of music&amp;emdash;full of manhood, womanhood, infancy!

<BR>Full of common employments&amp;emdash;full of grain and trees.



<P>&nbsp;O for the voices of animals&amp;emdash;O for the swiftness and

balance

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of fishes!

<BR>O for the dropping of raindrops in a song!

<BR>O for the sunshine and motion of waves in a song!



<P>&nbsp;O the joy of my spirit&amp;emdash;it is uncaged&amp;emdash;it

darts like

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lightning!

<BR>It is not enough to have this globe or a certain time,

<BR>I will have thousands of globes and all time.



<P>&nbsp;O the engineer's joys! to go with a locomotive!

<BR>To hear the hiss of steam, the merry shriek, the steam-whistle,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the laughing locomotive!

<BR>To push with resistless way and speed off in the distance.



<P>&nbsp;O the gleesome saunter over fields and hillsides!

<BR>The leaves and flowers of the commonest weeds, the moist fresh

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stillness of the woods,

<BR>The exquisite smell of the earth at daybreak, and all through

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the forenoon.



<P>&nbsp;O the horseman's and horsewoman's joys!

<BR>The saddle, the gallop, the pressure upon the seat, the cool

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gurgling by the ears and hair.



<P>&nbsp;O the fireman's joys!

<BR>I hear the alarm at dead of night,

<BR>I hear bells, shouts! I pass the crowd, I run!

<BR>The sight of the flames maddens me with pleasure.



<P>&nbsp;O the joy of the strong-brawn'd fighter, towering in the arena

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in perfect condition, conscious of power,

thirsting to meet

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his opponent.



<P>&nbsp;O the joy of that vast elemental sympathy which only the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; human soul is capable of generating and emitting

in steady

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and limitless floods.



<P>&nbsp;O the mother's joys!

<BR>The watching, the endurance, the precious love, the anguish,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the patiently yielded life.



<P>&nbsp;O the joy of increase, growth, recuperation,

<BR>The joy of soothing and pacifying, the joy of concord and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; harmony.



<P>&nbsp;O to go back to the place where I was born,

<BR>To hear the birds sing once more,

<BR>To ramble about the house and barn and over the fields

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; once more,

<BR>And through the orchard and along the old lanes once more.



<P>&nbsp;O to have been brought up on bays, lagoons, creeks, or along

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the coast,

<BR>To continue and be employ'd there all my life,

<BR>The briny and damp smell, the shore, the salt weeds exposed at

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; low water,

<BR>The work of fishermen, the work of the eel-fisher and clam-fisher;

<BR>I come with my clam-rake and spade, I come with my eel-spear,

<BR>Is the tide out? I join the group of clam-diggers on the flats,

<BR>I laugh and work with them, I joke at my work like a mettle-some

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; young man;

<BR>In winter I take my eel-basket and eel-spear and travel out on

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foot on the ice&amp;emdash;I have a small

axe to cut holes in the ice,



<P>&nbsp;Behold me well-clothed going gayly or returning in the afternoon,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my brood of tough boys accompanying me,

<BR>My brood of grown and part-grown boys, who love to be with no

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one else so well as they love to be with me,

<BR>By day to work with me, and by night to sleep with me.



<P>&nbsp;Another time in warm weather out in a boat, to lift the lobster-pots

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where they are sunk with heavy stones, (I

know the buoys,)

<BR>O the sweetness of the Fifth-month morning upon the water as I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; row just before sunrise toward the buoys,

<BR>I pull the wicker pots up slantingly, the dark green lobsters are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desperate with their claws as I take them

out, I insert wooden

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pegs in the joints of their pincers,

<BR>I go to all the places one after another, and then row back

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the shore,

<BR>There in a huge kettle of boiling water the lobsters shall be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boil'd till their color becomes scarlet.



<P>&nbsp;Another time mackerel-taking,

<BR>Voracious, mad for the hook, near the surface, they seem to fill

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the water for miles;

<BR>Another time fishing for rock-fish in Chesapeake Bay, I one of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the brown-faced crew;

<BR>Another time trailing for blue-fish off Paumanok, I stand with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; braced body,

<BR>My left foot is on the gunwale, my right arm throws far out the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coils of slender rope,

<BR>In sight around me the quick veering and darting of fifty skiffs,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my companions.



<P>&nbsp;O boating on the rivers,

<BR>The voyage down the St. Lawrence, the superb scenery, the steamers,

<BR>The ships sailing, the Thousand Islands, the occasional timber-raft

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the raftsmen with long-reaching sweepoars,

<BR>The little huts on the rafts, and the stream of smoke when they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cook supper at evening.



<P>&nbsp;(O something pernicious and dread!

<BR>Something far away from a puny and pious life!

<BR>Something unproved! something in a trance!

<BR>Something escaped from the anchorage and driving free.)



<P>&nbsp;O to work in mines, or forging iron,

<BR>Foundry casting, the foundry itself, the rude high roof, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ample and shadow'd space,

<BR>The furnace, the hot liquid pour'd out and running.



<P>&nbsp;O to resume the joys of the soldier!

<BR>To feel the presence of a brave commanding officer&amp;emdash;to feel

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his sympathy!

<BR>To behold his calmness&amp;emdash;to be warm'd in the rays of his smile!

<BR>To go to battle&amp;emdash;to hear the bugles play and the drums beat!

<BR>To hear the crash of artillery&amp;emdash;to see the glittering of

the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bayonets and musket-barrels in the sun!

<BR>To see men fall and die and not complain!

<BR>To taste the savage taste of blood&amp;emdash;to be so devilish!

<BR>To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy.



<P>&nbsp;O the whaleman's joys! O I cruise my old cruise again!

<BR>I feel the ship's motion under me, I feel the Atlantic breezes

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fanning me,

<BR>I hear the cry again sent down from the mast-head, <I>There</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash;she blows!</I>

<BR>Again I spring up the rigging to look with the rest&amp;emdash;we

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; descend, wild with excitement,

<BR>I leap in the lower'd boat, we row toward our prey where he lies,

<BR>We approach stealthy and silent, I see the mountainous mass,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lethargic, basking,

<BR>I see the harpooner standing up, I see the weapon dart from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his vigorous arm;

<BR>O swift again far out in the ocean the wounded whale, settling,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; running to windward, tows me,

<BR>Again I see him rise to breathe, we row close again,

<BR>I see a lance driven through his side, press'd deep, turn'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the wound,



<P>&nbsp;Again we back off, I see him settle again, the life is leaving

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him fast,

<BR>As he rises he spouts blood, I see him swim in circles narrower and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; narrower, swiftly cutting the water&amp;emdash;I

see him die,

<BR>He gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle, and then

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; falls flat and still in the bloody foam.



<P>&nbsp;O the old manhood of me, my noblest joy of all!

<BR>My children and grand-children, my white hair and beard,

<BR>My largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the long stretch of my life.



<P>&nbsp;O ripen'd joy of womanhood! O happiness at last!

<BR>I am more than eighty years of age, I am the most venerable mother,

<BR>How clear is my mind&amp;emdash;how all people draw night to me!

<BR>What attractions are these beyond any before? what bloom more

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the bloom of youth?

<BR>What beauty is this that descends upon me and rises out of me?



<P>&nbsp;O the orator's joys!

<BR>To inflate the chest, to roll the thunder of the voice out from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ribs and throat,

<BR>To make the people rage, weep, hate, desire, with yourself,

<BR>To lead America&amp;emdash;to quell America with a great tongue.



<P>&nbsp;O the joy of my soul leaning pois'd on itself, receiving

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identity through materials and loving them,

observing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; characters and absorbing them,

<BR>My soul vibrated back to me from them, from sight, hearing,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; touch, reason, articulation, comparison, memory,

and the like,

<BR>The real life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and flesh,

<BR>My body done with materials, my sight done with my material eyes,

<BR>Proved to me this day beyond cavil that it is not my material eyes

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which finally see,

<BR>Nor my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; embraces, procreates.



<P>&nbsp;O the farmer's joys!

<BR>Ohioan's, Illinoisian's, Wisconsinese', Kanadian's, Iowan's,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kansian's, Missourian's, Oregonese' joys!

<BR>To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work,

<BR>To plough land in the fall for winter-sown crops,

<BR>To plough land in the spring for maize,

<BR>To train orchards, to graft the trees, to gather apples in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the fall.



<P>&nbsp;O to bathe in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shore,

<BR>To splash the water! to walk ankle-deep, or race naked along

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the shore.



<P>&nbsp;O to realize space!

<BR>The plenteousness of all, that there are no bounds,

<BR>To emerge and be of the sky, of the sun and moon and flying

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clouds, as one with them.



<P>&nbsp;O the joy of a manly self-hood!

<BR>To be servile to none, to defer to none, not to any tyrant

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; known or unknown,

<BR>To walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic,

<BR>To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye,

<BR>To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest,

<BR>To confront with your personality all the other personalities of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the earth.



<P>&nbsp;Know'st thou the excellent joys of youth?

<BR>Joys of the dear companions and of the merry word and laughing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; face?

<BR>Joy of the glad light-beaming day, joy of the wide-breath'd games?

<BR>Joy of sweet music, joy of the lighted ball-room and the dancers?

<BR>Joy of the plenteous dinner, strong carouse and drinking?



<P>&nbsp;Yet O my soul supreme!

<BR>Know'st thou the joys of pensive thought?

<BR>Joys of the free and lonesome heart, the tender, gloomy heart?



<P>&nbsp;Joys of the solitary walk, the spirit bow'd yet proud, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffering and the struggle?

<BR>The agonistic throes, the ecstasies, joys of the solemn musings

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day or night?

<BR>Joys of the thought of Death, the great spheres Time and Space?

<BR>Prophetic joys of better, loftier love's ideals, the divine wife,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sweet, eternal, perfect comrade?

<BR>Joys all thine own undying one, joys worthy thee O soul.



<P>&nbsp;O while I live to be the ruler of life, not a slave,

<BR>To meet life as a powerful conqueror,

<BR>No fumes, no ennui, no more complaints or scornful criticisms,

<BR>To these proud laws of the air, the water and the ground,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proving my interior soul impregnable,

<BR>And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me.



<P>&nbsp;For not life's joys alone I sing, repeating&amp;emdash;the joy

of death!

<BR>The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moments, for reasons,

<BR>Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn'd, or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; render'd to powder, or buried,

<BR>My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres,

<BR>My voided body nothing more to me, returning to the purifications,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further offices, eternal uses of the earth.



<P>&nbsp;O to attract by more than attraction!

<BR>How it is I know not&amp;emdash;yet behold! the something which

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obeys none of the rest,

<BR>It is offensive, never defensive&amp;emdash;yet how magnetic it draws.



<P>&nbsp;O to struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted!

<BR>To be entirely alone with them, to find how much one can stand!

<BR>To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, face to face!

<BR>To mount the scaffold, to advance to the muzzles of guns

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with perfect nonchalance!

<BR>To be indeed a God!



<P>&nbsp;O to sail to sea in a ship!

<BR>To leave this steady unendurable land,

<BR>To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the houses,

<BR>To leave you O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship,

<BR>To sail and sail and sail!



<P>&nbsp;O to have life henceforth a poem of new joys!

<BR>To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on!

<BR>To be a sailor of the world bound for all ports,

<BR>A ship itself, (see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air,)

<BR>A swift and swelling ship full of rich words, full of joys.

T<FONT SIZE=-1>hou</FONT> Mother with thy equal brood,

<BR>Thou varied chain of different States, yet one identity only,

<BR>A special song before I go I'd sing o'er all the rest,

<BR>For thee, the future.



<P>&nbsp;I'd sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality,

<BR>I'd fashion thy ensemble including body and soul,

<BR>I'd show away ahead thy real Union, and how it may be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accomplish'd.



<P>&nbsp;The paths to the house I seek to make,

<BR>But leave to those to come the house itself.



<P>&nbsp;Belief I sing, and preparation;

<BR>As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; present only,

<BR>But greater still from what is yet to come,

<BR>Out of that formula for thee I sing.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>2</CENTER>

As a strong bird on pinions free,

<BR>Joyous, the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving,

<BR>Such be the thought I'd think of thee America,

<BR>Such be the recitative I'd bring for thee.



<P>&nbsp;The conceits of the poets of other lands I'd bring thee not,

<BR>Nor the compliments that have served their turn so long,

<BR>Nor rhyme, nor the classics, nor perfume of foreign court or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indoor library;

<BR>But an odor I'd bring as from forests of pine in Maine, or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breath of an Illinois prairie,

<BR>With open airs of Virginia or Georgia or Tennessee, or from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Texas uplands, or Florida's glades,

<BR>Or the Saguenay's black stream, or the wide blue spread of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Huron,

<BR>With presentment of Yellowstone's scenes, or Yosemite,

<BR>And murmuring under, pervading all, I'd bring the rustling

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sea-sound,

<BR>That endlessly sounds from the two Great Seas of the world.



<P>&nbsp;And for thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother,

<BR>Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee, mind-formulas

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fitted for thee, real and sane and large as these

and thee,

<BR>Thou! mounting higher, diving deeper than we knew, thou

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transcendental Union!

<BR>By thee fact to be justified, blended with thought,

<BR>Thought of man justified, blended with God,

<BR>Through thy idea, lo, the immortal reality!

<BR>Through thy reality, lo, the immortal ideal!

Brain of the New World, what a task is thine,

<BR>To formulate the Modern&amp;emdash;out of the peerless grandeur of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the modern,

<BR>Out of thyself, comprising science, to recast poems, churches,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; art,

<BR>(Recast, maybe discard them, end them&amp;emdash;maybe their work

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is done, who knows?)

<BR>By vision, hand, conception, on the background of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mighty past, the dead,

<BR>To limn with absolute faith the mighty living present.



<P>&nbsp;And yet thou living present brain, heir of the dead, the Old

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; World brain,

<BR>Thou that lay folded like an unborn babe within its fold so

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long,

<BR>Thou carefully prepared by it so long&amp;emdash;haply thou but

<P>&nbsp;It to eventuate in thee&amp;emdash;the essence of the by-gone

time

<BR>Of value is thy freight, 'tis not the Present only,

<BR>The Past is also stored in thee,

<BR>Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone, not of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Western continent alone,

Beautiful world of new superber birth that rises to my eyes,

<BR>Like a limitless golden cloud filling the western sky,

<BR>Emblem of general maternity lifted above all,

<BR>Out of thy teeming womb thy giant babes in ceaseless

<BR>Acceding from such gestation, taking and giving continual

<BR>World of the real&amp;emdash;world of the twain in one,

<BR>World of the soul, born by the world of the real alone, led to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the past,

<BR>I see thy light lighting, and thy shadow shadowing, as if the

<BR>But I do not undertake to define thee, hardly to comprehend

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thee,

<BR>I but thee name, thee prophesy, as now,

<BR>I merely thee ejaculate!

<BR>Thee in thy future,

<BR>Thee in thy only permanent life, career, thy own unloosen'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mind, thy soaring spirit,

<BR>Thee as another equally needed sun, radiant, ablaze, swift-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moving, fructifying all,

<BR>Thee risen in potent cheerfulness and joy, in endless great

<BR>Scattering for good the cloud that hung so long, that weigh'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so long upon the mind of man,

<BR>The doubt, suspicion, dread, of gradual, certain decadence of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man;

<BR>Thee in thy larger, saner brood of female, male&amp;emdash;thee in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; East,

<BR>(To thy immortal breasts, Mother of All, thy every daughter,

<BR>Thee in thy own musicians, singers, artists, unborn yet, but

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certain,

<BR>Thee in thy moral wealth and civilization, (until which thy

<BR>Thee in thy all-supplying, all-enclosing worship&amp;emdash;thee in

no

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incessant within thyself, equal to any, divine as

any,

<BR>(Thy soaring course thee formulating, not in thy two great

<BR>But far more in these leaves and chants, thy chants, great

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother!)

<BR>Thee in an education grown of thee, in teachers, studies,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; students, born of thee,

<BR>Thee in thy democratic f&ccedil;etes en-masse, thy high original

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; festivals, operas, lecturers, preachers,

<BR>Thee in thy ultimata, (the preparations only now completed,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the edifice on sure foundations tied,)

<BR>Thee in thy pinnacles, intellect, thought, thy topmost rational

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; joys, thy love and godlike aspiration,

<BR>In thy resplendent coming literati, thy full-lung'd orators,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thy sacerdotal bards, kosmic savans,

<BR>These! these in thee, (certain to come,) to-day I prophesy.

<BR>Open'd by thee to heaven's light for benefit or bale.



<P>&nbsp;Not for success alone,

<BR>Not to fair-sail unintermitted always,

<BR>For the tug and mortal strain of nations come at last in

<BR>In many a smiling mask death shall approach beguiling thee,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thou in disease shalt swelter,

<BR>The livid cancer spread its hideous claws, clinging upon thy

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breasts, seeking to strike thee deep within,

<BR>Consumption of the worst, moral consumption, shall rouge

<BR>By many a throe of heat and cold convuls'd, (by these thyself

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; solidifying,)

<BR>Thou mental, moral orb&amp;emdash;thou New, indeed new, Spiritual

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; World!

Two boats with nets lying off the sea-beach, quite still,

<BR>Ten fishermen waiting&amp;emdash;they discover a thick school of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mossbonkers&amp;emdash;they drop the join'd seine-ends

in the water,

<BR>The boats separate and row off, each on its rounding course

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the beach, enclosing the mossbonkers,

<BR>The net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop ashore,

<BR>Some of the fishermen lounge in their boats, others stand

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ankle-deep in the water, pois'd on strong legs,

<BR>The boats partly drawn up, the water slapping against them,

<BR>Strew'd on the sand in heaps and windrows, well out from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the water, the green-back'd spotted mossbonkers.

<CENTER>FIRST O SONGS FOR A PRELUDE</CENTER>



<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>



<CENTER></CENTER>

F<FONT SIZE=-1>irst</FONT> O songs for a prelude,

<BR>Lightly strike on the stretch'd tympanum pride and joy in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my city,

<BR>How she led the rest to arms, how she gave the cue,

<BR>How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang,

<BR>(O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless!

<BR>O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than steel!)

<BR>How you sprang&amp;emdash;how you threw off the costumes of peace

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with indifferent hand,

<BR>How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were heard in their stead,

<BR>How you led to the war, (that shall serve for our prelude,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; songs of soldiers,)

<BR>How Manhattan drum-taps led.



<P>&nbsp;Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading,

<BR>Forty years as a pageant, till unawares the lady of this

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; teeming and turbulent city,

<BR>Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,

<BR>With her million children around her, suddenly,

<BR>At dead of night, at news from the south,

<BR>Incens'd struck with clinch'd hand the pavement.



<P>&nbsp;A shock electric, the night sustain'd it,

<BR>Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour'd out its

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myriads.



<P>&nbsp;From the houses then and the workshops, and through all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the doorways,

<BR>Leapt they tumultuous, and lo! Manhattan arming.



<P>&nbsp;To the drum-taps prompt,

<BR>The young men falling in and arming,

<BR>The mechanics arming, (the trowel, the jack-plane, the blacksmith's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hammer, tost aside with precipitation,)

<BR>The lawyer leaving his office and arming, the judge leaving

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the court,

<BR>The driver deserting his wagon in the street, jumping down,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throwing the reins abruptly down on the horses'

backs,

<BR>The salesman leaving the store, the boss, book-keeper,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; porter, all leaving;

<BR>Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm,

<BR>The new recruits, even boys, the old men show them how to wear

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their accoutrements, they buckle the straps

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carefully,

<BR>Outdoors, arming, indoors arming, the flash of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; musketbarrels,

<BR>The white tents cluster in camps, the arm'd sentries around,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sunrise cannon and again at sunset,

<BR>Arm'd regiments arrive every day, pass through the city,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and embark from the wharves,

<BR>(How good they look as they tramp down to the river, sweaty,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with their guns on their shoulders!

<BR>How I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; faces and their clothes and knapsacks cover'd

with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dust!)

<BR>The blood of the city up&amp;emdash;arm'd! arm'd! the cry everywhere,

<BR>The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the public buildings and stores,

<BR>The tearful parting, the mother kisses her son, the son kisses

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his mother,

<BR>(Loth is the mother to part, yet not a word does she speak to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detain him,)

<BR>The tumultuous escort, the ranks of policemen preceding,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearing the way,

<BR>The unpent enthusiasm, the wild cheers of the crowd for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their favorites,

<BR>The artillery, the silent cannons bright as gold, drawn along,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rumble lightly over the stones,

<BR>(Silent cannons, soon to cease your silence,

<BR>Soon unlimber'd to begin the red business;)



<P>&nbsp;All the mutter of preparation, all the determin'd arming,

<BR>The hospital service, the lint, bandages and medicines,

<BR>The women volunteering for nurses, the work begun for in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earnest, no mere parade now;

<BR>War! an arm'd race is advancing! the welcome for battle, no

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turning away;

<BR>War! be it weeks, months, or years, an arm'd race is advancing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to welcome it.



<P>&nbsp;Mannahatta a-march&amp;emdash;and it's O to sing it well!

<BR>It's O for a manly life in the camp.



<P>&nbsp;And the sturdy artillery,

<BR>The guns bright as gold, the work for giants, to serve well the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guns,

<BR>Unlimber them! (no more as the past forty years for salute or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; courtesies merely,

<BR>Put in something now besides powder and wadding.)



<P>&nbsp;And you lady of ships, you Mannahatta,

<BR>Old matron of this proud, friendly, turbulent city,

<BR>Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amid all your children,

<BR>But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta.

A<FONT SIZE=-1>rm'd</FONT> year&amp;emdash;year of the struggle,

<BR>Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending

<BR>Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipp'd

<CENTER>SONG OF THE BANNER AT DAYBREAK</CENTER>



<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>Poet</I></CENTER>

O A new song, a free song,

<BR>Flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by voices

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearer,

<BR>By the wind's voice and that of the drum,

<BR>By the banner's voice and child's voice and sea's voice and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; father's voice,

<BR>Low on the ground and high in the air,

<BR>On the ground where father and child stand,

<BR>In the upward air where their eyes turn,

<BR>Where the banner at daybreak is flapping.



<P>&nbsp;Words! book-words! what are you?

<BR>Words no more, for hearken and see,

<BR>My song is there in the open air, and I must sing,

<BR>With the banner and pennant a-flapping.



<P>&nbsp;I'll weave the chord and twine in,

<BR>Man's desire and babe's desire, I'll twine them in, I'll put in

<BR>life,

<BR>I'll put the bayonet's flashing point, I'll let bullets and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slugs whizz,

<BR>(As one carrying a symbol and menace far into the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; future,

<BR>Crying with trumpet voice, <I>Arouse and beware! Beware and</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arouse</I>!)

<BR>I'll pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of joy,

<BR>Then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,

<BR>With the banner and pennant a-flapping.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>Pennant</I></CENTER>

Come up here, bard, bard,

<BR>Come up here, soul, soul,

<BR>Come up here, dear little child,

<BR>To fly in the clouds and winds with me, and play with the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; measureless light.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>Child</I></CENTER>

Father what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finger?

<BR>And what does it say to me all the while?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>Father</I></CENTER>

Nothing my babe you see in the sky,

<BR>And nothing at all to you it says&amp;emdash;but look you my babe,

<BR>Look at these dazzling things in the houses, and see you the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; money-shops opening,

<BR>And see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with goods;

<BR>These, ah these, how valued and toil'd for these!

<BR>How envied by all the earth!



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>Poet</I></CENTER>

Fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high,

<BR>On floats the sea in distant blue careering through its

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; channels,

<BR>On floats the wind over the breast of the sea setting in toward

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; land,

<BR>The great steady wind from west or west-by-south,

<BR>Floating so buoyant with milk-white foam on the waters.



<P>&nbsp;But I am not the sea nor the red sun,

<BR>I am not the wind with girlish laughter,

<BR>Not the immense wind which strengthens, not the wind

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which lashes,

<BR>Not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; death,

<BR>But I am that which unseen comes and sings, sings, sings,

<BR>Which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land,

<BR>Which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings,

<BR>And the shore-sands know and the hissing wave, and that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; banner and pennant,

<BR>Aloft there flapping and flapping.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>Child</I></CENTER>

O father it is alive&amp;emdash;it is full of people&amp;emdash;it has

children,

<BR>O now it seems to me it is talking to its children,

<BR>I hear it&amp;emdash;it talks to me&amp;emdash;O it is wonderful!

<BR>O it stretches&amp;emdash;it spreads and runs so fast&amp;emdash;O

my father,

<BR>It is so broad it covers the whole sky.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>Father</I></CENTER>

Cease, cease, my foolish babe,

<BR>What you are saying is sorrowful to me, much it displeases

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me;

<BR>Behold with the rest again I say, behold not banners and pennants aloft,

<BR>But the well-prepared pavements behold, and mark the solid-wall'd houses.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><I>Banner and Pennant</I></CENTER>

Speak to the child O bard out of Manhattan,

<BR>To our children all, or north or south of Manhattan,

<BR>Point this day, leaving all the rest, to us over all&amp;emdash;and

yet we

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know not why,

<BR>For what are we, mere strips of cloth profiting nothing,

<BR>Only flapping in the wind?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>Poet</I></CENTER>

I hear and see not strips of cloth alone,

<BR>I hear the tramp of armies, I hear the challenging sentry,

<BR>I hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men, I hear Liberty!

<BR>I hear the drums beat and the trumpets blowing,

<BR>I myself move abroad swift-rising flying then,

<BR>I use the wings of the land-bird and use the wings of the sea-bird,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and look down as from a height,

<BR>I do not deny the precious results of peace, I see populous

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cities with wealth incalculable,

<BR>I see numberless farms, I see the farmers working in their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fields or barns,

<BR>I see mechanics working, I see buildings everywhere founded,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going up, or finish'd,

<BR>I see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drawn by the locomotives,

<BR>I see the stores, depots, of Boston, Baltimore, Charleston,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Orleans,

<BR>I see far in the West the immense area of grain, I dwell awhile

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hovering,



<P>&nbsp;I pass to the lumber forests of the North, and again to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Southern plantation, and again to California;

<BR>Sweeping the whole I see the countless profit, the busy

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gatherings, earn'd wages,

<BR>See the Identity formed out of thirty-eight spacious and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; haughty States, (and many more to come,)

<BR>See forts on the shores of harbors, see ships sailing in and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out;

<BR>Then over all, (aye! aye!) my little and lengthen'd pennant

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shaped like a sword,

<BR>Runs swiftly up indicating war and defiance&amp;emdash;and now the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; halyards have rais'd it,

<BR>Side of my banner broad and blue, side of my starry

<BR>banner,

<BR>Discarding peace over all the sea and land.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>Banner and Pennant</I></CENTER>

Yet louder, higher, stronger, bard! yet farther, wider cleave!

<BR>No longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone,

<BR>We may be terror and carnage, and are so now,

<BR>Not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; States, (nor any five, nor ten,)

<BR>Nor market nor depot we, nor money-bank in the city,

<BR>But these and all, and the brown and spreading land, and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mines below, are ours,

<BR>And the shores of the sea are ours, and the rivers great and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; small,

<BR>And the fields they moisten, and the crops and the fruits are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ours,

<BR>Bays and channels and ships sailing in and out are ours&amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while we over all,

<BR>Over the area spread below, the three or four millions of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; square miles, the capitals,

<BR>The forty millions of people,&amp;emdash;O bard! in life and death

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; supreme,

<BR>We, even we, henceforth flaunt out masterful, high up above,

<BR>Not for the present alone, for a thousand years chanting

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through you,

<BR>This song to the soul of one poor little child.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>Child</I></CENTER>

O my father I like not the houses,

<BR>They will never to me be anything, nor do I like money,

<BR>But to mount up there I would like, O father dear, that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; banner I like,

<BR>That pennant I would be and must be.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>Father</I></CENTER>

Child of mine you fill me with anguish,

<BR>To be that pennant would be too fearful,

<BR>Little you know what it is this day, and after this day, forever,

<BR>It is to gain nothing, but risk and defy everything,

<BR>Forward to stand in front of wars&amp;emdash;and O, such wars!&amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what have you to do with them?

<BR>With passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>Banner</I></CENTER>

Demons and death then I sing,

<BR>Put in all, aye all will I, sword-shaped pennant for war,

<BR>And a pleasure new and ecstatic, and the prattled yearning of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; children,

<BR>Blent with the sounds of the peaceful land and the liquid

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wash of the sea,

<BR>And the black ships fighting on the sea envelop'd in smoke,

<BR>And the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling cedars

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and pines,

<BR>And the whirr of drums and the sound of soldiers marching,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the hot sun shining south,

<BR>And the beach-waves combing over the beach on my Eastern shore,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my Western shore the same,

<BR>And all between those shores, and my ever running Mississippi

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with bends and chutes,

<BR>And my Illinois fields, and my Kansas fields, and my fields of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Missouri,

<BR>The Continent, devoting the whole identity without reserving

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an atom,

<BR>Pour in! whelm that which asks, which sings, with all and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yield of all,



<P>&nbsp;Fusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole,

<BR>No more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,

<BR>But out of the night emerging for good, our voice persuasive

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no more,

<BR>Croaking like crows here in the wind.

<CENTER><I>Poet</I></CENTER>

My limbs, my veins dilate, my theme is clear at last,

<BR>Banner so broad advancing out of the night, I sing you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; haughty and resolute,

<BR>I burst through where I waited long, too long, deafen'd and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blinded,

<BR>My hearing and tongue are come to me, (a little child taught

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,)

<BR>I hear from above O pennant of war your ironical call and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; demand,

<BR>Insensate! insensate (yet I at any rate chant you,) O banner!

<BR>Not houses of peace indeed are you, nor any nor all their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prosperity, (if need be, you shall again have

every one of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those houses to destroy them,

<BR>You thought not to destroy those valuable houses, standing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fast, full of comfort, built with money,

<BR>May they stand fast, then? not an hour except you above

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them and all stand fast;)

<BR>O banner, not money so precious are you, not farm produce you,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor the material good nutriment,

<BR>Nor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the ships,

<BR>Not the superb ships with sail-power or steam-power, fetching and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carrying cargoes,

<BR>Nor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues&amp;emdash;but you as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; henceforth I see you,

<BR>Running up out of the night, bringing your cluster of stars,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ever-enlarging stars,)

<BR>Divider of daybreak you, cutting the air, touch'd by the sun,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; measuring the sky,

<BR>(Passionately seen and yearn'd for by one poor little child,

<BR>While others remain busy or smartly talking, forever teaching

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thrift, thrift;)



<P>&nbsp;O you up there! O pennant! where you undulate like a snake

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hissing so curious,

<BR>Out of reach, an idea only, yet furiously fought for, risking

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bloody death, loved by me,

<BR>So loved&amp;emdash;O you banner leading the day with stars brought

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the night!

<BR>Valueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding all&amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (absolute owner of all)&amp;emdash;O banner and

pennant!

<BR>I too leave the rest&amp;emdash;great as it is, it is nothing&amp;emdash;houses,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machines are nothing&amp;emdash;I see them

not,

<BR>I see but you, O warlike pennant! O banner so broad, with stripes,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sing you only,

<BR>Flapping up there in the wind.

R<FONT SIZE=-1>ise</FONT> O days from your fathomless deeps, till you loftier,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fiercer sweep,

<BR>Long for my soul hungering gymnastic I devour'd what the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth gave me,

<BR>Long I roam'd the woods of the north, long I watch'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Niagara pouring,

<BR>I travel'd the prairies over and slept on their breast, I cross'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Nevadas, I cross'd the plateaus,

<BR>I ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific, I sail'd out

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to sea,

<BR>I sail'd through the storm, I was refresh'd by the storm,

<BR>I watch'd with joy the threatening maws of the waves,

<BR>I mark'd the white combs where they career'd so high, curling

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over,

<BR>I heard the wind piping, I saw the black clouds,

<BR>Saw from below what arose and mounted, (O superb! O

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wild as my heart, and powerful!)

<BR>Heard the continuous thunder as it bellow'd after the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lightning,

<BR>Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fast amid the din they chased each other

across the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sky;

<BR>These, and such as these, I, elate, saw&amp;emdash;saw with wonder,

yet

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pensive and masterful,

<BR>All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me,

<BR>Yet there with my soul I fed, I fed content, supercilious.



<P>&nbsp;

'Twas well, O soul&amp;emdash;'twas a good preparation you gave me,

<BR>Now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill,

<BR>Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gave us,

<BR>Not through the mighty woods we go, but through the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mightier cities,

<BR>Something for us is pouring now more than Niagara pouring,

<BR>Torrents of men, (sources and rills of the Northwest are you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indeed inexhaustible?)

<BR>What, to pavements and homesteads here, what were those

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; storms of the mountains and sea?

<BR>What, to passions I witness around me to-day? was the sea

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; risen?

<BR>Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?

<BR>Lo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and savage,

<BR>Manhattan rising, advancing with menacing front&amp;emdash;Cincinnati,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chicago, unchain'd;

<BR>What was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here,

<BR>How it climbs with daring feet and hands&amp;emdash;how it dashes!

<BR>How the true thunder bellows after the lightning&amp;emdash;how

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bright the flashes of lightning!

<BR>How Democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shown through the dark by those flashes of

lightning!

<BR>(Yet a mournful wail and low sob I fancied I heard through

<BR>the dark,

<BR>In a lull of the deafening confusion.)



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>3</CENTER>

Thunder on! stride on, Democracy! strike with vengeful

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stroke!

<BR>And do you rise higher than ever yet O days, O cities!

<BR>Crash heavier, heavier yet O storms! you have done me

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good,

<BR>My soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong nutriment,

<BR>Long had I walk'd my cities, my country roads through

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; farms, only half satisfied,

<BR>One doubt nauseous undulating like a snake, crawl'd on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ground before me,

<BR>Continually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hissing low;

<BR>The cities I love so well I abandon'd and left, I sped to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certainties suitable to me,

<BR>Hungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature's dauntlessness,

<BR>I refresh'd myself with it only, I could relish it only,

<BR>I waited the bursting forth of the pent fire&amp;emdash;on the water

and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; air I waited long;

<BR>But now I no longer wait, I am fully satisfied, I am glutted,

<BR>I have witness'd the true lightning, I have witness'd my cities

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electric,

<BR>I have lived to behold man burst forth and warlike America

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rise,

<BR>Hence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wilds,

<BR>No more the mountains roam or sail the stormy sea.

I have adopted,

do not condemn anything,

<BR>I chant and celebrate all that is yours&amp;emdash;yet peace no more,

<BR>In peace I chanted peace, but now the drum of war is mine,

<BR>War, red war is my song through your streets, O city!

<CENTER>THE CENTENARIAN'S STORY</CENTER>



<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>Volunteer of</I> 1861-2, (<I>at Washington Park, Brooklyn, assisting

the Centenarian</I>)</CENTER>

G<FONT SIZE=-1>ive</FONT> me your hand old Revolutionary,

<BR>The hill-top is nigh, but a few steps, (make room

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gentlemen,)

<BR>Up the path you have follow'd me well, spite of your hundred and extra

years,

<BR>You can walk old man, though your eyes are almost done,

<BR>Your faculties serve you, and presently I must have them

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serve me.



<P>&nbsp;Rest, while I tell what the crowd around us means,

<BR>On the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising,

<BR>There is the camp, one regiment departs to-morrow,

<BR>Do you hear the officers giving their orders?

<BR>Do you hear the clank of the muskets?



<P>&nbsp;Why what comes over you now old man?

<BR>Why do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively?

<BR>The troops are but drilling, they are yet surrounded with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smiles,

<BR>Around them at hand the well-drest friends and the women,

<BR>While splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down,

<BR>Green the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breeze,

<BR>O'er proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between.



<P>&nbsp;But drill and parade are over, they march back to quarters,

<BR>Only hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping!



<P>&nbsp;As wending the crowds now part and disperse&amp;emdash;but we

old

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man,

<BR>Not for nothing have I brought you hither&amp;emdash;we must remain,

<BR>You to speak in your turn, and I to listen and tell.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>The Centenarian</I></CENTER>

When I clutch'd your hand it was not with terror,

<BR>But suddenly pouring about me here on every side,

<BR>And below there where the boys were drilling, and up the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slopes they ran,

<BR>And where tents are pitch'd, and wherever you see south and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; south-east and south-west,

<BR>Over hills, across lowlands and in the skirts of woods,

<BR>And along the shores in mire (now fill'd over) came again

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and suddenly raged,



<P>&nbsp;As eighty-five years a-gone no mere parade receiv'd with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; applause of friends,

<BR>But a battle which I took part in myself&amp;emdash;aye, long ago as

it is,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took part in it,

<BR>Walking then this hilltop, this same ground.



<P>&nbsp;Aye, this is the ground,

<BR>My blind eyes even as I speak behold it re-peopled from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; graves,

<BR>The years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear,

<BR>Rude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns are mounted,

<BR>I see the lines of rais'd earth stretching from river to bay,

<BR>I mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;

<BR>Here we lay encamp'd, it was this time in summer also.



<P>&nbsp;As I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration,

<BR>It was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; here,

<BR>By his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he held up his unsheath'd sword,

<BR>It glitter'd in the sun in full sight of the army.



<P>&nbsp;'Twas a bold act then&amp;emdash;the English war-ships had just

arrived,

<BR>We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anchor,

<BR>And the transports swarming with soldiers.



<P>&nbsp;A few days more and they landed and then the battle.



<P>&nbsp;Twenty thousand were brought against us,

<BR>A veteran force furnish'd with good artillery.



<P>&nbsp;I tell not now the whole of the battle,

<BR>But one brigade early in the forenoon order'd forward to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; engage the red-coats,

<BR>Of that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march'd,

<BR>And how long and well it stood confronting death.



<P>&nbsp;Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confronting death?

<BR>It was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,

<BR>Rais'd in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; personally to the General.



<P>&nbsp;Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus'

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waters,

<BR>Till of a sudden unlook'd for by defiles through the woods,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gain'd at night,

<BR>The British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; playing their guns,

<BR>That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mercy.



<P>&nbsp;The General watch'd them from this hill,

<BR>They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; environment,

<BR>Then drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the middle,

<BR>But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thinning them!



<P>&nbsp;It sickens me yet, that slaughter!

<BR>I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General.

<BR>I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.



<P>&nbsp;Meanwhile the British manoeuvr'd to draw us out for a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pitch'd battle,

<BR>But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch'd battle.



<P>&nbsp;We fought the fight in detachments,

<BR>Sallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; luck was against us,

<BR>Our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push'd us

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back to the works on this hill,

<BR>Till we turn'd menacing here, and then he left us.



<P>&nbsp;That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two thousand strong,

<BR>Few return'd, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.



<P>&nbsp;That and here my General's first battle,

<BR>No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conclude with applause,

<BR>Nobody clapp'd hands here then.



<P>&nbsp;But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,

<BR>Wearied that night we lay foil'd and sullen,

<BR>While scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord off against

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us encamp'd,

<BR>Quite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over their victory.



<P>&nbsp;So dull and damp and another day,

<BR>But the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,

<BR>Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my General retreated.



<P>&nbsp;I saw him at the river-side,

<BR>Down by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;

<BR>My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pass'd over,

<BR>And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the last time.



<P>&nbsp;Every one else seem'd fill'd with gloom,

<BR>Many no doubt thought of capitulation.



<P>&nbsp;But when my General pass'd me,

<BR>As he stood in his boat and look'd toward the coming sun,

<BR>I saw something different from capitulation.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><I>Terminus</I></CENTER>

Enough, the Centenarian's story ends,

<BR>The two, the past and present, have interchanged,

<BR>I myself as connecter, a chansonnier of a great future, am

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now speaking.



<P>&nbsp;And is this the ground Washington trod?

<BR>And these waters I listlessly daily cross, are these the waters

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he cross'd,



<P>&nbsp;As resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; triumphs?



<P>&nbsp;I must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward,

<BR>I must preserve that look as it beam'd on you rivers of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brooklyn.



<P>&nbsp;See&amp;emdash;as the annual round returns the phantoms return,

<BR>It is the 27th of August and the British have landed,

<BR>The battle begins and goes against us, behold through the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smoke Washington's face,

<BR>The brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march'd forth to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intercept the enemy,

<BR>They are cut off, murderous artillery from the hills plays

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon them,

<BR>Rank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flag,

<BR>Baptized that day in many a young man's bloody wounds,

<BR>In death, defeat, and sisters', mothers' tears.



<P>&nbsp;Ah, hills and slopes of Brooklyn! I perceive you are more

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; valuable than your owners supposed;

<BR>In the midst of you stands an encampment very old,

<BR>Stands forever the camp of that dead brigade.

<CENTER>COME UP FROM THE FIELDS FATHER</CENTER>

C<FONT SIZE=-1>ome</FONT> up from the fields father, here's a letter from

our Pete,

<BR>And come to the front door mother, here's a letter from thy

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dear son.



<P>&nbsp;Lo, 'tis autumn,

<BR>Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,

<BR>Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages with leaves fluttering in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moderate wind,

<BR>Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trellis'd vines,

<BR>(Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?

<BR>Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?)



<P>&nbsp;Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with wondrous clouds,

<BR>Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prospers well.



<P>&nbsp;Down in the fields all prospers well,

<BR>But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call,

<BR>And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; away.



<P>&nbsp;Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trembling,

<BR>She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.



<P>&nbsp;Open the envelope quickly,

<BR>O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd,



<P>&nbsp;O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soul!

<BR>All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main words only,

<BR>Sentences broken, <I>gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skirmish, taken to hospital</I>,

<BR><I>At present low, but will soon be better</I>.



<P>&nbsp;Ah now the single figure to me,

<BR>Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; farms,

<BR>Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,

<BR>By the jamb of a door leans.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Grieve not so, dear mother</I>, (the just-grown daughter speaks

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through her sobs,

<BR>The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay'd,)

<BR><I>See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better</I>.



<P>&nbsp;Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be better, that brave and simple soul,)

<BR>While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,

<BR>The only son is dead.



<P>&nbsp;But the mother needs to be better,

<BR>She with thin form presently drest in black,

<BR>By day her meals untouch'd, then at night fitfully sleeping,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; often walking,

<BR>In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longing,

<BR>O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and withdraw,

<BR>To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.

<CENTER>VIGIL STRANGE I KEPT ON THE FIELD ONE NIGHT</CENTER>

V<FONT SIZE=-1>igil</FONT> strange I kept on the field one night;

<BR>When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day,

<BR>One look I but gave which your dear eyes return'd with a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look I shall never forget,

<BR>One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach'd up as you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lay on the ground,

<BR>Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,

<BR>Till late in the night reliev'd to the place at last again I made

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my way,

<BR>Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; son of responding kisses, (never again on earth

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; responding,)

<BR>Bared your face in the stralight, curious the scene, cool blew

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the moderate night-wind,

<BR>Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; battlefield spreading,

<BR>Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; night,

<BR>But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gazed,

<BR>Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my chin in my hands,

<BR>Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comrade&amp;emdash;

<BR>not a tear, not a word, Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for

you my son and my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soldier,

<BR>As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stole,

<BR>Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your death,

<BR>I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall surely meet again,)

<BR>Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appear'd,

<BR>My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; form,

<BR>Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carefully under feet,

<BR>And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited,

<BR>Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dim,



<P>&nbsp;Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; responding,)

<BR>Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day brighten'd,

<BR>I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blanket,

<BR>And buried him where he fell.

<CENTER>A MARCH IN THE RANKS HARD-PREST, AND THE ROAD UNKNOWN</CENTER>

A <FONT SIZE=-1>march</FONT> in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,

<BR>A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; darkness,

<BR>Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; retreating,

<BR>Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dimlighted building,

<BR>We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dim-lighted building,

<BR>'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; impromptu hospital,

<BR>Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and poems ever made,

<BR>Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and lamps,

<BR>And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and clouds of smoke,

<BR>By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some in the pews laid down,

<BR>At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)

<BR>I stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster's face is white

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a lily,)

<BR>Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; absorb it all,

<BR>Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obscurity, some of them dead,

<BR>Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the odor of blood,

<BR>The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outside also fill'd,

<BR>Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some in the death-spasm sweating,

<BR>An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calls,

<BR>The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the torches,

<BR>These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; odor,

<BR>Then hear outside the orders given, <I>Fall in, my men, fall in</I>;

<BR>But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gives he me,

<BR>Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; darkness,

<BR>Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ranks,

<BR>The unknown road still marching.

<CENTER><B>A SIGHT IN CAMP IN THE DAYBREAK GRAY AND DIM</B></CENTER>

A <FONT SIZE=-1>sight</FONT> in camp in the daybreak gray and dim,

<BR>As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless,

<BR>As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hospital tent,

<BR>Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untended lying,

<BR>Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woolen blanket,

<BR>Gray and heavy blanket, folding, covering all.



<P>&nbsp;Curious I halt and silent stand,

<BR>Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just lift the blanket;

<BR>Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-gray'd hair,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and flesh all sunken about the eyes?

<BR>Who are you my dear comrade?



<P>&nbsp;Then to the second I step&amp;emdash;and who are you my child

and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; darling?

<CENTER><B>AS TOILSOME I WANDER'D VIRGINIA'S WOODS</B></CENTER>

As toilsome I wander'd Virginia's woods,

<BR>To the music of rustling leaves kick'd by my feet, (for 'twas

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; autumn,)

<BR>I mark'd at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier;

<BR>Mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat, (easily all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could I understand,)

<BR>The halt of a mid-day hour, when up! no time to lose&amp;emdash;yet

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this sign left,

<BR>On a tablet scrawl'd and nail'd on the tree by the grave,

<BR><I>Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade</I>.



<P>&nbsp;Long, long I muse, then on my way go wandering,

<BR>Many a changeful season to follow, and many a scene of life,

<BR>Yet at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alone, or in the crowded street,

<BR>Comes before me the unknown soldier's grave, comes the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inscription rude in Virginia's woods,

<BR><I>Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade</I>.

A<FONT SIZE=-1>n</FONT> old man bending I come among new faces,

<BR>Years looking backward resuming in answer to children,

<BR>Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love me,

<BR>(Arous'd and angry, I'd thought to beat the alarum, and urge

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relentless war,

<BR>But soon my fingers fail'd me, my face droop'd and I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resign'd myself,

<BR>To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dead;)

<BR>Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chances,

<BR>Of unsurpass'd heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equally brave;)

<BR>Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,

<BR>Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us?

<BR>What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,

<BR>Of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deepest remains?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>2</CENTER>

O maidens and young men I love and that love me,

<BR>What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your talking recalls,

<BR>Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover'd with sweat

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and dust,

<BR>In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the rush of successful charge,

<BR>Enter the captur'd works&amp;emdash;yet lo, like a swift running river

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they fade,

<BR>Pass and are gone they fade&amp;emdash;I dwell not on soldiers' perils

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or soldiers' joys,

<BR>(Both I remember well&amp;emdash;many of the hardships, few the joys,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet I was content.)



<P>&nbsp;But in silence, in dreams' projections,

<BR>While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,

<BR>So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; off the sand,

<BR>With hinged knees returning I enter the doors, (while for you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up there,

<BR>Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heart.)



<P>&nbsp;Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,

<BR>Straight and swift to my wounded I go,

<BR>Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,

<BR>Where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground,

<BR>Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hospital,

<BR>To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,

<BR>To each and all one after another I draw near, not one do I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miss,

<BR>An attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail,

<BR>Soon to be fill'd with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fill'd again.



<P>&nbsp;I onward go, I stop,

<BR>With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds,

<BR>I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,

<BR>One turns to me his appealing eyes&amp;emdash;poor boy! I never knew

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you,

<BR>Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that would save you.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>3</CENTER>

On, on I go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!)

<BR>The crush'd head I dress, (poor crazed hand tear not the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bandage away,)

<BR>The neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through I examine,

<BR>Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life struggles hard,

<BR>(Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death!

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In mercy come quickly.)



<P>&nbsp;From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,

<BR>I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; matter and blood,

<BR>Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv'd neck and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; side falling head,

<BR>His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bloody stump,

<BR>And has not yet look'd on it.



<P>&nbsp;I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,

<BR>But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sinking,

<BR>And the yellow-blue countenance see.

<BR>I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound,

<BR>Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sickening, so offensive,

<BR>While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and pail.



<P>&nbsp;I am faithful, I do not give out,

<BR>The fractur'd thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,

<BR>These and more I dress with impassive hand, (yet deep in my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breast a fire, a burning flame.)



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>4</CENTER>

Thus in silence in dreams' projections,

<BR>Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,

<BR>The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,

<BR>I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,

<BR>Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,

<BR>(Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have cross'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and rested,

<BR>Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)

<BR>Lightly falls from the finish'd Sabbath,

<P>&nbsp;Lo, the moon ascending,

<BR>Up from the east the silvery round moon,

<BR>Beautiful over the house-tops, ghastly, phantom moon,

<BR>Immense and silent moon.



<P>&nbsp;I see a sad procession,

<BR>And I hear the sound of coming full-key'd bugles,

<BR>All the channels of the city streets they're flooding,

<BR>As with voices and with tears.



<P>&nbsp;I hear the great drums pounding,

<BR>And the small drums steady whirring,

<BR>And every blow of the great convulsive drums,

<BR>Strikes me through and through.



<P>&nbsp;For the son is brought with the father,

<BR>(In the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell,

<BR>Two veterans son and father dropt together,

<P>&nbsp;Now nearer blow the bugles,

<BR>And the daylight o'er the pavement quite has faded,

<BR>And the strong dead-march enwraps me.



<P>&nbsp;In the eastern sky up-buoying,

<BR>The sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin'd,

<BR>('Tis some mother's large transparent face,

<BR>In heaven brighter growing.)



<P>&nbsp;O strong dead-march you please me!

<BR>O moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me!

<BR>O my soldiers twain! O my veterans passing to burial!

<BR>What I have I also give you.



<P>&nbsp;The moon gives you light,

<BR>And the bugles and the drums give you music,

<BR>My heart gives you love.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; midnight passes,

<BR>And through the stillness, through the dark, I hear, just hear,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the breath of my infant,

<BR>There in the room as I wake from sleep this vision presses

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon me;

<BR>The engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal,

<BR>The skirmishers begin, they crawl cautiously ahead, I hear

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the irregular snap! snap!

<BR>I hear the sounds of the different missiles, the short <I>t-h-t!</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t-h-t!</I> of the rifle-balls,

<BR>I see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds, I hear

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the great shells shrieking as they pass,

<BR>The grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (tumultuous now the contest rages,)

<BR>All the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again,

<BR>The crashing and smoking, the pride of the men in their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pieces,

<BR>The chief-gunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the right time,

<BR>After firing I see him lean aside and look eagerly off to note

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the effect;

<BR>Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging, (the young

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; colonel leads himself this time with brandish'd

sword,)

<BR>I see the gaps cut by the enemy's volleys, (quickly fill'd up, no

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delay,)

<BR>I breathe the suffocating smoke, then the flat clouds hover

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; low concealing all;

<BR>Now a strange lull for a few seconds, not a shot fired on

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; either side,

<BR>Then resumed the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and orders of officers,

<BR>While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to my ears a shout of applause, (some special

success,)

<BR>And ever the sound of the cannon far or near, (rousing even

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in dreams a devilish exultation and all the

old mad joy in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the depths of my soul,)

<BR>And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; batteries, cavalry, moving hither and thither,

<BR>(The falling, dying, I heed not, the wounded dripping and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; red I heed not, some to the rear are hobbling,)

<BR>Grime, heat, rush, aides-de-camp galloping by or on a full

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run,

<BR>With the patter of small arms, the warning <I>s-s-t</I> of the rifles,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (these in my vision I hear or see,)

<BR>And bombs bursting in air, and at night the vari-color'd

<CENTER><I>(Washington City, 1865)</I></CENTER>

H<FONT SIZE=-1>ow</FONT> solemn as one by one,

<BR>As the ranks returning worn and sweaty, as the men file by

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where I stand,

<BR>As the faces the masks appear, as I glance at the faces studying

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the masks,

<BR>(As I glance upward out of this page studying you, dear friend,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whoever you are,)

<BR>How solemn the thought of my whispering soul to each in the ranks,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to you!

<BR>I see behind each mask that wonder a kindred soul,

<BR>O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend,

<BR>Nor the bayonet stab what you really are;

<BR>The soul! yourself I see, great as any, good as the best,

<BR>Waiting secure and content, which the bullet could never

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kill,

<BR>Nor the bayonet stab O friend.

<CENTER>AS I LAY WITH MY HEAD IN YOUR LAP CAMERADO</CENTER>

A<FONT SIZE=-1>s</FONT> I lay with my head in your lap camerado,

<BR>The confession I made I resume, what I said to you and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open air I resume,

<BR>I know I am restless and make others so,

<BR>I know my words are weapons full of danger, full of death,

<BR>For I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsettle them,

<BR>I am more resolute because all have denied me than I could

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ever have been had all accepted me,

<BR>I heed not and have never heeded either experience, cautions,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; majorities, nor ridicule,

<BR>And the threat of what is call'd hell is little or nothing to me,

<BR>And the lure of what is call'd heaven is little or nothing to me;

<BR>Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and still urge you, without the least idea

what is our

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destination,

<BR>Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell'd and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defeated.

<BR>Flag of death! (how I watch'd you through the smoke of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; battle pressing!

<BR>How I heard you flap and rustle, cloth defiant!)

<BR>Flag cerulean&amp;emdash;sunny flag, with the orbs of night dappled!

<CENTER>TO A CERTAIN CIVILIAN</CENTER>

D<FONT SIZE=-1>id</FONT> you ask dulcet rhymes from me?

<BR>Did you seek the civilian's peaceful and languishing rhymes?

<BR>Did you find what I sang erewhile so hard to follow?

<BR>Why I was not singing erewhile for you to follow, to understand&amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor am I now;

<BR>(I have been born of the same as the war was born,

<BR>The drum-corps' rattle is ever to me sweet music, I love well

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the martial dirge,

<BR>With slow wail and convulsive throb leading the officer's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; funeral;)

<BR>What to such as you anyhow such a poet as I? therefore leave

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my works,

<BR>And go lull yourself with what you can understand, and with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; piano-tunes,

<BR>For I lull nobody, and you will never understand me.

<BR>Dominant, with the dazzling sun around thee,

<BR>Flauntest now unharm'd in immortal soundness and bloom&amp;emdash;lo,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in these hours supreme,

<BR>No poem proud, I chanting bring to thee, nor mastery's rapturous

<BR>And psalms of the dead.

S<FONT SIZE=-1>pirit</FONT> whose work is done&amp;emdash;spirit of dreadful

hours!

<BR>Ere departing fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets;

<BR>Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts, (yet onward ever unfaltering

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pressing,)

<BR>Spirit of many a solemn day and many a savage scene&amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electric spirit,

<BR>That with muttering voice through the war now closed, like a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tireless phantom flitted,

<BR>Rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beat the drum,

<BR>Now as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to the last,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reverberates round me,

<BR>As your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return from the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; battles,

<BR>As the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders,

<BR>As I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders,

<BR>As those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them appearing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the distance, approach and pass on, returning

homeward,

<BR>Moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro to the right

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and left,

<BR>Evenly, lightly rising and falling while the steps keep time;

<BR>Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; death next day,

<BR>Touch my mouth ere you depart, press my lips close,

<BR>Leave me your pulses of rage&amp;emdash;bequeath them to me&amp;emdash;fill

me

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with currents convulsive,

<BR>Let them scorch and blister out of my chants when you are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gone,

<BR>Let them identify you to the future in these songs.

A<FONT SIZE=-1>dieu</FONT> O soldier,

<BR>You of the rude campaigning, (which we shared,)

<BR>The rapid march, the life of the camp,

<BR>The hot contention of opposing fronts, the long manoeuvre,

<P>&nbsp;Adieu dear comrade,

<BR>Your mission is fulfill'd&amp;emdash;but I, more warlike,

<BR>Myself and this contentious soul of mine,

<BR>Still on our own campaigning bound,

<BR>Through untried roads with ambushes opponents lined,

<BR>Through many a sharp defeat and many a crisis, often

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; baffled,

<BR>Here marching, ever marching on, a war fight out&amp;emdash;aye

<BR>To the plains of the poems of heroes, to the prairies spreading

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wide,

<BR>To the far-off sea and the unseen winds, and the sane impalpable

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; air;

<BR>And responding they answer all, (but not in words,)

<BR>The average earth, the witness of war and peace, acknowledges

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mutely,

<BR>The prairie draws me close, as the father to bosom broad the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; son,

<BR>The Northern ice and rain that began me nourish me to the

<BR>But the hot sun of the South is to fully ripen my songs.

FROM PENT-UP ACHING RIVERS</H2></CENTER>

F<FONT SIZE=-1>ROM</FONT> pent-up aching rivers,

<BR>From my own voice resonant, singing the phallus,

<BR>Singing the song of procreation,

<BR>Singing the need of superb children and therein superb grown

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people,

<BR>Singing the muscular urge and the blending,

<BR>Singing the bedfellow's song, (O resistless yearning!

<BR>O for any and each the body correlative attracting!

<BR>O for you whoever you are your correlative body! O it,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than all else, you delighting!)

<P>&nbsp;From native moments, from bashful pains, singing them,

<BR>Seeking something yet unfound though I have diligently

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sought it many a long year,

<BR>Singing the true song of the soul fitful at random,

<BR>Renascent with grossest Nature or among animals,

<BR>Of that, of them and what goes with them my poems

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; informing,

<BR>Of the smell of apples and lemons, of the pairing of birds,

<BR>The welcome nearness, the sight of the perfect body,

<BR>The female form approaching, I pensive, love-flesh tremulous

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aching,

<BR>The divine list for myself or you or for any one making,

<BR>The face, the limbs, the index from head to foot, and what it

<BR>(Yet a moment O tender waiter, and I return,)

I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC</H2></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>





<P>I <FONT SIZE=-1>SING</FONT> the body electric,

<BR>The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them,

<BR>They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,

<BR>And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the soul.



<P>&nbsp;Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conceal themselves?



<P>&nbsp;And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the dead?

<BR>And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul?

<BR>And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>2</CENTER>





<P>The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself balks account,

<BR>That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.



<P>&nbsp;The expression of the face balks account,

<BR>But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his face,

<BR>It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his hips and wrists,

<BR>It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and knees, dress does not hide him,

<BR>The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and broad-cloth,

<BR>To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more,

<BR>You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shoulder-side.



<P>&nbsp;The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women, the folds of their dress, their style

as we pass in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the street, the contour of their shape downwards,

<BR>The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through the transparent green-shine, or lies

with his face

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave

of the water,

<BR>The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the horseman in his saddle,

<BR>Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,

<BR>The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dinner kettles, and their wives waiting,

<BR>The female soothing a child, the farmer's daughter in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; garden or cow-yard,

<BR>The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; six horses through the crowd,



<P>&nbsp;The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the

vacant lot

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at sundown after work,

<BR>The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resistance,

<BR>The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blinding the eyes;

<BR>The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; muscle through clean-setting trowsers and

waist-straps,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,

<BR>The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; curv'd neck and the counting;

<BR>Such-like I love &amp;emdash; I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother's breast with the little child,

<BR>Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; line with the firemen, and pause, listen,

count.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>3</CENTER>





<P>I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons,

<BR>And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sons.



<P>&nbsp;This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,

<BR>The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his

black eyes,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the richness and breadth of his manners,

<BR>These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,

<BR>He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,

<BR>They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,

<BR>They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; personal love,

<BR>He drank water only, the blood show'd like scarlet through

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the clear-brown skin of his face,

<BR>He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail'd his boat himself,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner,

he had

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fowling-pieces presented to him by men that

loved him,



<P>&nbsp;When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the

most beautiful

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and vigorous of the gang,

<BR>You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sit by him in the boat that you and he might

touch each other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<CENTER>4</CENTER>





<P>I have perceiv'd that to be with those I like is enough,

<BR>To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,

<BR>To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flesh is enough,

<BR>To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so lightly round his or her neck for a moment,

what is this then?

<BR>I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea.



<P>&nbsp;There is something in staying close to men and women and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; looking on them, and in the contact and odor

of them,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that pleases the soul well,

<BR>All things please the soul, but these please the soul well.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>5</CENTER>





<P>This is the female form,

<BR>A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot,

<BR>It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction,

<BR>I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vapor, all falls aside but myself and it,

<BR>Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what was expected of heaven or fear'd of hell,

are now

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consumed,

<BR>Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; likewise ungovernable,

<BR>Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mine too diffused,

<BR>Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swelling and deliciously aching,

<BR>Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice,



<P>&nbsp;Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prostrate dawn,

<BR>Undulating into the willing and yielding day,

<BR>Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh'd day.



<P>&nbsp;This the nucleus&amp;emdash;after the child is born of woman,

man is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; born of woman,

<BR>This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the outlet again.



<P>&nbsp;Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the exit of the rest,

<BR>You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.



<P>&nbsp;The female contains all qualities and tempers them,

<BR>She is in her place and moves with perfect balance,

<BR>She is all things duly veil'd, she is both passive and active,

<BR>She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as daughters.



<P>&nbsp;As I see my soul reflected in Nature,

<BR>As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sanity, beauty,

<BR>See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Female I see.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>6</CENTER>





<P>The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place,

<BR>He too is all qualities, he is action and power,

<BR>The flush of the known universe is in him,

<BR>Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him well,

<BR>Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just as much as you,

<BR>Each has his or her place in the procession.



<P>&nbsp;(All is a procession,

<BR>The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.)



<P>&nbsp;Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant?

<BR>Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no right to a sight?

<BR>Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and

and vegetation sprouts,

<BR>For you only, and not for him and her?

<P>A man's body at auction,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sale,)

<BR>I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; business.



<P>&nbsp;Gentlemen look on this wonder,

<BR>Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for it,

<BR>For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one animal or plant,

<BR>For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll'd.



<P>&nbsp;In this head the all-baffling brain,

<BR>In it and below it the makings of heroes.



<P>&nbsp;Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tendon and nerve,

<BR>They shall be stript that you may see them.



<P>&nbsp;Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,

<BR>Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flabby, good-sized arms and legs,

<BR>And wonders within there yet.



<P>&nbsp;Within there runs blood,

<BR>The same old blood! the same red-running blood!

<BR>There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reachings, aspirations,

<BR>(Do you think they are not there because they are not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; express'd in parlors and lecture-rooms?)



<P>&nbsp;This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be fathers in their turns,

<BR>In him the start of populous states and rich republics,

<BR>Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and enjoyments.



<P>&nbsp;How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offspring through the centuries?

<BR>(Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could trace back through the centuries?)

<P>A woman's body at auction,

<BR>She too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mothers,

<BR>She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mothers.



<P>&nbsp;Have you ever loved the body of a woman?

<BR>Have you ever loved the body of a man?

<BR>Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nations and times all over the earth?



<P>&nbsp;If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred,

<BR>And the glory and sweat of a man is the token of manhood

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untainted,

<BR>And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more beautiful than the most beautiful face.



<P>&nbsp;Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the fool that corrupted her own live body?

<BR>For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; themselves.

<BR>Yet all were lacking if sex were lacking, or if the moisture of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the right man were lacking.

<BR>Sex contains all, bodies, souls,

<BR>Meanings, proofs, purities, delicacies, results, promulgations,

<BR>Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal mystery, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seminal milk,

<BR>All hopes, benefactions, bestowals, all the passions, loves,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beauties, delights of the earth,

<BR>All the governments, judges, gods, follow'd persons of the earth,



<P>&nbsp;These are contain'd in sex as parts of itself and justifications

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of itself.



<P>&nbsp;Without shame the man I like knows and avows the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deliciousness of his sex,

<BR>Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers.



<P>&nbsp;Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women,

<BR>I will go stay with her who waits for me, and with those

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women that are warm-blooded and sufficient

for me,

<BR>I see that they understand me and do not deny me,

<BR>I see that they are worthy of me, I will be the robust husband

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of those women.



<P>&nbsp;They are not one jot less than I am,

<BR>They are tann'd in the face by shining suns and blowing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; winds,

<BR>Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength,

<BR>They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, run,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strike, retreat, advance, resist, defend themselves,

<BR>They are ultimate in their own right&amp;emdash;they are calm, clear,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well-possess'd of themselves.



<P>&nbsp;I draw you close to me, you women,

<BR>I cannot let you go, I would do you good,

<BR>I am for you, and you are for me, not only for our own sake,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but for others' sakes,

<BR>Envelop'd in you sleep greater heroes and bards,

<BR>They refuse to awake at the touch of any man but me.



<P>&nbsp;It is I, you women, I make my way,

<BR>I am stern, acrid, large, undissuadable, but I love you,

<BR>I do not hurt you any more than is necessary for you,

<BR>I pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for these States,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I press with slow rude muscle,

<BR>I brace myself effectually, I listen to no entreaties,

<BR>I dare not withdraw till I deposit what has so long

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accumulated within me.



<P>&nbsp;Through you I drain the pent-up rivers of myself,

<BR>In you I wrap a thousand onward years,



<P>&nbsp;On you I graft the grafts of the best-beloved of me and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America,

<BR>The drops I distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; girls, new artists, musicians, and singers,

<BR>The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn,

<BR>I shall demand perfect men and women out of my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love-spendings,

<BR>I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others, as I and you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interpenetrate now,

<BR>I shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of them, as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I count on the fruits of the gushing showers

I give now,

<BR>I shall look for loving crops from the birth, life, death,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; immortality, I plant so lovingly now.

<I>Proud Music of the Storm</I></H1></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>

P<FONT SIZE=-1>roud</FONT> music of the storm,

<BR>Blast that careers so free, whistling across the prairies,

<BR>Strong hum of forest tree-tops&amp;emdash;wind of the mountains,

<BR>Personified dim shapes&amp;emdash;you hidden orchestras,

<BR>You serenades of phantoms with instruments alert,

<BR>Bending with Nature's rhythmus all the tongues of nations;

<BR>You chords left as by vast composers&amp;emdash;you choruses,

<BR>You formless, free, religious dances&amp;emdash;you from the Orient,

<BR>You undertone of rivers, roar of pouring cataracts,

<BR>You sounds from distant guns with galloping cavalry,

<BR>Echoes of camps with all the different bugle-calls,

<BR>Trooping tumultuous, filling the midnight late, bending me

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerless,

<BR>Entering my lonesome slumber-chamber, why have you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seiz'd me?



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>2</CENTER>

Come forward O my soul, and let the rest retire,

<BR>Listen, lose not, it is toward thee they tend,

<BR>Parting the midnight, entering my slumber-chamber,

<BR>For thee they sing and dance O soul.



<P>&nbsp;A festival song,

<BR>The duet of the bridegroom and the bride, a marriage-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; march,

<BR>With lips of love, and hearts of lovers fill'd to the brim with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love,

<BR>The red-flush'd cheeks and perfumes, the cortege swarming

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; full of friendly faces young and old,

<BR>To flutes' clear notes and sounding harps' cantabile.



<P>&nbsp;Now loud approaching drums,

<BR>Victoria! see'st thou in powder-smoke the banners torn but

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flying? the rout of the baffled?

<BR>Hearest those shouts of a conquering army?

<BR>(Ah soul, the sobs of women, the wounded groaning in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agony,

<BR>The hiss and crackle of flames, the blacken'd ruins, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; embers of cities,

<BR>The dirge and desolation of mankind.)



<P>&nbsp;Now airs antique and mediaeval fill me,

<BR>I see and hear old harpers with their harps at Welsh festivals,

<BR>I hear the minnesingers singing their lays of love,

<BR>I hear the minstrels, gleemen, troubadours, of the middle

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ages.



<P>&nbsp;Now the great organ sounds,

<BR>Tremulous, while underneath, (as the hid footholds of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth,

<BR>On which arising rest, and leaping forth depend,

<BR>All shapes of beauty, grace and strength, all hues we know,

<BR>Green blades of grass and warbling birds, children that gambol

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and play, the clouds of heaven above,)

<BR>The strong base stands, and its pulsations intermits not,

<BR>Bathing, supporting, merging all the rest, maternity of all the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rest,

<BR>And with it every instrument in multitudes,

<BR>The players playing, all the world's musicians,

<BR>The solemn hymns and masses rousing adoration,

<BR>All passionate heart-chants, sorrowful appeals,

<BR>The measureless sweet vocalists of ages,

<BR>And for their solvent setting earth's own diapason,

<BR>Of winds and woods and mighty ocean waves,

<BR>A new composite orchestra, binder of years and climes,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tenfold renewer,

<BR>As of the far-back days the poets tell, the Paradiso,

<BR>The straying thence, the separation long, but now the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wandering done,

<BR>The journey done, the journeyman come home,

<BR>And man and art with Nature fused again.



<P>&nbsp;Tutti! for earth and heaven;

<BR>(The Almighty leader now for once has signal'd with his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wand.)



<P>&nbsp;The manly strophe of the husbands of the world,

<BR>And all the wives responding.



<P>&nbsp;The tongues of violins,

<BR>(I think O tongues ye tell this heart, that cannot tell itself,

<BR>This brooding yearning heart, that cannot tell itself.)



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>3</CENTER>

Ah from a little child,

<BR>Thou knowest soul how to me all sounds became music,

<BR>My mother's voice in lullaby or hymn,

<BR>(The voice, O tender voices, memory's loving voices,

<BR>Last miracle of all, O dearest mother's, sister's, voices;)

<BR>The rain, the growing corn, the breeze among the long-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leav'd corn,

<BR>The measur'd sea-surf beating on the sand,

<BR>The twittering bird, the hawk's sharp scream,

<BR>The wild-fowl's notes at night as flying low migrating north

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or south,

<BR>The psalm in the country church or mid the clustering trees,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the open air camp-meeting,

<BR>The fiddler in the tavern, the glee, the long-strung sailor-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; song,

<BR>The lowing cattle, bleating sheep, the crowing cock at dawn.



<P>&nbsp;All songs of current lands come sounding round me,

<BR>The German airs of friendship, wine and love,

<BR>Irish ballads, merry jigs and dances, English warbles,

<BR>Chansons of France, Scotch tunes, and o'er the rest,

<BR>Italia's peerless compositions.



<P>&nbsp;Across the stage with pallor on her face, yet lurid passion,

<BR>Stalks Norma brandishing the dagger in her hand.



<P>&nbsp;I see poor crazed Lucia's eyes' unnatural gleam,

<BR>Her hair down her back falls loose and dishevel'd.



<P>&nbsp;I see where Ernani walking the bridal garden,

<BR>Amid the scent of night-roses, radiant, holding his bride by

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the hand,

<BR>Hears the infernal call, the death-pledge of the horn.



<P>&nbsp;To crossing swords and gray hairs bared to heaven,

<BR>The clear electric base and baritone of the world,

<BR>The trombone duo, Libertad forever!



<P>&nbsp;From Spanish chestnut trees' dense shade,

<BR>By old and heavy convent walls a wailing song,

<BR>Song of lost love, the torch of youth and life quench'd in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; despair,

<BR>Song of the dying swan, Fernando's heart is breaking.



<P>&nbsp;Awaking from her woes at last retriev'd Amina sings,

<BR>Copious as stars and glad as morning light the torrents of her

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; joy.



<P>&nbsp;(The teeming lady comes,

<BR>The lustrous orb, Venus contralto, the blooming mother,

<BR>Sister of loftiest gods, Alboni's self I hear.)



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>4</CENTER>

I hear those odes, symphonies, operas,

<BR>I hear in the <I>William Tell</I> the music of an arous'd and angry

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people,

<BR>I hear Meyerbeer's <I>Huguenots</I>, the <I>Prophet</I>, or <I>Robert</I>,

<BR>Gounod's <I>Faust</I>, or Mozart's <I>Don Juan</I>.



<P>&nbsp;I hear the dance-music of all nations,

<BR>The waltz, some delicious measure, lapsing, bathing me in bliss,

<BR>The bolero to tinkling guitars and clattering castanets.



<P>&nbsp;I see religious dances old and new,

<BR>I hear the sound of the Hebrew lyre,

<BR>I see the crusaders marching bearing the cross on high, to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; martial clang of cymbals,

<BR>I hear dervishes monotonously chanting, interspers'd with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frantic shouts, as they spin around turning always

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; towards Mecca,



<P>&nbsp;I see the rapt religious dances of the Persians and the Arabs,

<BR>Again, at Eleusis, home of Ceres, I see the modern Greeks

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dancing,

<BR>I hear them clapping their hands as they bend their bodies,

<BR>I hear the metrical shuffling of their feet.

<BR>I see again the wild old Corybantian dance, the performers

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wounding each other,

<BR>I see the Roman youth to the shrill sound of flageolets throwing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and catching their weapons,

<BR>As they fall on their knees and rise again.

<BR>I hear from the Mussulman mosque the muezzin calling,

<BR>I see the worshippers within, nor form nor sermon, argument

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor word,

<BR>But silent, strange, devout, rais'd glowing heads, ecstatic

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; faces.

<BR>I hear the Egyptian harp of many strings,

<BR>The primitive chants of the Nile boatmen,

<BR>The sacred imperial hymns of China,

<BR>To the delicate sounds of the king, (the stricken wood and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stone,)

<BR>Or to Hindu flutes and the fretting twang of the vina,

<BR>A band of bayaderes.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>5</CENTER>

Now Asia, Africa leave me, Europe seizing inflates me,

<BR>To organs huge and bands I hear as from vast concourses of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; voices,

<BR>Luther's strong hymn <I>Eine feste Burg ist unser Gott</I>,

<BR>Rossini's <I>Stabat Mater dolorosa</I>,

<BR>Or floating in some high cathedral dim with gorgeous color'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; windows,

<BR>The passionate <I>Agnus Dei</I> or <I>Gloria in Excelsis</I>.

<BR>Composers! mighty maestros!

<BR>And you, sweet singers of old lands, soprani, tenori, bassi!

<BR>To you a new bard caroling in the West,

<BR>Obeisant sends his love.



<P>&nbsp;(Such led to thee O soul,

<BR>All senses, shows and objects, lead to thee,

<BR>But now it seems to me sound leads o'er all the rest.)

<BR>I hear the annual singing of the children in St. Paul's cathedral,

<BR>Or, under the high roof of some colossal hall, the symphonies,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oratorios of Beethoven, Handel, or Haydn,

<BR>The <I>Creation</I> in billows of godhood laves me.

<BR>Give me to hold all sounds, (I madly struggling cry,)

<BR>Fill me with all the voices of the universe,

<BR>Endow me with their throbbings, Nature's also,

<BR>The tempests, waters, winds, operas and chants, marches and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dances,

<BR>Utter, pour in, for I would take them all!



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>6</CENTER>

Then I woke softly,

<BR>And pausing, questioning awhile the music of my dream,

<BR>And questioning all those reminiscences, the tempest in its

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fury,

<BR>And all the songs of sopranos and tenors,

<BR>And those rapt oriental dances of religious fervor,

<BR>And the sweet varied instruments, and the diapason of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; organs,

<BR>And all the artless plaints of love and grief and death,

<BR>I said to my silent curious soul out of the bed of the slumber-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chamber,

<BR>Come, for I have found the clew I sought so long,

<BR>Let us go forth refresh'd amid the day,

<BR>Cheerfully tallying life, walking the world, the real,

<BR>Nourish'd henceforth by our celestial dream.

<BR>And I said, moreover,

<BR>Haply what thou hast heard O soul was not the sound of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; winds,

<BR>Nor dream of raging storm, nor sea-hawk's flapping wings

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor harsh scream,

<BR>Nor vocalism of sun-bright Italy,



<P>&nbsp;Nor German organ majestic, nor vast concourse of voices,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor layers of harmonies,

<BR>Nor strophes of husbands and wives, nor sound of marching

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soldiers,

<BR>Nor flutes, nor harps, nor the bugle-calls of camps,

<BR>But to a new rhythmus fitted for thee,

<BR>Poems bridging the way from Life to Death, vaguely wafted

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in night air, uncaught, unwritten,

<BR>Which let us go forth in the bold day and write.

<I>Prayer of Columbus</I></H1></CENTER>

A <FONT SIZE=-1>batter'd</FONT>, wreck'd old man,

<BR>Thrown on this savage shore, far, far from home,

<BR>Pent by the sea and dark rebellious brows, twelve dreary

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; months,

<BR>Sore, stiff with many toils, sicken'd and nigh to death,

<BR>I take my way along the island's edge,

<BR>Venting a heavy heart.



<P>&nbsp;I am too full of woe!

<BR>Haply I may not live another day;

<BR>I cannot rest O God, I cannot eat or drink or sleep,

<BR>Till I put forth myself, my prayer, once more to Thee,

<BR>Breathe, bathe myself once more in Thee, commune with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee,

<BR>Report myself once more to Thee.



<P>&nbsp;Thou knowest my years entire, my life,

<BR>My long and crowded life of active work, not adoration

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; merely;

<BR>Thou knowest the prayers and vigils of my youth,



<P>&nbsp;Thou knowest my manhood's solemn and visionary

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meditations,

<BR>Thou knowest how before I commenced I devoted all to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come to Thee,

<BR>Thou knowest I have in age ratified all those vows and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strictly kept them,

<BR>Thou knowest I have not once lost nor faith nor ecstasy in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee,

<BR>In shackles, prison'd, in disgrace, repining not,

<BR>Accepting all from Thee, as duly come from Thee.



<P>&nbsp;All my emprises have been fill'd with Thee,

<BR>My speculations, plans, begun and carried on in thought of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee,

<BR>Sailing the deep or journeying the land for Thee;

<BR>Intentions, purports, aspirations mine, leaving results to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee.



<P>&nbsp;O I am sure they really came from Thee,

<BR>The urge, the ardor, the unconquerable will,

<BR>The potent, felt, interior command, stronger than words,

<BR>A message from the Heavens whispering to me even in sleep,

<BR>These sped me on.



<P>&nbsp;By me and these the work so far accomplish'd,

<BR>By me earth's elder cloy'd and stifled lands uncloy'd,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unloos'd,

<BR>By me the hemispheres rounded and tied, the unknown to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; known.



<P>&nbsp;The end I know not, it is all in Thee,

<BR>Or small or great I know not&amp;emdash;haply what broad fields, what

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lands,

<BR>Haply the brutish measureless human undergrowth I know,

<BR>Transplanted there may rise to stature, knowledge worthy

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee,

<BR>Haply the swords I know may there indeed be turn'd to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reaping-tools,

<BR>Haply the lifeless cross I know, Europe's dead cross, may

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bud and blossom there.



<P>&nbsp;One effort more, my altar this bleak sand;

<BR>That Thou O God my life hast lighted,

<BR>With ray of light, steady, ineffable, vouchsafed of Thee,

<BR>Light rare untellable, lighting the very light,

<BR>Beyond all signs, descriptions, languages;

<BR>For that O God, be it my latest word, here on my knees,

<BR>Old, poor, and paralyzed, I thank Thee.



<P>&nbsp;My terminus near,

<BR>The clouds already closing in upon me,

<BR>The voyage balk'd, the course disputed, lost,

<BR>I yield my ships to Thee.



<P>&nbsp;My hands, my limbs grow nerveless,

<BR>My brain feels rack'd, bewilder'd,

<BR>Let the old timbers part, I will not part,

<BR>I will cling fast to Thee, O God, though the waves buffet me,

<BR>Thee, Thee at least I know.



<P>&nbsp;Is it the prophet's thought I speak, or am I raving?

<BR>What do I know of life? what of myself?

<BR>I know not even my own work past or present,

<BR>Dim ever-shifting guesses of it spread before me,

<BR>Of newer better worlds, their mighty parturition,

<BR>Mocking, perplexing me.



<P>&nbsp;And these things I see suddenly, what mean they?

<BR>As if some miracle, some hand divine unseal'd my eyes,

<BR>Shadowy vast shapes smile through the air and sky,

<BR>And on the distant waves sail countless ships,

<BR>And anthems in new tongues I hear saluting me.

<P>&nbsp;Human bodies are words, myriads of words,

<BR>(In the best poems re-appears the body, man's or woman's,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well-shaped, natural, gay,

<BR>Every part able, active, receptive, without shame or the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need of shame.)



<P>&nbsp;Air, soil, water, fire&amp;emdash;those are words,

<BR>I myself am a word with them&amp;emdash;my qualities interpenetrate

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with theirs&amp;emdash;my name is nothing

to them,

<BR>Though it were told in the three thousand languages, what would

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; air, soil, water, fire, know of my name?



<P>&nbsp;A healthy presence, a friendly or commanding gesture, are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; words, sayings, meanings,

<BR>The charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are sayings and meanings also.



<P>&nbsp;The workmanship of souls is by those inaudible words of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth,

<BR>The masters know the earth's words and use them more than

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; audible words.



<P>&nbsp;Amelioration is one of the earth's words,

<BR>The earth neither lags nor hastens,



<P>&nbsp;It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from

the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jump,

<BR>It is not half beautiful only, defects and excrescences show

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just as much as perfections show.



<P>&nbsp;The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough,

<BR>The truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conceal'd either,

<BR>They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print,

<BR>They are imbued through all things conveying themselves

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; willingly,

<BR>Conveying a sentiment and invitation, I utter and utter,

<BR>I speak not, yet if you hear me not of what avail am I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to you?

<BR>To bear, to better, lacking these of what avail am I?



<P>&nbsp;(Accouche! accouchez!

<BR>Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?

<BR>Will you squat and stifle there?)



<P>&nbsp;The earth does not argue,

<BR>Is not pathetic, has no arrangements,

<BR>Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,

<BR>Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,

<BR>Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out,

<BR>Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; none out.



<P>&nbsp;The earth does not exhibit itself nor refuse to exhibit

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself, possesses still underneath,

<BR>Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heroes, the wail of slaves,

<BR>Persuasions of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying, laughter

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of young people, accents of bargainers,

<BR>Underneath these possessing words that never fail.



<P>&nbsp;To her children the words of the eloquent dumb great

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother never fail,

<BR>The true words do not fail, for motion does not fail and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reflection does not fail,

<BR>Also the day and night do not fail, and the voyage we

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pursue does not fail.



<P>&nbsp;Of the interminable sisters,

<BR>Of the ceaseless cotillions of sisters,

<BR>Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; younger sisters,

<BR>The beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest.



<P>&nbsp;With her ample back towards every beholder,

<BR>With the fascinations of youth and the equal fascinations

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of age,

<BR>Sits she whom I too love like the rest, sits undisturb'd,

<BR>Holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while her eyes glance back from it,

<BR>Glance as she sits, inviting none, denying none,

<BR>Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; face.



<P>&nbsp;Seen at hand or seen at a distance,

<BR>Duly the twenty-four appear in public every day,

<BR>Duly approach and pass with their companions or a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; companion,

<BR>Looking from no countenances of their own, but from the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; countenances of those who are with them,

<BR>From the countenances of children or women or the manly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; countenance,

<BR>From the open countenances of animals or from inanimate

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things,

<BR>From the landscape or waters or from the exquisite apparition

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the sky,

<BR>From our countenances, mine and yours, faithfully returning

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,

<BR>Every day in public appearing without fail, but never twice

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the same companions.



<P>&nbsp;Embracing man, embracing all, proceed the three hundred

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sixty-five resistlessly round the sun;

<BR>Embracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close three hundred

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sixty-five offsets of the first, sure

and necessary as they.



<P>&nbsp;Tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading,

<BR>Sunshine, storm, cold, heat, forever withstanding, passing,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carrying,



<P>&nbsp;The soul's realization and determination still inheriting,

<BR>The fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing,

<BR>No balk retarding, no anchor anchoring, on no rock striking,

<BR>Swift, glad, content, unbereav'd, nothing losing,

<BR>Of all able and ready at any time to give strict account,

<BR>The divine ship sails the divine sea.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>2</CENTER>





<P>Whoever you are! motion and reflection are especially for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you,

<BR>The divine ship sails the divine sea for you.



<P>&nbsp;Whoever you are! you are he or she for whom the earth is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; solid and liquid,

<BR>You are he or she for whom the sun and moon hang in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sky,

<BR>For none more than you are the present and the past,

<BR>For none more than you is immortality.



<P>&nbsp;Each man to himself and each woman to herself, is the word

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the past and present, and the true word

of immortality;

<BR>No one can acquire for another&amp;emdash;not one,

<BR>Not one can grow for another&amp;emdash;not one.



<P>&nbsp;The song is to the singer, and comes back most to him,

<BR>The teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to him,

<BR>The murder is to the murderer, and comes back most to him,

<BR>The theft is to the thief, and comes back most to him,

<BR>The love is to the lover, and comes back most to him,

<BR>The gift is to the giver, and comes back most to him&amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it cannot fail,

<BR>The oration is to the orator, the acting is to the actor and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actress not to the audience,

<BR>And no man understands any greatness or goodness but his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own, or the indication of his own.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>3</CENTER>





<P>I swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or her who

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be complete,

<BR>The earth remains jagged and broken only to him or her who

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remains jagged and broken.



<P>&nbsp;I swear there is no greatness or power that does not emulate

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those of the earth,

<BR>There can be no theory of any account unless it corroborate

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the theory of the earth,

<BR>No politics, song, religion, behavior, or what not, is of account,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unless it compare with the amplitude of the

earth,

<BR>Unless it face the exactness, vitality, impartiality, rectitude

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the earth.



<P>&nbsp;I swear I begin to see love with sweeter spasms than that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which responds love,

<BR>It is that which contains itself, which never invites and never

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refuses.



<P>&nbsp;I swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible words,

<BR>All merges toward the presentation of the unspoken meanings

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the earth,

<BR>Toward him who sings the songs of the body and of the truths

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the earth,

<BR>Toward him who makes the dictionaries of words that print

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot touch.



<P>&nbsp;I swear I see what is better than to tell the best,

<BR>It is always to leave the best untold.



<P>&nbsp;When I undertake to tell the best I find I cannot,

<BR>My tongue is ineffectual on its pivots,

<BR>My breath will not be obedient to its organs,

<BR>I become a dumb man.



<P>&nbsp;The best of the earth cannot be told anyhow, all or any is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; best,

<BR>It is not what you anticipated, it is cheaper, easier, nearer,

<BR>Things are not dismiss'd from the places they held before,

<BR>The earth is just as positive and direct as it was before,

<BR>Facts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, are as real

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as before,

<BR>But the soul is also real, it too is positive and direct,

<BR>No reasoning, no proof has establish'd it,

<BR>Undeniable growth has establish'd it.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>4</CENTER>





<P>These to echo the tones of souls and the phrases of souls,

<BR>(If they did not echo the phrases of souls what were they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then?

<BR>If they had not reference to you in especial what were they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then?)

<BR>I swear I will never henceforth have to do with the faith that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tells the best,

<BR>I will have to do only with that faith that leaves the best

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untold.



<P>&nbsp;Say on, sayers! sing on, singers!

<BR>Delve! mould! pile the words of the earth!

<BR>Work on, age after age, nothing is to be lost,

<BR>It may have to wait long, but it will certainly come in use,

<BR>When the materials are all prepared and ready, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; architects shall appear.



<P>&nbsp;I swear to you the architects shall appear without fail,

<BR>I swear to you they will understand you and justify you,

<BR>The greatest among them shall be he who best knows you,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and encloses all and is faithful to all,

<BR>He and the rest shall not forget you, they shall perceive that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you are not an iota less than they,

<BR>You shall be fully glorified in them.

<P>&nbsp;Ripples of unseen rivers, tides of a current flowing, forever

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flowing,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; human tears?)



<P>&nbsp;I see, just see skyward, great cloud-masses,

<BR>Mournfully slowly they roll, silently swelling and mixing,

<BR>With at times a half-dimm'd sadden'd far-off star,

<BR>Appearing and disappearing.

<BR>On the frontiers to eyes impenetrable,

<CENTER>ASSURANCES</CENTER>

I <FONT SIZE=-1>need</FONT> no assurances, I am a man who is pre-occupied

I am

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not cognizant of, calm and actual faces,

<BR>I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; latent in any iota of the world,

<BR>I do not doubt I am limitless, and that the universes are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; limitless, in vain I try to think how limitless,

<BR>I do not doubt that the orbs and the systems of orbs play

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their swift sports through the air on purpose, and

that I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall one day be eligible to do as much as they,

and more

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than they,

<BR>I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on millions

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of years,

<BR>I do not doubt interiors have their interiors, and exteriors

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have their exteriors, and that the eyesight has

another

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eyesight, and the hearing another hearing, and the

voice

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another voice,

<BR>I do not doubt that the passionately-wept deaths of young

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men are provided for, and that the deaths of young

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women and the deaths of little children are provided

for,

<BR>(Did you think Life was so well provided for, and Death, the

think

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now I never realized before.



<P>&nbsp;Now I absorb immortality and peace,

<BR>I admire death and test propositions.



<P>&nbsp;How plenteous! how spiritual! how resume!

<BR>The same old man and soul&amp;emdash;the same old aspirations, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the same content.



<P>&nbsp;I was thinking the day most splendid till I saw what the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notday exhibited,

<BR>I was thinking this globe enough till there sprang out so

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noiseless around me myriads of other globes.



<P>&nbsp;Now while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will measure myself by them,

<BR>And now touch'd with the lives of other globes arrived as far

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along as those of the earth,



<P>&nbsp;Or waiting to arrive, or pass'd on farther than those of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth,

<BR>I henceforth no more ignore them than I ignore my own life,

<BR>Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine, or waiting to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arrive.



<P>&nbsp;O I see now that life cannot exhibit all to me, as the day

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot,

<BR>I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.

As I sit with others at a great feast, suddenly while the music

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is playing,

<BR>To my mind, (whence it comes I know not,) spectral in mist

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a wreck at sea,

<BR>Of certain ships, how they sail from port with flying streamers

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and wafted kisses, and that is the last of them,

<BR>Of the solemn and murky mystery about the fate of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President,

<BR>Of the flower of the marine science of fifty generations

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; founder'd off the Northeast coast and going down&amp;emdash;of

the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steamship Arctic going down,

<BR>Of the veil'd tableau&amp;emdash;women gather'd together on deck,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pale, heroic, waiting the moment that draws so close&amp;emdash;O

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the moment!

<BR>A huge sob&amp;emdash;a few bubbles&amp;emdash;the white foam spirting

up&amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then the women gone,

<BR>Sinking there while the passionless wet flows on&amp;emdash;and I now

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pondering, Are those women gone?

<BR>Are souls drown'd and destroy'd so?

<BR>Is only matter triumphants?

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>"In the grand constellation of five or six names. under

Lincoln's Presidency, that history will bear for ages in her firmament

as marking the last life-throbs of secession, and beaming on its dying

gasps, Sheridan's will be bright. One consideration rising out of the now

dead soldier's example as it passes my mind, is worth taking notice of.

If the war had continued any long time these States, in my opinion, would

have shown and proved the most conclusive military talents ever evinced

by any nation on earth. That they possess'd a rank and file ahead of all

other known in points of quality and limitlessness of number are easily

admitted. But we have, too, the eligibility of organizing, handling and

officering equal to the other. These two, with modern arms, transportation

and inventive American genius, would make the United States with earnestness,

not only able to stand the whole world, but conquer that world united against

us."</FONT>

OSCEOLA</H2></CENTER>

and had long talks with him &amp;emdash; learn'd the occurrence below described

&amp;emdash; death of Osceola. The latter was a young, brave, leading Seminole,

in the Florida war of that time &amp;emdash; was surrender'd to our troops,

imprison'd, and literally died of "a broken heart", at Fort Moultrie. He

sicken'd of his confinement &amp;emdash; the doctor and officers made every

allowance and kindness possible for him; then the close</I>.)

<BR>Call'd for vermilion paint (his looking-glass was held before

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him,)

<BR>Painted half his face and neck, his wrists, and back-hands,

<BR>Put the scalp-knife carefully in his belt &amp;emdash; then lying down,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resting a moment,



<P>&nbsp;Rose again, half sitting, smiled, gave in silence his extended

A VOICE FROM DEATH</H2></CENTER>

<P>A <FONT SIZE=-1>VOICE</FONT> from Death, solemn and strange, in all

his sweep and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; power,

<BR>With sudden, indescribable blow &amp;emdash; towns drown'd &amp;emdash;

humanity

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by thousands slain,

<BR>The vaunted work of thrift, goods, dwellings, forge, street,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iron bridge,

<BR>Dash'd pell-mell by the blow &amp;emdash; yet usher'd life continuing

on,

<BR>(Amid the rest, amid the rushing, whirling, wild debris,

<BR>A suffering woman saved &amp;emdash; a baby safely born!)

<BR>Although I come and unannounc'd, in horror and in pang,

<BR>In pouring flood and fire, and wholesale elemental crash,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (this voice so solemn, strange,)

<BR>I too a minister of Deity.



<P>&nbsp;Yea, Death, we bow our faces, veil our eyes to thee,

<BR>We mourn the old, the young untimely drawn to thee,

<BR>The fair, the strong, the good, the capable,

<BR>The household wreck'd, the husband and the wife, the engulf'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forger in his forge,

<BR>The corpses in the whelming waters and the mud,

<BR>The gather'd thousands to their funeral mounds, and thousands

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; never found or gather'd.



<P>&nbsp;Then after burying, mourning the dead,

<BR>(Faithful to them found or unfound, forgetting not, bearing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the past, here new musing,)

<BR>A day &amp;emdash; a passing moment or an hour &amp;emdash; America

itself bends

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; low,

<BR>Silent, resign'd, submissive.



<P>&nbsp;War, death, cataclysm like this, America,

<BR>Take deep to thy proud prosperous heart.



<P>&nbsp;E'en as I chant, Io! out of death, and out of ooze and slime,

<BR>The blossoms rapidly blooming, sympathy, help, love,

<BR>From West and East, from South and North and over sea,

<BR>Its hot-spurr'd hearts and hands humanity to human aid

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moves on;

<BR>And from within a thought and lesson yet.



<P>&nbsp;Thou ever-darting Globe! through Space and Air!

<BR>Thou waters that encompass us!

<BR>Thou that in all the life and death of us, in action or in sleep!

<BR>Thou laws invisible that permeate them and all,

<BR>Thou that in all, and over all, and through and under all,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incessant!

<BR>Thou! thou! the vital, universal, giant force resistless,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleepless, calm,

<BR>Holding Humanity as in thy open hand, as some ephemeral

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toy,

<BR>How ill to e'er forget thee!



<P>&nbsp;For I too have forgotten,

<BR>(Wrapt in these little potencies of progress, politics, culture,

<BR>Contestants, battles, crowds, bridges, wharves,

GOOD-BYE MY FANCY!</H2></CENTER>

G<FONT SIZE=-1>OOD-BYE</FONT> my Fancy!

<BR>Farewell dear mate, dear love!

<BR>I'm going away, I know not where,

<BR>Or to what fortune, or whether I may ever see you again,

<BR>So Good-bye my Fancy.



<P>&nbsp;Now for my last &amp;emdash; let me look back a moment;

<BR>The slower fainter ticking of the clock is in me,

<BR>Exit, nightfall, and soon the heart-thud stopping.



<P>&nbsp;Long have we lived, joy'd, caress'd together;

<BR>Delightful! &amp;emdash; now separation &amp;emdash; Good-bye my Fancy.



<P>&nbsp;Yet let me not be too hasty,

<BR>Long indeed have we lived, slept, filter'd, become really

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blended into one;

<BR>Then if we die we die together, (yes, we'll remain one,)

<BR>If we go anywhere we'll go together to meet what happens,

<BR>May-be we'll be better off and blither, and learn something,

<BR>May-be it is yourself now really ushering me to the true songs,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (who knows?)

<BR>May-be it is you the mortal knob really undoing, turning &amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so now finally,

<BR>Good-bye &amp;emdash; and hail! my Fancy.

<PRE>1891&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1891-2</PRE>

<A NAME="ftn1"></A><SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>*</FONT></SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>Behind

a Good-bye there lurks much of the salutation of another beginning&amp;emdash;to

me, Development, Continuity, Immortality, Transformation, are the chiefest

life-meanings of Nature and Humanity, and are the <I>sine qua non</I> of

all facts, and each fact.</FONT>



<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=-1>Why do folks dwell so fondly on the last words,

advice, appearance, of the departing? Those last words are not samples

of the best, which involve vitality at its full, and balance, and perfect

control and scope. But they are valuable beyond measure to confirm and

endorse the varied train, facts, theories and faith of the whole preceding

life.</FONT>



<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="ftn2"></A><SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>*</FONT></SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>NOTE.

&amp;emdash; <I>Summer country life</I>. &amp;emdash; <I>Several years</I>.

&amp;emdash; In my rambles and explorations I found a woody place near

the creek, where for some reason the birds in happy mood seem'd to resort

in unusual numbers. Especially at the beginning of the day, and again at

the ending, I was sure to get there the most copious bird-concerts. I repair'd

there frequently at sunrise &amp;emdash; and also at sunset, or just before.

. . . Once the question arose in me: Which is the best singing, the first

or the latter-most? The first always exhilarated, and perhaps seem'd more

joyous and stronger; but I always felt the sunset or late afternoon sounds

more penetrating and sweeter &amp;emdash; seem'd to touch the soul &amp;emdash;

often the evening thrushes, two or three of them, responding and perhaps

blending. Though I miss'd some of the mornings, I found myself getting

to be quite strictly punctual at the evening utterances.</FONT>



<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=-1>ANOTHER NOTE. &amp;emdash;"He went out with the

tide and the sunset," was a phrase I heard from a surgeon describing an

old sailor's death under peculiarly gentle conditions.</FONT>



<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=-1>During the Secession War, 1863 and '4, visiting

the Army Hospitals around Washington, I form'd the habit, and continued

it to the end, whenever the ebb or flood tide began the latter part of

the day, of punctually visiting those at that time populous wards of suffering

men. Somehow (or I thought so) the effect of the hour was palpable. The

badly wounded would get some ease, and would like to talk a little, or

be talk'd to. Intellectual and emotional natures would be at their best:

Deaths were always easier; medicines seem'd to have better effect when

given then, and a lulling atmosphere would pervade the wards.</FONT>



<P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=-1>Similar influences, similar circumstances and hours,

day-close, after great battles, even with all their horrors. I had more

than once the same experience on the fields cover'd with fallen or dead.</FONT>

of Alabama and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Texas,

<BR>Always California's golden hills and hollows, and the silver

soft-breath'd Cuba,

<BR>Always the vast slope drain'd by the Southern sea, inseparable

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the slopes drain'd by the Eastern and

Western seas,

<BR>The area the eighty-third year of these States, the three and a half

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; millions of square miles,

<BR>The eighteen thousand miles of sea-coast and bay-coast on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main, the thirty thousand miles of river navigation,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the snows;

<BR>Always these compact lands tied at the hips with the belt stringing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the huge oval lakes;

<BR>Always the West with strong native persons, the increasing density

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there, the habitans, friendly, threatening,

ironical, scorning invaders;

<BR>All sights, South, North, East&amp;emdash;all deeds promiscuously done

at

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all times,

<BR>All characters, movements, growths, a few noticed, myriads unnoticed,

<BR>Through Mannahatta's streets I walking, these things gathering,

<BR>On interior rivers by night in the glare of pine knots, steam-boats

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wooding up,

<BR>Sunlight by day on the valley of the Susquehanna, and on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; valleys of the Potomac and Rappahannock, and

the valleys of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Roanoke and Delaware,



<P>&nbsp;In their northerly wilds beasts of prey haunting the Adirondacks

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the hills, or lapping the Saginaw waters to

drink,

<BR>In a lonesome inlet a sheldrake lost from the flock, sitting on

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the water rocking silently,

<BR>In farmers' barns oxen in the stable, their harvest labor done,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they rest standing, they are too tired,

<BR>Afar on arctic ice the she-walrus lying drowsily while her cubs

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; play around,

<BR>The hawk sailing where men have not yet sail'd, the farthest polar

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sea, ripply, crystalline, open, beyond the

floes,

<BR>White drift spooning ahead where the ship in the tempest dashes,

<BR>On solid land what is done in cities as the bells strike midnight

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; together,

<BR>In primitive woods the sounds there also sounding, the howl of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wolf, the scream of the panther, and the hoarse

bellow of the elk,

<BR>In winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead lake, in summer

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; visible through the clear waters, the great

trout swimming,

<BR>In lower latitudes in warmer air in the Carolinas the large black

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buzzard floating slowly high beyond the tree

tops,

<BR>Below, the red cedar festoon'd with tylandria, the pines and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cypresses growing out of the white sand that

spreads far and flat,

<BR>Rude boats descending the big Pedee, climbing plants, parasites with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; color'd flowers and berries enveloping huge

trees,

<BR>The waving drapery on the live-oak trailing long and low, noiselessly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waved by the wind,

<BR>The camp of Georgia wagoners just after dark, the supperfires and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cooking and eating by whites and negroes,

<BR>Thirty or forty great wagons, the mules, cattle, horses, feeding

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from troughs,

<BR>The shadows, gleams, up under the leaves of the old sycamore-trees,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the flames with the black smoke from the pitch-pine

curling and rising;

<BR>Southern fishermen fishing, the sounds and inlets of North Carolina's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coast, the shad-fishery and the herring-fishery,

the large

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweep-seines, the windlasses on shore work'd

by horses, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearing, curing, and packing-houses;

<BR>Deep in the forest in piney woods turpentine dropping from the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incisions in the trees, there are the turpentine

works,

<BR>There are the negroes at work in good health, the ground in all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directions is cover'd with pine straw;

<BR>In Tennessee and Kentucky slaves busy in the coalings, at the forge,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the furnace-blaze, or at the corn-shucking,

<BR>In Virginia, the planter's son returning after a long absence, joyfully

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; welcom'd and kiss'd by the aged mulatto nurse,

<BR>On rivers boatmen safely moor'd at nightfall in their boats under

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shelter of high banks,

<BR>Some of the younger men dance to the sound of the banjo or fiddle,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; others sit on the gunwale smoking and talking;

<BR>Late in the afternoon the mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the Great Dismal Swamp,

<BR>There are the greenish waters, the resinous odor, the plenteous moss,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cypress-tree, and the juniper-tree;

<BR>Northward, young men of Mannahatta, the target company from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an excursion returning home at evening, the

musket-muzzles

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all bear bunches of flowers presented by women;

<BR>Children at play, or on his father's lap a young boy fallen asleep,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (how his lips move! how he smiles in his sleep!)

<BR>The scout riding on horseback over the plains west of the Mississippi,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he ascends a knoll and sweeps his eyes around;

<BR>California life, the miner, bearded, dress'd in his rude costume,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the stanch California friendship, the sweet

air, the graves one

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in passing meets solitary just aside the horse-path;

<BR>Down in Texas the cotton-field, the negro-cabins, drivers driving

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mules or oxen before rude carts, cotton bales

piled on banks

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and wharves;

<BR>Encircling all, vast-darting up and wide, the American Soul,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with equal hemispheres, one Love, one Dilation

or Pride;

<BR>In arriere the peace-talk with the Iroquois the aborigines, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calumet, the pipe of good-will, arbitration,

and indorsement,



<P>&nbsp;The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun and then

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toward the earth,

<BR>The drama of the scalp-dance enacted with painted faces and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guttural exclamations,

<BR>The setting out of the war-party, the long and stealthy march,

<BR>The single file, the swinging hatchets, the surprise and slaughter

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of enemies;

<BR>All the acts, scenes, ways, persons, attitudes of these States,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reminiscences, institutions,

<BR>All these States compact, every square mile of these States

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without excepting a particle;

<BR>Me pleas'd, rambling in lanes and country fields, Paumanok's fields,

<BR>Observing the spiral flight of two little yellow butterflies shuffling

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between each other, ascending high in the

air,

<BR>The darting swallow, the destroyer of insects, the fall traveler

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; southward but returning northward early in

the spring,

<BR>The country boy at the close of the day driving the herd of cows

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and shouting to them as they loiter to browse

by the roadside,

<BR>The city wharf, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Orleans, San Francisco,

<BR>The departing ships when the sailors heave at the capstan;

<BR>Evening&amp;emdash;me in my room&amp;emdash;the setting sun,

<BR>The setting summer sun shining in my open window, showing the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swarm of flies, suspended, balancing in the

air in the centre of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the room, darting athwart, up and down, casting

swift shadows,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in specks on the opposite wall where the shine

is;

<BR>The athletic American matron speaking in public to crowds of listeners,

<BR>Males, females, immigrants, combinations, the copiousness, the

money-makers,

<BR>Factories, machinery, the mechanical forces, the windlass, lever,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pulley, all certainties,

<BR>The certainty of space, increase, freedom, futurity,

<BR>In space the sporades, the scatter'd islands, the stars&amp;emdash;on

the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; firm earth, the lands, my lands,



<P>&nbsp;O lands! all so dear to me&amp;emdash;what you are, (whatever

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; putting it at random in these songs, become

a part of that,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever it is,

<BR>Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow flapping, with the

of Florida,

<BR>Otherways there atwixt the banks of the Arkansas, the Rio Grande,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the

Red River, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saskatchewan or the Osage, I with the spring

waters laughing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and skipping and running,

<BR>Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parties of snowy herons wading in the wet

to seek worms and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aquatic plants,

<BR>Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crow with its bill, for amusement&amp;emdash;and

I triumphantly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twittering,

<BR>The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; themselves, the body of the flock feed, the

sentinels outside

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move around with erect heads watching, and

are from time to time

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reliev'd by other sentinels&amp;emdash;and

I feeding and taking turns

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the rest,

<BR>In Kanadian forests the moose, large as an ox, corner'd by hunters,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rising desperately on his hind-feet, and plunging

with his fore-feet,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the hoofs as sharp as knives&amp;emdash;and

I, plunging at the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hunters, corner'd and desperate,

<BR>In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; countless workmen working in the shops,

<BR>And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof&amp;emdash;and no

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; less in myself than the whole of the Mannahatta

and made out

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to America, how can I do less than pass

the clew of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; union of them, to afford the like to you?

<I>The Sleepers</I></H1></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>

I <FONT SIZE=-1>wander</FONT> all night in my vision,

<BR>Stepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stopping,



<P>&nbsp;Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,

<BR>Wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contradictory,

<BR>Pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.



<P>&nbsp;How solemn they look there, stretch'd and still,

<BR>How quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles.



<P>&nbsp;The wretched features of ennuy&egrave;s, the white features of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corpses, the livid faces of drunkards, the sick-gray

faces

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of onanists,

<BR>The gash'd bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their strong-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; door'd rooms, the sacred idiots, the new-born emerging

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from gates, and the dying emerging from gates,

<BR>The night pervades them and infolds them.



<P>&nbsp;The married couple sleep calmly in their bed, he with his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; palm on the hip of the wife, and she with her palm

on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hip of the husband,

<BR>The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed,

<BR>The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs,

<BR>And the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapt.



<P>&nbsp;The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep,

<BR>The prisoner sleeps well in the prison, the runaway son

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleeps,

<BR>The murderer that is to be hung next day, how does he sleep?

<BR>And the murder'd person, how does he sleep?



<P>&nbsp;The female that loves unrequited sleeps,

<BR>And the male that loves unrequited sleeps,

<BR>The head of the money-maker that plotted all day sleeps,

<BR>And the enraged and treacherous dispositions, all, all sleep.



<P>&nbsp;I stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worst-suffering

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the most restless,

<BR>I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,

<BR>The restless sink in their beds, they fitfully sleep.



<P>&nbsp;Now I pierce the darkness, new beings appear,

<BR>The earth recedes from me into the night,



<P>&nbsp;I saw that it was beautiful, and I see that what is not the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth is beautiful.



<P>&nbsp;I go from bedside to bedside, I sleep close with the other

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleepers each in turn,

<BR>I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,

<BR>And I become the other dreamers.



<P>&nbsp;I am a dance&amp;emdash;play up there! the fit is whirling me

fast!



<P>&nbsp;I am the ever-laughing&amp;emdash;it is new moon and twilight,

<BR>I see the hiding of douceurs, I see nimble ghosts whichever

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; way I look,

<BR>Cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea, and where

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is neither ground nor sea.



<P>&nbsp;Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine,

<BR>Only from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could,

<BR>I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides,

<BR>And surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk,

<BR>To lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretch'd arms,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and resume the way;

<BR>Onward we move, a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shouting music and wild-flapping pennants of joy!



<P>&nbsp;I am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician,

<BR>The emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box,

<BR>He who has been famous and he who shall be famous after

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to-day,

<BR>The stammerer, the well-formed person, the wasted or feeble

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; person.



<P>&nbsp;I am she who adorn'd herself and folded her hair expectantly,

<BR>My truant lover has come, and it is dark.



<P>&nbsp;Double yourself and receive me darkness,

<BR>Receive me and my lover too, he will not let me go without

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him.



<P>&nbsp;I roll myself upon you as upon a bed, I resign myself to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dusk.



<P>&nbsp;He whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover,

<BR>He rises with me silently from the bed.



<P>&nbsp;Darkness, you are gentler than my lover, his flesh was sweaty

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and panting,

<BR>I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.



<P>&nbsp;My hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions,

<BR>I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; journeying.



<P>&nbsp;Be careful darkness! already what was it touch'd me?

<BR>I thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one,

<BR>I hear the heart-beat, I follow, I fade away.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>2</CENTER>

I descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,

<BR>Perfume and youth course through me and I am their wake.



<P>&nbsp;It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman's,

<BR>I sit low in a straw-bottom chair and carefully darn my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grandson's stockings.



<P>&nbsp;It is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the winter

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; midnight,

<BR>I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.



<P>&nbsp;A shroud I see and I am the shroud, I wrap a body and lie in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the coffin,

<BR>It is dark here under ground, it is not evil or pain here, it is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blank here, for reasons.



<P>&nbsp;(It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be happy,

<BR>Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he has enough.)



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>3</CENTER>

I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the eddies of the sea,



<P>&nbsp;His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with courageous arms, he urges himself with his

legs,

<BR>I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes,

<BR>I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foremost on the rocks.



<P>&nbsp;What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves?

<BR>Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prime of his middle age?



<P>&nbsp;Steady and long he struggles,

<BR>He is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd, he holds out while his strength

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; holds out,

<BR>The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they roll him, swing him, turn him,

<BR>His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continually bruis'd on rocks,

<BR>Swiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>4</CENTER>

I turn but do not extricate myself,

<BR>Confused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness yet.



<P>&nbsp;The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the wreck-guns

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sound,

<BR>The tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering through the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drifts.



<P>&nbsp;I look where the ship helplessly heads end on, I hear the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burst as she strikes, I hear the howls of dismay,

they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grow fainter and fainter.



<P>&nbsp;I cannot aid with my wringing fingers,

<BR>I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me.



<P>&nbsp;I search with the crowd, not one of the company is wash'd to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us alive,

<BR>In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a barn.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>5</CENTER>

Now of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,

<BR>Washington stands inside the lines, he stands on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intrench'd hills amid a crowd of officers,

<BR>His face is cold and damp, he cannot repress the weeping

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drops,

<BR>He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes, the color is blanch'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from his cheeks,

<BR>He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by their parents.



<P>&nbsp;The same at last and at last when peace is declared,

<BR>He stands in the room of the old tavern, the well-belov'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soldiers all pass through,

<BR>The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,

<BR>The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the cheek,

<BR>He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another, he shakes

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hands and bids good-by to the army.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>6</CENTER>

Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; together,

<BR>Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parents on the old homestead.



<P>&nbsp;A red squaw came one breakfast-time to the old homestead,

<BR>On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chairs,

<BR>Her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her face,

<BR>Her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exquisitely as she spoke.



<P>&nbsp;My mother looked in delight and amazement at the stranger,

<BR>She look'd at the freshness of her tall-borne face and full and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pliant limbs,

<BR>The more she look'd upon her she loved her,

<BR>Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,



<P>&nbsp;She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace, she

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cook'd food for her,

<BR>She had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fondness.



<P>&nbsp;The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the afternoon she went away,

<BR>O my mother was loth to have her go away,

<BR>All the week she thought of her, she watch'd for her many a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; month,

<BR>She remember'd her many a winter and many a summer,

<BR>But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>7</CENTER>

A show of the summer softness&amp;emdash;a contact of something unseen

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash;an amour of the light and air,

<BR>I am jealous and overwhelm'd with friendliness,

<BR>And will go gallivant with the light and air myself.



<P>&nbsp;O love and summer, you are in the dreams and in me,

<BR>Autumn and winter are in the dreams, the farmer goes with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his thrift,

<BR>The droves and crops increase, the barns are well-fill'd.



<P>&nbsp;Elements merge in the night, ships make tacks in the dreams,

<BR>The sailor sails, the exile returns home,

<BR>The fugitive returns unharm'd, the immigrant is back beyond

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; months and years,

<BR>The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the well-known neighbors and faces,

<BR>They warmly welcome him, he is barefoot again, he forgets

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he is well off,

<BR>The Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welshman voyage home, and the native of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mediterranean voyages home,

<BR>To every port of England, France, Spain, enter well-fill'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ships,

<BR>The Swiss foots it toward his hills, the Prussian goes his way,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Hungarian his way, and the Pole his way,

<BR>The Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian return.



<P>&nbsp;The homeward bound and the outward bound,

<BR>The beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuy&egrave;e, the onanist, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; female that loves unrequited, the money-maker,

<BR>The actor and actress, those through with their parts and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those waiting to commence,

<BR>The affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nominee that is chosen and the nominee that has

fail'd,

<BR>The great already known and the great any time after to-day,

<BR>The stammerer, the sick, the perfect-form'd, the homely,

<BR>The criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sentenced him, the fluent lawyers, the jury, the

audience,

<BR>The laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; red squaw,

<BR>The consumptive, the erysipalite, the idiot, he that is wrong'd,

<BR>The antipodes, and every one between this and them in the dark,

<BR>I swear they are averaged now&amp;emdash;one is no better than the

other,

<BR>The night and sleep have liken'd them and restored them.



<P>&nbsp;I swear they are all beautiful,

<BR>Every one that sleeps is beautiful, every thing in the dim light

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is beautiful,

<BR>The wildest and bloodiest is over, and all is peace.



<P>&nbsp;Peace is always beautiful,

<BR>The myth of heaven indicates peace and night.



<P>&nbsp;The myth of heaven indicates the soul,

<BR>The soul is always beautiful, it appears more or it appears less,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it comes or it lags behind,

<BR>It comes from its embower'd garden and looks pleasantly on

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself and encloses the world,

<BR>Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting, and perfect

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and clean the womb cohering,

<BR>The head well-grown proportion'd and plumb, and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bowels and joints proportion'd and plumb.



<P>&nbsp;The soul is always beautiful,

<BR>The universe is duly in order, every thing is in its place,

<BR>What has arrived is in its place and what waits shall be in its

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place,



<P>&nbsp;The twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood waits,

<BR>The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; child of the drunkard waits long, and the drunkard

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; himself waits long,

<BR>The sleepers that lived and died wait, the far advanced are to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go on in their turns, and the far behind are to

come on in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their turns,

<BR>The diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unite&amp;emdash;they unite now.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>8</CENTER>

The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed,

<BR>They flow hand in hand over the whole earth from east to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; west as they lie unclothed,

<BR>The Asiatic and African are hand in hand, the European and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; American are hand in hand,

<BR>Learn'd and unlearn'd are hand in hand, and male and female

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are hand in hand,

<BR>The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they press close without lust, his lips press her

neck,

<BR>The father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with measureless love, and the son holds the father

in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his arms with measureless love,

<BR>The white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; daughter,

<BR>The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man, friend is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inarm'd by friend,

<BR>The scholar kisses the teacher and the teacher kisses the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scholar, the wrong'd is made right,

<BR>The call of the slave is one with the master's call, and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; master salutes the slave,

<BR>The felon steps forth from the prison, the insane becomes sane,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the suffering of sick persons is reliev'd,

<BR>The sweatings and fevers stop, the throat that was unsound is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sound, the lungs of the consumptive are resumed,

the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poor distress'd head is free,

<BR>The joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smoother than ever,

<BR>Stiflings and passages open, the paralyzed become supple,



<P>&nbsp;They swell'd and convuls'd and congested awake to themselves

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in condition,

<BR>They pass the invigoration of the night and the chemistry of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the night, and awake.



<P>&nbsp;I too pass from the night,

<BR>I stay a while away O night, but I return to you again and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love you.



<P>&nbsp;Why should I be afraid to trust myself to you?

<BR>I am not afraid, I have been well brought forward by you,

<BR>I love the rich running day, but I do not desert her in whom I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lay so long,

<BR>I know not how I came of you and I know not where I go

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with you, but I know I came well and shall go well.



<P>&nbsp;I will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes,

<BR>I will duly pass the day O my mother, and duly return to you.



<P>&nbsp;

S<FONT SIZE=-1>inging</FONT> my days,

<BR>Singing the great achievements of the present,

<BR>Singing the strong light works of engineers,

<BR>Our modern wonders, (the antique ponderous Seven outvied,)

<BR>In the Old World the east the Suez canal,

<BR>The New by its mighty railroad spann'd,

<BR>The seas inlaid with eloquent gentle wires;

<BR>Yet first to sound, and ever sound, the cry with thee O soul,

<BR>The Past! the Past! the Past!



<P>&nbsp;The Past&amp;emdash;the dark unfathom'd retrospect!

<BR>The teeming gulf&amp;emdash;the sleepers and the shadows!

<BR>The past&amp;emdash;the infinite greatness of the past!

<BR>For what is the present after all but a growth out of the past?

<BR>(As a projectile form'd, impell'd, passing a certain line, still

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keeps on,

<BR>So the present, utterly form'd, impell'd by the past.)



<P>&nbsp;

Passage O soul to India!

<BR>Eclaircise the myths Asiatic, the primitive fables.

<BR>Not you alone proud truths of the world,

<BR>Nor you alone ye facts of modern science,

<BR>But myths and fables of eld, Asia's, Africa's fables,

<BR>The far-darting beams of the spirit, the unloos'd dreams,

<BR>The deep diving bibles and legends,

<BR>The daring plots of the poets, the elder religions;

<BR>O you temples fairer than lilies pour'd over by the rising

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sun!

<BR>O you fables spurning the known, eluding the hold of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; known, mounting to heaven!

<BR>You lofty and dazzling towers, pinnacled, red as roses,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burnish'd with gold!

<BR>Towers of fables immortal fashion'd from mortal dreams!

<BR>You too I welcome and fully the same as the rest!

<BR>You too with joy I sing.



<P>&nbsp;Passage to India!

<BR>Lo, soul, seest thou not God's purpose from the first?

<BR>The earth to be spann'd, connected by network,

<BR>The races, neighbors, to marry and be given in marriage,

<BR>The oceans to be cross'd, the distant brought near,

<BR>The lands to be welded together.



<P>&nbsp;A worship new I sing,

<BR>You captains, voyagers, explorers, yours,

<BR>You engineers, you architects, machinists, yours,

<BR>You, not for trade or transportation only,

<BR>But in God's name, and for thy sake O soul.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>3</CENTER>

Passage to India!

<BR>Lo soul for thee of tableaus twain,

<BR>I see in one the Suez canal initiated, open'd,

<BR>I see the procession of steamships, the Empress Eugenie's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leading the van,

<BR>I mark from on deck the strange landscape, the pure sky, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; level sand in the distance,

<BR>I pass swiftly the picturesque groups, the workmen gather'd,

<BR>The gigantic dredging machines.



<P>&nbsp;In one again, different, (yet thine, all thine, O soul, the same,)

<BR>I see over my own continent the Pacific railroad surmounting

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every barrier,

<BR>I see continual trains of cars winding along the Platte carrying

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freight and passengers,

<BR>I hear the locomotives rushing and roaring, and the shrill

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steam-whistle,

<BR>I hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the world,

<BR>I cross the Laramie plains, I note the rocks in grotesque

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shapes, the buttes,

<BR>I see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions, the barren,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; colorless, sage-deserts,

<BR>I see in glimpses afar or towering immediately above me the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great mountains, I see the Wind river and the Wahsatch

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mountains,

<BR>I see the Monument mountain and the Eagle's Nest, I pass

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Promontory, I ascend the Nevadas,

<BR>I scan the noble Elk mountain and wind around its base,

<BR>I see the Humboldt range, I thread the valley and cross the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; river,

<BR>I see the clear waters of lake Tahoe, I see forests of majestic

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pines,

<BR>Or crossing the great desert, the alkaline plains, I behold

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enchanting mirages of waters and meadows,

<BR>Marking through these and after all, in duplicate slender

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lines,

<BR>Bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel,

<BR>Tying the Eastern to the Western sea,

<BR>The road between Europe and Asia.

<BR>(Ah Genoese thy dream! thy dream!

<BR>Centuries after thou art laid in thy grave,

<BR>The shore thou foundest verifies thy dream.)

Passage to India!

<BR>Struggles of many a captain, tales of many a sailor dead,

<BR>Over my mood stealing and spreading they come,

<BR>Like clouds and cloudlets in the unreach'd sky.



<P>&nbsp;Along all history, down the slopes,

<BR>As a rivulet running, sinking now, and now again to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surface rising,

<BR>A ceaseless thought, a varied train&amp;emdash;lo, soul, to thee, thy

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sight, they rise,

<BR>The plans, the voyages again, the expeditions;

<BR>Again Vasco de Gama sails forth,

<BR>Again the knowledge gain'd, the mariner's compass,

<BR>Lands found and nations born, thou born America,

<BR>For purpose vast, man's long probation fill'd,

<BR>Thou rondure of the world at last accomplish'd.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>5</CENTER>

O vast Rondure, swimming in space,

<BR>Cover'd all over with visible power and beauty,

<BR>Alternate light and day and the teeming spiritual darkness,

<BR>Unspeakable high processions of sun and moon and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; countless stars above,

<BR>Below, the manifold grass and waters, animals, mountains,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trees,

<BR>With inscrutable purpose, some hidden prophetic intention,

<BR>Now first it seems my thought begins to span thee.

<BR>Down from the gardens of Asia descending radiating,

<BR>Adam and Eve appear, then their myriad progeny after

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,

<BR>Wandering, yearning, curious, with restless explorations,

<BR>With questionings, baffled, formless, feverish, with never-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happy hearts,

<BR>With that sad incessant refrain, <I>Wherefore unsatisfied soul</I>?

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and <I>Whither O mocking life</I>?

<BR>Ah who shall soothe these feverish children?

<BR>Who justify these restless explorations?

<BR>Who speak the secret of impassive earth?

<BR>Who bind it to us? what is this separate Nature so unnatural?

<BR>What is this earth to our affections? (unloving earth, without

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a throb to answer ours,

<BR>Cold earth, the place of graves.)



<P>&nbsp;Yet soul be sure the first intent remains, and shall be carried

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out,

<BR>Perhaps even now the time has arrived.

<BR>After the seas are all cross'd, (as they seem already cross'd,)

<BR>After the great captains and engineers have accomplish'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their work,

<BR>After the noble inventors, after the scientists, the chemist, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; geologist, ethnologist,

<BR>Finally shall come the poet worthy that name,

<BR>The true son of God shall come singing his songs.

<BR>Then not your deeds only O voyagers, O scientists and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inventors, shall be justified,

<BR>All these hearts as of fretted children shall be sooth'd,

<BR>All affection shall be fully responded to, the secret shall be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; told,

<BR>All these separations and gaps shall be taken up and hook'd and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; link'd together,

<BR>The whole earth, this cold, impassive, voiceless earth, shall

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be completely justified,

<BR>Trinitas divine shall be gloriously accomplish'd and compacted

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the true son of God, the poet,

<BR>(He shall indeed pass the straits and conquer the mountains,

<BR>He shall double the cape of Good Hope to some purpose,)

<BR>Nature and Man shall be disjoin'd and diffused no more,

<BR>The true son of God shall absolutely fuse them.



<P>&nbsp;

Year at whose wide-flung door I sing!

<BR>Year of the purpose accomplish'd!

<BR>Year of the marriage of continents, climates and oceans!

<BR>(No mere doge of Venice now wedding the Adriatic,)

<BR>I see O year in you the vast terraqueous globe given and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; giving all,

<BR>Europe to Asia, Africa join'd, and they to the New World,

<BR>The lands, geographies, dancing before you, holding a festival

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; garland,

<BR>As brides and bridegrooms hand in hand.



<P>&nbsp;Passage to India!

<BR>Cooling airs from Caucasus, far, soothing cradle of man,

<BR>The river Euphrates flowing, the past lit up again.



<P>&nbsp;Lo soul, the retrospect brought forward,

<BR>The old, most populous, wealthiest of earth's lands,

<BR>The streams of the Indus and the Ganges and their many

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affluents,

<BR>(I my shores of America walking to-day behold, resuming all,)

<BR>The tale of Alexander on his warlike marches suddenly dying,

<BR>On one side China and on the other side Persia and Arabia,

<BR>To the south the great seas and the bay of Bengal,

<BR>The flowing literatures, tremendous epics, religions, castes,

<BR>Old occult Brahma interminably far back, the tender and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; junior Buddha,

<BR>Central and southern empires and all their belongings,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possessors,

<BR>The wars of Tamerlane, the reign of Aurungzebe,

<BR>The traders, rulers, explorers, Moslems, Venetians, Byzantium,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Arabs, Portuguese,

<BR>The first travelers famous yet, Marco Polo, Batouta the Moor,

<BR>Doubts to be solv'd, the map incognita, blanks to be fill'd,

<BR>The foot of man unstay'd, the hands never at rest,

<BR>Thyself O soul that will not brook a challenge.



<P>&nbsp;The mediaeval navigators rise before me,

<BR>The world of 1492, with its awaken'd enterprise,

<BR>Something swelling in humanity now like the sap of the earth

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in spring,

<BR>The sunset splendor of chivalry declining.

<BR>And who art thou sad shade?

<BR>Gigantic, visionary, thyself a visionary,

<BR>With majestic limbs and pious beaming eyes,

<BR>Spreading around with every look of thine a golden world,

<BR>Enhuing it with gorgeous hues.



<P>&nbsp;As the chief histrion,

<BR>Down to the footlights walks in some great scena,

<BR>Dominating the rest I see the Admiral himself,

<BR>(History's type of courage, action, faith,)



<P>&nbsp;Behold him sail from Palos leading his little fleet,

<BR>His voyage behold, his return, his great fame,

<BR>His misfortunes, calumniators, behold him a prisoner,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chain'd,

<BR>Behold his dejection, poverty, death.



<P>&nbsp;(Curious in time I stand, noting the efforts of heroes,

<BR>Is the deferment long? bitter the slander, poverty, death?

<BR>Lies the seed unreck'd for centuries in the ground? lo, to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God's due occasion,

<BR>Uprising in the night, it sprouts, blooms,

<BR>And fills the earth with use and beauty.)



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>7</CENTER>

Passage indeed O soul to primal thought,

<BR>Not lands and seas alone, thy own clear freshness,

<BR>The young maturity of brood and bloom,

<BR>To realms of budding bibles.



<P>&nbsp;O soul, repressless, I with thee and thou with me,

<BR>Thy circumnavigation of the world begin,

<BR>Of man, the voyage of his mind's return,

<BR>To reason's early paradise,

<BR>Back, back to wisdom's birth, to innocent intuitions,

<BR>Again with fair creation.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>8</CENTER>

O we can wait no longer,

<BR>We too take ship O soul,

<BR>Joyous we too launch out on trackless seas,

<BR>Fearless for unknown shores on waves of ecstasy to sail,

<BR>Amid the wafting winds, (thou pressing me to thee, I thee to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me, O soul,)

<BR>Caroling free, singing our song of God,

<BR>Chanting our chant of pleasant exploration.

<BR>With laugh and many a kiss,

<BR>(Let others deprecate, let others weep for sin, remorse,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; humiliation,)

<BR>O soul thou pleasest me, I thee.

<BR>Ah more than any priest O soul we too believe in God,

<BR>But with the mystery of God we dare not dally.



<P>&nbsp;O soul thou pleasest me, I thee,

<BR>Sailing these seas or on the hills, or waking in the night,

<BR>Thoughts, silent thoughts, of Time and Space and Death, like

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waters flowing,

<BR>Bear me indeed as through the regions infinite,

<BR>Whose air I breathe, whose ripples hear, lave me all over,

<BR>Bathe me O God in thee, mounting to thee,

<BR>I and my soul to range in range of thee.



<P>&nbsp;O Thou transcendent,

<BR>Nameless, the fibre and the breath,

<BR>Light of the light, shedding forth universes, thou centre of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,

<BR>Thou mightier centre of the true, the good, the loving,

<BR>Thou moral, spiritual fountain&amp;emdash;affection's source&amp;emdash;thou

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reservoir,

<BR>(O pensive soul of me&amp;emdash;O thirst unsatisfied&amp;emdash;waitest

not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there?

<BR>Waitest not haply for us somewhere there the Comrade perfect?)

<BR>Thou pulse&amp;emdash;thou motive of the stars, suns, systems,

<BR>That, circling, move in order, safe, harmonious,

<BR>Athwart the shapeless vastnesses of space,

<BR>How should I think, how breathe a single breath, how speak,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if, out of myself,

<BR>I could not launch, to those, superior universes?



<P>&nbsp;Swiftly I shrivel at the thought of God,

<BR>At Nature and its wonders, Time and Space and Death,

<BR>But that I, turning, call to thee O soul, thou actual Me,

<BR>And lo, thou gently masterest the orbs,

<BR>Thou matest Time, smilest content at Death,

<BR>And fillest, swellest full the vastnesses of Space.



<P>&nbsp;Greater than stars or suns,

<BR>Bounding O soul thou journeyest forth;

<BR>What love than thine and ours could wider amplify?

<BR>What aspirations, wishes, outvie thine and ours O soul?



<P>&nbsp;What dreams of the ideal? what plans of purity, perfection,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strength,

<BR>What cheerful willingness for others' sake to give up all?

<BR>For others' sake to suffer all?



<P>&nbsp;Reckoning ahead O soul, when thou, the time achiev'd,

<BR>The seas all cross'd, weather'd the capes, the voyage done,

<BR>Surrounded, copest, frontest God, yieldest, the aim attain'd,

<BR>As fill'd with friendship, love complete, the Elder Brother

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; found,

<BR>The Younger melts in fondness in his arms.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>9</CENTER>

Passage to more than India!

<BR>Are thy wings plumed indeed for such far flights?

<BR>O soul, voyagest thou indeed on voyages like those?

<BR>Disportest thou on waters such as those?

<BR>Soundest below the Sanscrit and the Vedas?

<BR>Then have thy bent unleash'd.



<P>&nbsp;Passage to you, your shores, ye aged fierce enigmas!

<BR>Passage to you, to mastership of you, ye strangling problems!

<BR>You, strew'd with the wrecks of skeletons, that, living, never

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reach'd you.



<P>&nbsp;Passage to more than India!

<BR>O secret of the earth and sky!

<BR>Of you O waters of the sea! O winding creeks and rivers!

<BR>Of you O woods and fields! of you strong mountains of my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; land!

<BR>Of you O prairies! of you gray rocks!

<BR>O morning red! O clouds! O rain and snows!

<BR>O day and night, passage to you!

<BR>O sun and moon and all you stars! Sirius and Jupiter!

<BR>Passage to you!



<P>&nbsp;Passage, immediate passage! the blood burns in my veins!

<BR>Away O soul! hoist instantly the anchor!

<BR>Cut the hawsers&amp;emdash;haul out&amp;emdash;shake out every sail!

<BR>Have we not stood here like trees in the ground long enough?



<P>&nbsp;Have we not grovel'd here long enough, eating and drinking

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like mere brutes?

<BR>Have we not darken'd and dazed ourselves with books long

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enough?



<P>&nbsp;Sail forth&amp;emdash;steer for the deep waters only,

<BR>Reckless O soul, exploring, I with thee, and thou with me,

<BR>For we are bound where mariner has not yet dared to go,

<BR>And we will risk the ship, ourselves and all.



<P>&nbsp;O my brave soul!

<BR>O farther farther sail!

<BR>O daring joy, but safe! are they not all the seas of God?

<BR>O farther, farther, farther sail!

T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOU</FONT> orb full-dazzling! thou hot October noon!

<BR>Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand,

<BR>The sibilant near sea with vistas far and foam,

<BR>And tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue;

<BR>O sun of noon refulgent! my special word to thee.



<P>&nbsp;Hear me illustrious!

<BR>Thy lover me, for always I have loved thee,

<BR>Even as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wood edge, thy touching-distant beams enough,

<BR>Or man matured, or young or old, as now to thee I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launch my invocation.



<P>&nbsp;(Thou canst not with thy dumbness me deceive,

<BR>I know before the fitting man all Nature yields,

<BR>Though answering not in words, the skies, trees,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hear his voice&amp;emdash;and thou O sun,

<BR>As for thy throes, thy perturbations, sudden breaks

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and shafts of flame gigantic,

<BR>I understand them, I know those flames, those

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perturbations well.)



<P>&nbsp;Thou that with fructifying heat and light,

<BR>O'er myriad farms, o'er lands and waters North

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and South,

<BR>O'er Mississippi's endless course, o'er Texas'

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grassy plains, Kanada's woods,

<BR>O'er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining

<BR>Thou that impartially infoldest all, not only continents,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seas,

<BR>Thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flowers givest so liberally,



<P>&nbsp;Shed, shed thyself on mine and me, with but a fleeting

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ray out of thy million millions,

<BR>Strike though these chants.



<P>&nbsp;Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for these,

<BR>Prepare the later afternoon of me myself&amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prepare my lengthening shadows,

<BR>Prepare my starry nights.

FACES</H2></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>





<P>S<FONT SIZE=-1>AUNTERING</FONT> the pavement or riding the country by-road,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lo, such faces!

<BR>Faces of friendship, precision, caution, sauvity, ideality,

<BR>The spiritual-prescient face, the always welcome common

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; benevolent face,

<BR>The face of the singing of music, the grand faces of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; natural lawyers and judges broad at the back-top,

<BR>The faces of hunters and fishers bulged at the brows,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the shaved blanch'd faces of orthodox citizens,

<BR>The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning artist's face,

<BR>The ugly face of some beautiful soul, the handsome

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detested or despised face,

<BR>The sacred faces of infants, the illuminated face of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother of many children,

<BR>The face of an amour, the face of veneration,

<BR>The face as of a dream, the face of an immobile rock,

<BR>The face withdrawn of its good and bad, a castrated

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; face,

<BR>A wild hawk, his wings clipp'd by the clipper,

<BR>A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and knife

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the gelder.



<P>&nbsp;Sauntering the pavement thus, or crossing the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ceaseless ferry, faces and faces and faces,

<BR>I see them and complain not, and am content with all.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>2</CENTER>





<P>Do you suppose I could be content with all if I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thought them their own final&egrave;?



<P>&nbsp;This now is too lamentable a face for a man,

<BR>Some abject louse asking leave to be, cringing for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it,

<BR>Some milk-nosed maggot blessing what lets it wrig

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to its hole.



<P>&nbsp;This face is a dog's snout sniffing for garbage,

<BR>Snakes nest in that mouth, I hear the sibilant threat.



<P>&nbsp;This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea,

<BR>Its sleepy and wabbling icebergs crunch as they go.



<P>&nbsp;This is a face of bitter herbs, this an emetic, they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need no label,

<BR>And more of the drug-shelf, laudanum, caoutchouc,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or hog'slard.



<P>&nbsp;This face is an epilepsy, its wordless tongue gives

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out the earthly cry,

<BR>Its veins down the neck distend, its eyes roll till

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they show nothing but their whites,

<BR>Its teeth grit, the palms of the hands are cut by the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn'd-in nails,

<BR>The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while he speculates well.



<P>&nbsp;This face is bitten by vermin and worms,

<BR>And this is some murderer's knife with a half-pull'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scabbard.



<P>&nbsp;This face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee,

<BR>An unceasing death-bell tolls there.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>3</CENTER>





<P>Features of my equals would you trick me with your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creas'd and cadaverous march?

<BR>Well, you cannot trick me.



<P>&nbsp;I see your rounded never-erased flow,

<BR>I see 'neath the rims of your haggard and mean

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disguises.



<P>&nbsp;Splay and twist as you like, poke with the tangling

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fores of fishes or rats,

<BR>You'll be unmuzzled, you certainly will.



<P>&nbsp;I saw the face of the most smear'd and slobbering

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; idiot they had at the asylum,

<BR>And I knew for my consolation what they knew not,

<BR>I knew of the agents that emptied and broke my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brother,

<BR>The same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tenement,

<BR>And I shall look again in a score or two of ages,

<BR>And I shall meet the real landlord perfect and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unharm'd, every inch as good as myself.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>4</CENTER>





<P>The Lord advances, and yet advances,

<BR>Always the shadow in front, always the reach'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand bringing up the laggards.



<P>&nbsp;Out of this face emerge banners and horses&amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O superb! I see what is coming,

<BR>I see the high pioneer-caps, see staves of runners

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearing the way,

<BR>I hear victorious drums.



<P>&nbsp;This face is a life-boat,

<BR>This is the face commanding and bearded, it asks no

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; odds of the rest,

<BR>This face is flavor'd fruit ready for eating,

<BR>This face of a healthy honest boy is the programme

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of all good.



<P>&nbsp;These faces bear testimony slumbering or awake,

<BR>They show their descent from the Master himself.



<P>&nbsp;Off the word I have spoken I except not one&amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; red, white, black, are all deific,

<BR>In each house is the ovum, it comes forth after a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thousand years.



<P>&nbsp;Spots or cracks at the windows do not disturb me,

<BR>Tall and sufficient stand behind and make signs to me,

<BR>I read the promise and patiently wait.



<P>&nbsp;This is a full-grown lily's face,

<BR>She speaks to the limber-hipp'd man near the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; garden pickets,

<BR><I>Come here</I> she blushingly cries, <I>Come night</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to me limberhipp'd man,</I>

<BR><I>Stand at my side till I lean as high as I can</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon you</I>,

<BR><I>Fill me with albescent honey, bend down to me</I>,

<BR><I>Rub to me with your chafing beard, rub to my</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breast and shoulders</I>.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>5</CENTER>





<P>The old face of the mother of many children,

<BR>Whist! I am fully content.



<P>&nbsp;Lull'd and late is the smoke of the First-day morning,

<BR>It hangs low over the rows of trees by the fences,

<BR>It hangs thin by the sassafras and wild-cherry and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cat-brier under them.



<P>&nbsp;I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree,

<BR>I heard what the singers were singing so long,

<BR>Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the white

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; froth and the water-blue.



<P>&nbsp;Behold a woman!

<BR>She looks out from her quaker cap, her face is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearer and more beautiful than the sky.



<P>&nbsp;She sits in an armchair under the shaded porch

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the farmhouse,

<BR>The sun just shines on her old white head.



<P>&nbsp;Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen,

<BR>Her grandsons raised the flax, and her grand-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; daughters spin it with the distaff and the wheel.



<P>&nbsp;The melodious character of the earth,

<BR>The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and does not wish to go,

<BR>The justified mother of men.

THE MYSTIC TRUMPETER</H2></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>





<P>H<FONT SIZE=-1>ARK</FONT>, some wild trumpeter, some strange musician,

<BR>Hovering unseen in air, vibrates capricious tunes

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to-night.



<P>&nbsp;I hear thee trumpeter, listening alert I catch thy

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notes,

<BR>Now pouring, whirling like a tempest round me,

<BR>Now low, subdued, now in the distance lost.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>2</CENTER>





<P>Come nearer bodiless one, haply in thee resounds

<BR>Some dead composer, haply thy pensive life

<BR>Was fill'd with aspirations high, unform'd ideals,

<BR>Waves, oceans musical, chaotically surging,

<BR>That now ecstatic ghost, close to me bending,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thy cornet echoing, pealing,

<BR>Gives out to no one's ears but mine, but freely

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gives to mine,

<BR>That I may thee translate.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>3</CENTER>





<P>Blow trumpeter free and clear, I follow thee,

<BR>While at thy liquid prelude, glad, serene,

<BR>The fretting world, the streets, the noisy hours of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day withdraw,

<BR>A holy calm descends like dew upon me,

<BR>I walk in cool refreshing night the walks of Paradise,

<BR>I scent the grass, the moist air and the roses;

<BR>Thy song expands my numb'd imbonded spirit,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thou freest, launchest me,

<BR>Floating and basking upon heaven's lake.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>4</CENTER>





<P>Blow again trumpeter! and for my sensuous eyes,

<BR>Bring the old pageants, show the feudal world.



<P>&nbsp;What charm thy music works! thou makest pass

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before me,

<BR>Ladies and cavaliers long dead, barons are in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their castle halls, the troubadours are singing,

<BR>Arm'd knights go forth to redress wrongs, some

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in quest of the holy Graal;

<BR>I see the tournament, I see the contestants incased

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in heavy armor seated on stately champing

horses,

<BR>I hear the shouts, the sounds of blows and smiting

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steel;



<P>&nbsp;I see the Crusaders' tumultuous armies&amp;emdash;hark,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how the cymbals clang,

<BR>Lo, where the monks walk in advance, bearing the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cross on high.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>5</CENTER>





<P>Blow again trumpeter! and for thy theme,

<BR>Take now the enclosing theme of all, the solvent

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the setting,

<BR>Love, that is pulse of all, the sustenance and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pang,

<BR>The heart of man and woman all for love,

<BR>No other theme but love&amp;emdash;knitting,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enclosing, all-diffusing love.



<P>&nbsp;O how the immortal phantoms crowd around me!

<BR>I see the vast alembic ever working, I see and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know the flames that heat the world,

<BR>The glow, the blush, the beating hearts of lovers,

<BR>So blissful happy some, and some so silent, dark,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and nigh to death;

<BR>Love, that is all the earth to lovers&amp;emdash;love,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that mocks time and space,

<BR>Love, that is day and night&amp;emdash;love, that is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sun and moon and stars,

<BR>Love, that is crimson, sumptuous, sick with perfume,

<BR>No other words but words of love, no other thought

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but love.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>6</CENTER>





<P>Blow again trumpeter&amp;emdash;conjure war's alarums.



<P>&nbsp;Swift to thy spell a shuddering hum like distant

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thunder rolls,

<BR>Lo, where the arm'd men hasten&amp;emdash;lo, mid the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clouds of dust the glint of bayonets,

<BR>I see the grime-faced cannoneers, I mark the rosy flash

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amid the smoke, I hear the cracking of the

guns;

<BR>Nor war alone&amp;emdash;thy fearful music-song, wild

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prayer, brings every sight of fear,

<BR>The deeds of ruthless brigands, rapine, murder&amp;emdash;

<BR>I see ships foundering at sea, I behold on deck and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; below deck the terrible tableaus.

<P>O trumpeter, methinks I am myself the instrument

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thou playest,

<BR>Thou melt'st my heart, my brain&amp;emdash;thou movest,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drawest, changest them at will;

<BR>And now thy sullen notes send darkness through me,

<BR>Thou takest away all cheering light, all hope,

<BR>I see the enslaved, the overthrown, the hurt, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; opprest of the whole earth,

<BR>I feel the measureless shame and humiliation of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my race, it becomes all mine,

<BR>Mine too the revenges of humanity, the wrongs of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ages, baffled feuds and hatreds,

<BR>Utter defeat upon me weighs&amp;emdash;all lost&amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the foe victorious,

<BR>(Yet 'mid the ruins Pride colossal stands unshaken to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the last,

<BR>Endurance, resolution to the last.)

<P>Now trumpeter for thy close,

<BR>Vouchsafe a higher strain than any yet,

<BR>Sing to my soul, renew its languishing faith and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hope,

<BR>Rouse up my slow belief, give me some vision of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the future,

<BR>Give me for once its prophecy and joy.



<P>&nbsp;O glad, exulting, culminating song!

<BR>A vigor more than earth's is in thy notes,

<BR>Marches of victory&amp;emdash;man disenthral'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash;the conqueror at last,

<BR>Hymns to the universal God from universal man

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash;all joy!

<BR>A reborn race appears&amp;emdash;a perfect world,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all joy!

<BR>Women and men in wisdom innocence and health

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash;all joy!

<BR>Riotous laughing bacchanals fill'd with joy!

<BR>War, sorrow, suffering gone&amp;emdash;the rank earth

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purged&amp;emdash;nothing but joy left!

<BR>The ocean fill'd with joy&amp;emdash;the atmosphere

<BR>By day thy warning ringing bell to sound its notes,

<BR>By night thy silent signal lamps to swing.



<P>&nbsp;Fierce-throated beauty!

<BR>Law of thyself complete, thine own track firmly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; holding,

<BR>(No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; piano thine,)

<BR>Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return'd,

<BR>Launch'd o'er the prairies wide, across the lakes,

<BR>To the free skies unpent and glad and strong.

ALL IS TRUTH</H2></CENTER>

O <FONT SIZE=-1>ME</FONT>, man of slack faith so long,

<BR>Standing aloof, denying portions so long,

<BR>Only aware to-day of compact all-diffused truth,

<BR>Discovering to-day there is no lie or form of lie,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and can be none, but grows as inevitably upon

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself as the truth does upon itself,

<BR>Or as any law of the earth or any natural production

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the earth does.



<P>&nbsp;(This is curious and may not be realized immediately,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but it must be realized,

<BR>I feel in myself that I represent falsehoods equally

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the rest,

<BR>And that the universe does.)



<P>&nbsp;Where has fail'd a perfect return indifferent of lies

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the truth?

<BR>Is it upon the ground, or in water or fire? or in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spirit of man? or in the meat and blood?



<P>&nbsp;Meditating among liars and retreating sternly into

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myself, I see that there are really no liars

or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lies after all,

<BR>And that nothing fails its perfect return, and that

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what are called lies are perfect returns,

<BR>And that each thing exactly represents itself and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what has preceded it,

<BR>And that the truth includes all, and is compact just

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as much as space is compact,

<BR>And that there is no flaw or vacuum in the amount

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the truth&amp;emdash;but that all is truth

without

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exception;

<BR>And henceforth I will go celebrate any thing I see

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or am,

<BR>And sing and laugh and deny nothing.

<H2>

A RIDDLE SONG</H2></CENTER>

T<FONT SIZE=-1>HAT</FONT> which eludes this verse and any verse,

<BR>Unheard by sharpest ear, unform'd in clearest eye

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or cunningest mind,

<BR>Nor lore nor fame, nor happiness nor wealth,

<BR>And yet the pulse of every heart and life throughout

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the world incessantly,

<BR>Which you and I and all pursuing ever ever miss,

<BR>Open but still a secret, the real of the real, an

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; illusion,

<BR>Costless, vouchsafed to each, yet never man the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; owner,

<BR>Which poets vainly seek to put in rhyme, historians

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in prose,

<BR>Which sculptor never chisel'd yet, not painter painted,

<BR>Which vocalist never sung, nor orator nor actor ever

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; utter'd,

<BR>Invoking here and how I challenge for my song.



<P>&nbsp;Indifferently, 'mid public, private haunts, in solitude,

<BR>Behind the mountain and the wood,

<BR>Companion of the city's busiest streets, through

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the assemblage,

<BR>It and its radiations constantly glide.



<P>&nbsp;In looks of fair unconscious babes,

<BR>Or strangely in the coffin'd dead,

<BR>Or show of breaking dawn or stars by night,

<BR>As some dissolving delicate film of dreams,

<BR>Hiding yet lingering.



<P>&nbsp;Two little breaths of words comprising it,

<BR>Two words, yet all from first to last comprised

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in it.



<P>&nbsp;How ardently for it!

<BR>How many ships have sail'd and sunk for it!

<BR>How many travelers started from their homes and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ne'er return'd!

<BR>How much of genius boldly staked and lost for it!

<BR>What countless stores of beauty, love, ventur'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for it!

<BR>How all superbest deeds since Time began are

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; traceable to it&amp;emdash;and shall be to

the end!

<BR>How all heroic martyrdoms to it!



<P>&nbsp;How, justified by it, the horrors, evils, battles of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the earth!

<BR>How the bright fascinating lambent flames of it, in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every age and land, have drawn men's eyes,

<BR>Rich as a sunset on the Norway coast, the sky, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; islands, and the cliffs,

<BR>Or midnight's silent glowing northern lights unreachable.



<P>&nbsp;Haply God's riddle it, so vague and yet so certain,

<BR>The soul for it, and all the visible universe for it,

<BR>And heaven at last for it.

DEATH'S VALLEY</H2></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>To accompany a picture; by request.&nbsp;<qq>The Valley of the</I></CENTER>



<CENTER><I>Shadow of Death,</qq> from the painting by George Inness</I></CENTER>





<P>N<FONT SIZE=-1>AY</FONT>, do not dream, designer dark,

<BR>Thou hast portray'd or hit thy theme entire;

<BR>I, hoverer of late by this dark valley, by its confines,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having glimpses of it,

<BR>Here enter lists with thee, claiming my right to make a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; symbol too.



<P>&nbsp;For I have seen many wounded soldiers die,

<BR>After dread suffering &amp;emdash; have seen their lives

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pass off with smiles;

<BR>And I have watch'd the death-hours of the old; and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seen the infant die;

<BR>The rich with all his nurses and his doctors;

<BR>And then the poor, in meagreness and poverty;

<BR>And I myself for long, O Death, have breath'd my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every breath

<BR>Amid the nearness and the silent thought of thee.

<BR>And out of these and thee,

<BR>I make a scene, a song (not fear of thee,

<BR>Nor gloom's ravines, nor bleak, nor dark &amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for I do not fear thee,

<BR>Nor celebrate the struggle, or contortion, or hard-tied knot),

<BR>Of the broad blessed light and perfect air, with meadows,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rippling tides, and trees and flowers and

grass,

<BR>And the low hum of living breeze &amp;emdash; and in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; midst God's beautiful eternal right hand,

<BR>Thee, holiest minister of Heaven &amp;emdash; thee, envoy,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; usherer, guide at last of all,

<BR>Rich, florid, loosener of the stricture-knot call'd life,

<BR>Sweet, peaceful, welcome Death.

A THOUGHT OF COLUMBUS</H2></CENTER>

T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> mystery of mysteries, the crude and hurried ceaseless

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flame, spontaneous, bearing on itself.

<BR>The bubble and the huge, round, concrete orb!

<BR>A breath of Deity, as thence the bulging universe unfolding!

<BR>The many issuing cycles from their precedent minute!

<BR>The eras of the soul incepting in an hour,

<BR>Haply the widest, farthest evolutions of the world and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man.



<P>&nbsp;Thousands and thousands of miles hence, and now four

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; centuries back,

<BR>A mortal impulse thrilling its brain cell,

<BR>Reck'd or unreck'd, the birth can no longer be postpon'd:

<BR>A phantom of the moment, mystic, stalking, sudden,

<BR>Only a silent thought, yet toppling down of more than walls

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of brass or stone.

<BR>(A flutter at the darkness' edge as if old Time's and Space's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; secret near revealing.)

<BR>A thought! a definite thought works out in shape.

<BR>Four hundred years roll on.

<BR>The rapid cumulus &amp;emdash; trade, navigation, war, peace,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; democracy, roll on;

<BR>The restless armies and the fleets of time following their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leader &amp;emdash; the old camps of ages

pitch'd in newer,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; larger areas,

<BR>The tangl'd, long-deferr'd, &eacute;claircissement of human life and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hopes boldly begins untying,

<BR>As here to-day up-grows the Western World.



<P>&nbsp;(An added word yet to my song, far Discoverer, as ne'er

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before sent back to son of earth &amp;emdash;

<BR>If still thou hearest, hear me,

<BR>Voicing as now &amp;emdash; lands, races, arts, bravas to thee,

<BR>O'er the long backward path to thee &amp;emdash; one vast

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consensus north, south, east, west,

<BR>Soul plaudits! acclamation! reverent echoes!

<BR>One manifold, huge memory to thee! oceans and lands!

<BR>The modern world to thee and thought of thee!)

SCENTED HERBAGE OF MY BREAST</H2></CENTER>

S<FONT SIZE=-1>CENTED</FONT> herbage of my breast,

<BR>Leaves from you I glean, I write, to be perused best

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; afterwards,

<BR>Tomb-leaves, body-leaves growing up above me above death.



<P>&nbsp;Perennial roots, tall leaves, O the winter shall not freeze you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delicate leaves,

<BR>Every year shall you bloom again, out from where you retired

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you shall emerge again;

<BR>O I do not know whether many passing by will discover you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or inhale your faint odor, but I believe a

few will;

<BR>O slender leaves! O blossoms of my blood! I permit you to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tell in your own way of the heart that is

under you,

<BR>O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you are not happiness,

<BR>You are often more bitter than I can bear, you burn and sting

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,

<BR>Yet you are beautiful to me you faint-tinged roots, you make

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me think of death,

<BR>Death is beautiful from you, (what indeed is finally beautiful

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except death and love?)

<BR>O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lovers, I think it must be for death,

<BR>For how calm, how solemn it grows to ascend to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; atmosphere of lovers,

<BR>Death or life I am then indifferent, my soul declines to prefer,

<BR>(I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most,)

<BR>Indeed O death, I think now these leaves mean precisely the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same as you mean,

<BR>Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see! grow up out of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my breast!

<BR>Spring away from the conceal'd heart there!

<BR>Do not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots timid leaves!

<BR>Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my breast!

<BR>Come I am determin'd to unbare this broad breast of mine, I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have long enough stifled and choked;

<BR>Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you, now you serve

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me not,

<BR>I will say what I have to say by itself,

<BR>I will sound myself and comrades only, I will never again

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; utter a call only their call,

<BR>I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States,

<BR>I will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will through the States,



<P>&nbsp;Through me shall the words be said to make death

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exhilarating.

<BR>Give me your tone therefore O death, that I may accord with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it,

<BR>Give me yourself, for I see that you belong to me now above

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all, and are folded inseparably together,

you love and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; death are,

<BR>Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calling life,

<BR>For now it is convey'd to me that you are the purports

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; essential,

<BR>That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that they are mainly for you,

<BR>That you beyond them come forth to remain, the real reality,

<BR>That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, no

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; matter how long,

<BR>That you will one day perhaps take control of all,

<BR>That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance,

<BR>That may-be you are what it is all for, but it does not last so

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very long,

<BR>But you will last very long.

WHOEVER YOU ARE HOLDING ME NOW IN HAND</H2></CENTER>

W<FONT SIZE=-1>HOEVER</FONT> you are holding me now in hand,

<BR>Without one thing all will be useless,

<BR>I give you fair warning before you attempt me further,

<BR>I am not what you supposed, but far different.



<P>&nbsp;Who is he that would become my follower?

<BR>Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?



<P>&nbsp;The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destructive,

<BR>You would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be your sole and exclusive standard,

<BR>Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,



<P>&nbsp;The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lives around you would have to be abandon'd,

<BR>Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further, let go your hand from my shoulders,

<BR>Put me down and depart on your way.



<P>&nbsp;Or else by stealth in some wood for trial,

<BR>Or back of a rock in the open air,

<BR>(For in any roof'd room of a house I emerge not, nor in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; company,

<BR>And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dead,)

<BR>But just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any person for miles around approach unawares,

<BR>Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or some quiet island,

<BR>Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you,

<BR>With the comrade's long-dwelling kiss or the new husband's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kiss,

<BR>For I am the new husband and I am the comrade.



<P>&nbsp;Or if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,

<BR>Where I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hip,

<BR>Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;

<BR>For thus merely touching you is enough, is best,

<BR>And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eternally.



<P>&nbsp;But these leaves conning you con at peril,

<BR>For these leaves and me you will not understand,

<BR>They will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certainly elude you,

<BR>Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me, behold!

<BR>Already you see I have escaped from you.



<P>&nbsp;For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this book,

<BR>Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,



<P>&nbsp;Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; praise me,

<BR>Nor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; few) prove victorious,

<BR>Nor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evil, perhaps more,

<BR>For all is useless without that which you may guess at many

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; times and not hit, that which I hinted at;

<BR>Therefore release me and depart on your way.

THESE I SINGING IN SPRING</H2></CENTER>

T<FONT SIZE=-1>HESE</FONT> I singing in spring collect for lovers,

<BR>(For who but I should understand lovers and all their sorrow

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and joy?

<BR>And who but I should be the poet of comrades?)

<BR>Collecting I traverse the garden the world, but soon I pass

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gates,

<BR>Now along the pond-side, now wading in a little, fearing not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wet,



<P>&nbsp;Now by the post-and-rail fences where the old stones thrown

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there, pick'd from the fields, have accumulated,

<BR>(Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stones and partly cover them, beyond these

I pass,)

<BR>Far, far in the forest, or sauntering later in summer, before I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; think where I go,

<BR>Solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the silence,

<BR>Alone I had thought, yet soon a troop gathers around me,

<BR>Some walk by my side and some behind, and some embrace

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my arms or neck,

<BR>They the spirits of dear friends dead or alive, thicker they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come, a great crowd, and I in the middle,

<BR>Collecting, dispensing, singing, there I wander with them,

<BR>Plucking something for tokens, tossing toward whoever is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; near me,

<BR>Here, lilac, with a branch of pine,

<BR>Here, out of my pocket, some moss which I pull'd off a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; live-oak in Florida as it hung trailing down,

<BR>Here, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,

<BR>And here what I now draw from the water, wading in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pond-side,

<BR>(O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me, and returns

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again never to separate from me,

<BR>And this, O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this calamus-root shall,

<BR>Interchange it youths with each other! let none render it back!)

<BR>And twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut,

<BR>And stems of currants and plum-blows, and the aromatic

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cedar,

<BR>These I compass'd around by a thick cloud of spirits,

<BR>Wandering, point to or touch as I pass, or throw them loosely

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from me,

<BR>Indicating to each one what he shall have, giving something

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to each;

<BR>But what I drew from the water by the pond-side, that I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reserve,

<BR>I will give of it, but only to them that love as I myself am

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; capable of loving.

OF THE TERRIBLE DOUBT OF APPEARANCES</H2></CENTER>

O<FONT SIZE=-1>F</FONT> the terrible doubt of appearances,

<BR>Of the uncertainty after all, that we may be deluded,

<BR>That may-be reliance and hope are but speculations after all,

<BR>That may-be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only,

<BR>May-be the things I perceive, the animals, plants, men, hills,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shining and flowing waters,

<BR>The skies of day and night, colors, densities, forms, may-be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these are (as doubtless they are) only apparitions,

and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the real something has yet to be known,

<BR>(How often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and mock me!



<P>&nbsp;How often I think neither I know, nor any man knows, aught

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of them,)

<BR>May-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indeed but seem) as from my present point

of view, and

of what

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they appear, or nought anyhow, from entirely

changed

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; points of view;

<BR>To me these and the like of these are curiously answer'd by

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my lovers, my dear friends,

<BR>When he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; holding me by the hand,

<BR>When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reason hold not, surround us and pervade us,

<BR>Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom, I am

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silent, I require nothing further,

<BR>I cannot answer the question of appearances or that of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identity beyond the grave,

<BR>But I walk or sit indifferent, I am satisfied,

<BR>He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.

<P>&nbsp;Having studied the new and antique, the Greek and

<BR>See the philosophies all, Christian churches and tenets see,

<BR>Yet underneath Socrates clearly see, and underneath Christ

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the divine I see,



<P>&nbsp;The dear love of man for his comrade, the attraction of

<BR>Of the well-married husband and wife, of children and

WHEN I HEARD AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY</H2></CENTER>

W<FONT SIZE=-1>HEN</FONT> I heard at the close of the day how my name had

been

<BR>And else when I carous'd, or when my plans were

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accomplish'd, still I was not happy,

<BR>But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; health, refresh'd, singing, inhaling the ripe

breath of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; autumn,



<P>&nbsp;When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disappear in the morning light,

<BR>When I wander'd alone over the beach, and undressing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bathed, laughing with the cool waters, and

saw the sun

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rise,

<BR>And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; way coming, O then I was happy,

<BR>O then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nourish'd me more, and the beautiful day pass'd

well,

<BR>And the next came with equal joy, and with the next at

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evening came my friend,

<BR>And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continually up the shores,

<BR>I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to me whispering to congratulate me,

<BR>For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cover in the cool night,

<BR>In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inclined toward me,

<BR>And his arm lay lightly around my breast&amp;emdash;and that night

I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was happy.

I <FONT SIZE=-1>SAW</FONT> in Louisiana a live-oak growing,

<BR>All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches,

<BR>Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous leaves

<BR>And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of

<BR>But I wonder'd how it could utter joyous leaves standing

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alone there without its friend near, for I

knew I could not,

<BR>And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and twined around it a little moss,

<BR>And brought it away, and I have placed it in sight, in my room,

<BR>It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,

<BR>(For I believe lately I think of little else than of them,)

<BR>Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of

<BR>Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near,

<BR>I know very well I could not.

THIS MOMENT YEARNING AND THOUGHTFUL</H2></CENTER>

T<FONT SIZE=-1>HIS</FONT> moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone,

<BR>It seems to me there are other men in other lands yearning

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and thoughtful,

<BR>It seems to me I can look over and behold them in Germany,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Italy, France, Spain,

<BR>Or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or Japan, talking

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other dialects,

<BR>And it seems to me if I could know those men I should become

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attached to them as I do to men in my own

lands,

<BR>O I know we should be brethren and lovers,

<BR>I know I should be happy with them.

<BR>Without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument,

<BR>The institution of the dear love of comrades.

Piety and conformity to them that like,

<BR>Peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like,

<BR>I am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations,

<BR>Crying, Leap from your seats and contend for your lives!



<P>&nbsp;I am he who walks the States with a barb'd tongue,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; questioning every one I meet,

<BR>Who are you that wanted only to be told what you knew

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before?

<BR>Who are you that wanted only a book to join you in your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nonsense?

<BR>(With pangs and cries as thine own O bearer of many

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; children,

<BR>These clamors wild to a race of pride I give.)

<BR>O lands, would you be freer than all that has ever been

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before?

<BR>If you would be freer than all that has been before, come

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; listen to me.



<P>&nbsp;Fear grace, elegance, civilization, delicatesse,

<BR>Fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey-juice,

<BR>Beware the advancing mortal ripening of Nature,

<BR>Beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and men.

Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials,

<BR>America brings builders, and brings its own styles.



<P>&nbsp;The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work and pass'd to other spheres,

<BR>A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.



<P>&nbsp;America, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own at all hazards,

<BR>Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound, initiates the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; true use of precedents,

<BR>Does not repel them or the past or what they have produced

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under their forms,

<BR>Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; borne from the house,

<BR>Perceives that it waits a little while in the door, that it was

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fittest for its days,

<BR>That its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heir who approaches,

<BR>And that he shall be fittest for his days.



<P>&nbsp;Any period one nation must lead,

<BR>One land must be the promise and reliance of the future.



<P>&nbsp;These States are the amplest poem,

<BR>Here is not merely a nation but a teeming Nation of nations,

<BR>Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doings of the day and night,



<P>&nbsp;Here is what moves in magnificent masses careless of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; particulars,

<BR>Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soul loves,

<BR>Here the flowing trains, here the crowds, equality, diversity,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the soul loves.

Land of lands and bards to corroborate!

<BR>Of them standing among them, one lifts to the light a west-

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bred face,

<BR>To him the hereditary countenance bequeath'd both mother's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and father's,

<BR>His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,

<BR>Built of the common stock, having room for far and near,

<BR>Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,

<BR>Attracting it body and soul to himself, hanging on its neck

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with incomparable love,

<BR>Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,

<BR>Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in him,

<BR>Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,

<BR>Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes, Columbia,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Niagara, Hudson, spending themselves lovingly

in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him,

<BR>If the Atlantic coast stretch or the Pacific coast stretch, he

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stretching with them North or South,

<BR>Spanning between them East and West, and touching whatever

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is between them,

<BR>Growths growing from him to offset the growths of pine,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cedar, hemlock, live-oak, locust, chestnut,

hickory,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cottonwood, orange, magnolia,

<BR>Tangles as tangled in him as any cranebake or swamp,

<BR>He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with northern transparent ice,

<BR>Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savanna, upland,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prairie,

<BR>Through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fish-hawk, mocking-bird, night-heron, and

eagle,



<P>&nbsp;His spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed to good

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and evil,

<BR>Surrounding the essences of real things, old times and pre

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sent times,

<BR>Surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aborigines,

<BR>Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stature and muscle,

<BR>The haughty defiance of the Year One, war, peace, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; formation of the Constitution,

<BR>The separate States, the simple elastic scheme, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; immigrants,

<BR>The Union always swarming with blatherers and always sure

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and impregnable,

<BR>The unsurvey'd interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hunters, trappers,

<BR>Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gestation of new States,

<BR>Congress convening every Twelfth-month, the members duly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coming up from the uttermost parts,

<BR>Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; especially the young men,

<BR>Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gait they have of persons who never knew

how it felt to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stand in the presence of superiors,

<BR>The freshness and candor of their physiognomy,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the copiousness and decision of their phrenology,

<BR>The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when wrong'd,

<BR>The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good temper and open-handedness, the whole

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; composite make,

<BR>The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amativeness,

<BR>The perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; movement of the population,

<BR>The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; golddigging,

<BR>Wharf-hemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intersecting all points,

<BR>Factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Northeast, Northwest, Southwest,

<BR>Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life,

<BR>Slavery&amp;emdash;the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon the ruins of all the rest,

<BR>On and on to the grapple with it&amp;emdash;Assassin! then your life

or

(Lo, high toward heaven, this day,

<BR>I mark the new aureola around your head,

<BR>No more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,

<BR>With war's flames and the lambent lightings playing,

<BR>And your port immovable where you stand,

<BR>With still the inextinguishable glance and the clinch'd and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lifted fist,

<BR>And your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; utterly crush'd beneath you,

<BR>The menacing arrogant one that strode and advanced with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his senseless scorn, bearing the murderous

knife,

<BR>The wide-swelling one, the braggart that would yesterday do

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so much,

<BR>To-day a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all the

I listened to the Phantom by Ontario's shore,

<BR>I heard the voice arising demanding bards,

<BR>By them all native and grand, by them alone can these States

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be fused into the compact organism of a Nation.



<P>&nbsp;To hold men together by paper and seal or by compulsion is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no account,

<BR>That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; principle, as the hold of the limbs of the

body or the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fibres of plants.



<P>&nbsp;Of all races and eras these States with veins full of poetica

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff most need poets, and are to have the

greatest, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use them the greatest,

<BR>Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as their poets shall.



<P>&nbsp;(Soul of love and tongue of fire!

<BR>Eye to pierce the deepest deeps and sweep the world!

<BR>Ah Mother, prolific and full in all besides, yet how long

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; barren, barren?)



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>10</CENTER>

Of these States the poet is the equable man,

<BR>Not in him but off from him things are grotesque, eccentric,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fail of their full returns,

<BR>Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,

<BR>He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither more nor less,

<BR>He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,

<BR>He is the equalizer of his age and land,

<BR>He supplies what wants supplying, he checks what wants

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; checking,



<P>&nbsp;In peace out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thrifty, building populous towns, encouraging

agriculture,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arts, commerce, lighting the study of man,

the soul,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; health, immortality, government,

<BR>In war he is the best backer of the war, he fetches artillery

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as good as the engineer's, he can make every

word he

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speaks draw blood,

<BR>The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steady faith,

<BR>He is no arguer, he is judgment, (Nature accepts him

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; absolutely,)

<BR>He judges not as the judge judges but as the sun falling round

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a helpless thing,

<BR>As he sees the farthest he has the most faith,

<BR>His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,

<BR>In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,

<BR>He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; denouement,

<BR>He sees eternity in men and women, he does not see men and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women as dreams or dots.



<P>&nbsp;For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,

<BR>For that, the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,

<BR>The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; despots.



<P>&nbsp;Without extinction is Liberty, without retrograde is Equality,

<BR>They live in the feelings of young men and the best women,

<BR>(Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been always ready to fall for Liberty.)



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>11</CENTER>

For the great Idea,

<BR>That, O my brethren, that is the mission of poets.



<P>&nbsp;Songs of stern defiance ever ready,

<BR>Songs of the rapid arming and the march,

<BR>The flag of peace quick-folded, and instead the flag we know,

<BR>Warlike flag of the great Idea.



<P>&nbsp;(Angry cloth I saw there leaping!

<BR>I stand again in leaden rain your flapping folds saluting,

<BR>I sing you over all, flying beckoning through the fight&amp;emdash;O

the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hard-contested fight!

<BR>The cannons ope their rosy-flashing muzzles&amp;emdash;the hurtled

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; balls scream,

<BR>The battle-front forms amid the smoke&amp;emdash;the volleys pour

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incessant from the line,

<BR>Hark, the ringing word <I>Charge</I>!&amp;emdash;now the tussle and

the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; furious maddening yells,

<BR>Now the corpses tumble curl'd upon the ground,

<BR>Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,

<BR>Angry cloth I saw there leaping.)

Are you he who would assume a place to teach or be a poet

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; here in the States?

<BR>The place is august, the terms obdurate.



<P>&nbsp;Who would assume to teach here may well prepare himself

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; body and mind,

<BR>He may well survey, ponder, arm, fortify, harden, make lithe

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; himself,

<BR>He shall surely be question'd beforehand by me with many

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and stern questions.



<P>&nbsp;Who are you indeed who would talk or sing to America?

<BR>Have you studied out the land, its idioms and men?

<BR>Have you learn'd the physiology, phrenology, politics,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; geography, pride, freedom, friendship of the

land? its

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; substratums and objects?

<BR>Have you consider'd the organic compact of the first day of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the first year of Independence, sign'd by the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commissioners, ratified by the States, and

read by Washington

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the head of the army?

<BR>Have you possess'd yourself of the Federal Constitution?

<BR>Do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behind them, and assumed the poems and processes

of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Democracy?



<P>&nbsp;Are you faithful to things? do you teach what the land and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sea, the bodies of men, womanhood, amativeness,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heroic angers, teach?

<BR>Have you sped through fleeting customs, popularities?

<BR>Can you hold your hand against all seductions, follies, whirls,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fierce contentions? are you very strong? are

you really of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole People?

<BR>Are you not of some coterie? some school or mere religion?

<BR>Are you done with reviews and criticisms of life? animating

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now to life itself?

<BR>Have you vivified yourself from the maternity of these States?

<BR>Have you too the old ever-fresh forbearance and impartiality?

<BR>Do you hold the like love for those hardening to maturity?

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the last-born? little and big? and for

the errant?



<P>&nbsp;What is this you bring my America?

<BR>Is it uniform with my country?

<BR>Is it not something that has been better told or done before?

<BR>Have you not imported this or the spirit of it in some ship?

<BR>Is it not a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness?&amp;emdash;is the good

old

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cause in it?

<BR>Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; literats, of enemies' lands?

<BR>Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here?

<BR>Does it answer universal needs? will it improve manners?

<BR>Does it sound with trumpet-voice the proud victory of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Union in that secession war?

<BR>Can your performance face the open fields and the seaside?

<BR>Will it absorb into me as I absorb food, air, to appear again

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in my strength, gait, face?

<BR>Have real employments contributed to it? original makers,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not mere amanuenses?

<BR>Does it meet modern discoveries, calibres, facts, face to face?

<BR>What does it mean to American persons, progresses, cities?

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chicago, Kanada, Arkansas?

<BR>Does it see behind the apparent custodians the real custodians

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; standing, menacing, silent, the mechanics,

Manhattanese,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Western men, Southerners, significant alike

in their apathy,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and in the promptness of their love?



<P>&nbsp;Does it see what finally befalls, and has always finally

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; befallen, each temporizer, patcher, outsider,

partialist, alarmist,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infidel, who has ever ask'd any thing of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America?

<BR>What mocking and scornful negligence?

<BR>The track strew'd with the dust of skeletons,

<BR>By the roadside others disdainfully toss'd.

Rhymes and rhymers pass away, poems distill'd from poems

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pass away,

<BR>The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and leave ashes,

<BR>Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make but the soil of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; literature,

<BR>America justifies itself, give it time, no disguise can deceive it

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or conceal from it, it is impassive enough,

<BR>Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them,

<BR>If its poets appear it will in due time advance to meet them,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is no fear of mistake,

<BR>(The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd till his country

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb'd

it.)



<P>&nbsp;He masters whose spirit masters, he tastes sweetest who

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; results sweetest in the long run,

<BR>The blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint;

<BR>In the need of songs, philosophy, an appropriate native

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grand-opera, shipcraft, any craft,

<BR>He or she is greatest who contributes the greatest original

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; practical example.



<P>&nbsp;Already a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, appears on

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the streets,

<BR>People's lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knowers,

<BR>There will shortly be no more priests, I say their work is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done,

<BR>Death is without emergencies here, but life is perpetual

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; emergencies here,

<BR>Are your body, days, manners, superb? after death you shall

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be superb,

<BR>Justice, health, self-esteem, clear the way with irresistible

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; power;

<BR>How dare you place any thing before a man?

<BR>I have loved the earth, sun, animals, I have despised riches,

<BR>I have given alms to every one that ask'd, stood up for the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stupid and crazy, devoted my income and labor

to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; others,

<BR>Hated tyrants, argued not concerning God, had patience and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indulgence toward the people, taken off my

hat to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing known or unknown,

<BR>Gone freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with the mothers of families,

<BR>Read these leaves to myself in the open air, tried them by

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trees, stars, rivers,

<BR>Dismiss'd whatever insulted my own soul or defiled my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; body,

<BR>Claim'd nothing to myself which I have not carefully claim'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for others on the same terms,

<BR>Sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every state,

<BR>(Upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean'd to breathe

<BR>This arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish'd, rais'd,

<BR>It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theories,

<BR>Through poems, pageants, shows, to form individuals.



<P>&nbsp;Underneath all, individuals,

<BR>I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals,

<BR>The American compact is altogether with individuals,

<BR>The only government is that which makes minute of

<BR>The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one

<P>&nbsp;Underneath all is the Expression of love for men and women,

<BR>(I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expressing love for men and women,

<BR>After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for

<P>&nbsp;Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments,

<BR>Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all.



<P>&nbsp;I will not be outfaced by irrational things,

<BR>I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me,

<BR>I will make cities and civilizations defer to me,

<BR>This is what I have learnt from America&amp;emdash;it is the amount,

I will confront these shows of the day and night,

<BR>I will know if I am to be less than they,

<BR>I will see if I am not as majestic as they,

<BR>I will see if I am to be less generous than they,

<BR>I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have meaning,

<BR>I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I am not to be enough for myself.



<P>&nbsp;I match my spirit against yours you orbs, growths, mountains,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brutes,

<BR>Copious as you are I absorb you all in myself, and become

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the master myself,

<BR>America isolated yet embodying all, what is it finally except

<BR>These States, what are they except myself?



<P>&nbsp;I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked, it is

<BR>I take you specially to be mine, you terrible, rude forms.

go on.)

Thus by blue Ontario's shore,

<BR>While the winds fann'd me and the waves came trooping

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toward me,

<BR>I thrill'd with the power's pulsations, and the charm of my

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theme was upon me,

<BR>Till the tissues that held me parted their ties upon me.



<P>&nbsp;And I saw the free souls of poets,

<BR>The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me,

<BR>Strange large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to me.

O my rapt verse, my call, mock me not!

<BR>Not for the bards of the past, not to invoke them have I

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launch'd you forth,

<BR>Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario's shores,

<BR>Have I sung so capricious and loud my savage song.



<P>&nbsp;Bards for my own land only I invoke,

<BR>(For the war, the war is over, the field is clear'd,)

<BR>Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; onward,

<BR>To cheer O Mother your boundless expectant soul.



<P>&nbsp;Bards of the great Idea! bards of the peaceful inventions!

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (for the war, the war is over!)

<BR>Yet bards of latent armies, a million soldiers waiting

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everready,

<BR>Bards with songs as from burning coals or the lightning's

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fork'd stripes!

<BR>Ample Ohio's, Kanada's bards&amp;emdash;bards of California! inland

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bards&amp;emdash;bards of the war!

<BR>You by my charm I invoke.

<BR>Amid the wilds, the rocks, the storm and wintry

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; night,

<BR>To me such misty, strange tableaux the syllables

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calling up;

<BR>Yonnondio&amp;emdash;I see, far in the west or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; north, a limitless ravine, with plains and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mountains dark,

<BR>I see swarms of stalwart chieftains, medicine-men,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and warriors,

<BR>As flitting by like clouds of ghosts, they pass and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are gone in the twilight,

<BR>(Race of the woods, the landscapes free, and the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; falls!

<BR>No picture, poem, statement, passing them to the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; future:)

<BR>Yonnondio! Yonnondio!&amp;emdash;unlimn'd they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disappear;

<BR>To-day gives place, and fades&amp;emdash;the cities,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; farms, factories fade;

<BR>A muffled sonorous sound, a wailing word is borne

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through the air for a moment,

<BR>Then blank and gone and still, and utterly lost.

<CENTER>OUT OF THE CRADLE ENDLESSLY ROCKING</CENTER>



<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>



<CENTER></CENTER>

O<FONT SIZE=-1>ut</FONT> of the cradle endlessly rocking,

<BR>Out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,

<BR>Out of the Ninth-month midnight,

<BR>Over the sterile sands and the fields beyond, where the child

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaving his bed wander'd alone, bareheaded,

barefoot,

<BR>Down from the shower'd halo,

<BR>Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were alive,

<BR>Out from the patches of briers and blackberries,

<BR>From the memories of the bird that chanted to me,

<BR>From your memories sad brother, from the fitful risings and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fallings I heard,

<BR>From under that yellow half-moon late-risen and swollen as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if with tears,

<BR>From those beginning notes of yearning and love there in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mist,

<BR>From the thousand responses of my heart never to cease,

<BR>From the myriad thence-arous'd words,

<BR>From the word stronger and more delicious than any,

<BR>From such as now they start the scene revisiting,

<BR>As a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,

<BR>Borne hither, ere all eludes me, hurriedly,

<BR>A man, yet by these tears a little boy again,

<BR>Throwing myself on the sand, confronting the waves,

<BR>I, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter,

<BR>Taking all hints to use them, but swiftly leaping beyond them,

<BR>A reminiscence sing.



<P>&nbsp;Once Paumanok,

<BR>When the lilac-scent was in the air and Fifth-month grass

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was growing,

<BR>Up this seashore in some briers,

<BR>Two feather'd guests from Alabama, two together,

<BR>And their nest, and four light-green eggs spotted with brown,

<BR>And every day the he-bird to and fro near at hand,

<BR>And every day the she-bird crouch'd on her nest, silent, with

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bright eyes,

<BR>And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disturbing them,

<BR>Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Shine! shine! shine</I>!

<BR><I>Pour down your warmth, great sun</I>!

<BR><I>While we bask, we two together</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Two together</I>!

<BR><I>Winds blow south, or winds blow north</I>,

<BR><I>Day come white, or night come black</I>,

<BR><I>Home, or rivers and mountains from home</I>,

<BR><I>Singing all time, minding no time</I>,

<BR><I>While we two keep together</I>.



<P>&nbsp;Till of a sudden,

<BR>May-be kill'd, unknown to her mate,

<BR>One forenoon the she-bird crouch'd not on the nest,

<BR>Nor return'd that afternoon, nor the next,

<BR>Nor ever appear'd again.



<P>&nbsp;And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea,

<BR>And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather,

<BR>Over the hoarse surging of the sea,

<BR>Or flitting from brier by day,

<BR>I saw, I heard at intervals the remaining one, the he-bird,

<BR>The solitary guest from Alabama.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Blow! blow! blow</I>!

<BR><I>Blow up sea-winds along Paumanok's shore</I>;

<BR><I>I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me</I>.



<P>&nbsp;Yes, when the stars glisten'd,

<BR>All night long on the prong of a moss-scallop'd stake,

<BR>Down almost amid the slapping waves,

<BR>Sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears.



<P>&nbsp;He call'd on his mate,

<BR>He pour'd forth the meanings which I of all men know.



<P>&nbsp;Yes my brother I know,

<BR>The rest might not, but I have treasur'd every note,

<BR>For more than once dimly down to the beach gliding,

<BR>Silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shadows,

<BR>Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sights after their sorts,

<BR>The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing,

<BR>I, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,

<BR>Listen'd long and long.



<P>&nbsp;Listen'd to keep, to sing, now translating the notes,

<BR>Following you my brother.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Soothe! soothe! soothe</I>!

<BR><I>Close on its wave soothes the wave behind</I>,

<BR><I>And again another behind embracing and lapping, every one close</I>,

<BR><I>But my love soothes not me, not me</I>.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P><I>Low hangs the moon, it rose late</I>,

<BR><I>It is lagging &amp;emdash; O I think it is heavy with love, with

love</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>O madly the sea pushes upon the land</I>,

<BR><I>With love, with love</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>O night! do I not see my love fluttering out among the</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breakers</I>?

<BR><I>What is that little black thing I see there in the white</I>?



<P>&nbsp;<I>Loud! loud! loud</I>!

<BR><I>Loud I call to you, my love</I>!

<BR><I>High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves</I>,

<BR><I>Surely you must know who is here, is here</I>,

<BR><I>You must know who I am, my love</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Low-hanging moon</I>!

<BR><I>What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow</I>?

<BR><I>O it is the shape, the shape of my mate</I>!

<BR><I>O moon do not keep her from me any longer</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Land! land! O land</I>!

<BR><I>Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back again if you only would</I>,

<BR><I>For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>O rising stars</I>!

<BR><I>Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with some</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of you</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>O throat! O trembling throat</I>!

<BR><I>Sound clearer through the atmosphere</I>!

<BR><I>Pierce the woods, the earth</I>,

<BR><I>Somewhere listening to catch you must be the one I want</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Shake out carols</I>!

<BR><I>Solitary here, the night's carols</I>!

<BR><I>Carols of lonesome love! death's carols</I>!

<BR><I>Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon</I>!

<BR><I>O under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea</I>!

<BR><I>O reckless despairing carols</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>But soft! sink low</I>!

<BR><I>Soft! let me just murmur</I>,

<BR><I>And do you wait a moment you husky-nois'd sea</I>,

<BR><I>For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me</I>,

<BR><I>So faint, I must be still, be still to listen</I>,

<BR><I>But not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately</I>

<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to me</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Hither my love</I>!

<BR><I>Here I am! here</I>!

<BR><I>With this just-sustain'd note I announce myself to you</I>,

<BR><I>This gentle call is for you my love, for you</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>Do not be decoy'd elsewhere</I>,

<BR><I>That is the whistle of the wind, it is not my voice</I>,

<BR><I>That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray</I>,

<BR><I>Those are the shadows of leaves</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>O darkness! O in vain</I>!

<BR><I>O I am very sick and sorrowful</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>O brown halo in the sky near the moon, drooping upon the sea</I>!

<BR><I>O troubled reflection in the sea</I>!

<BR><I>O throat! O throbbing heart</I>!

<BR><I>And I singing uselessly, uselessly all the night</I>.



<P>&nbsp;<I>O past! O happy life! O songs of joy</I>!

<BR><I>In the air, in the woods, over fields</I>,

<BR><I>Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved</I>!

<BR><I>But my mate no more, no more with me</I>!

<BR><I>We two together no more</I>.



<P>&nbsp;The aria sinking,

<BR>All else continuing, the stars shining,

<BR>The winds blowing, the notes of the bird continuous echoing,

<BR>With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning,

<BR>On the sands of Paumanok's shore gray and rustling,

<BR>The yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; face of the sea almost touching,

<BR>The boy ecstatic, with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; atmosphere dallying,

<BR>The love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tumultuously bursting,

<BR>The aria's meaning, the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing,

<BR>The strange tears down the cheeks coursing,

<BR>The colloquy there, the trio, each uttering,

<BR>The undertone, the savage old mother incessantly crying,

<BR>To the boy's soul's questions sullenly timing, some drown'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; secret hissing,

<BR>To the outsetting bard.



<P>&nbsp;Demon or bird! (said the boy's soul,)

<BR>Is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it really to me?

<BR>For I, that was a child, my tongue's use sleeping, now I have

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heard you,

<BR>Now in a moment I know what I am for, I awake,

<BR>And already a thousand singers, a thousand songs, clearer,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; louder and more sorrowful than yours,

<BR>A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; never to die.



<P>&nbsp;O you singer solitary, singing by yourself, projecting me,

<BR>O solitary me listening, never more shall I cease perpetuating

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you,

<BR>Never more shall I escape, never more the reverberations,

<BR>Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,

<BR>Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what there in the night,

<BR>By the sea under the yellow and sagging moon,

<BR>The messenger there arous'd, the fire, the sweet hell within,

<BR>The unknown want, the destiny of me.



<P>&nbsp;O give me the clew! (it lurks in the night here somewhere,)

<BR>O if I am to have so much, let me have more!



<P>&nbsp;A word then, (for I will conquer it,)

<BR>The word final, superior to all,

<BR>Subtle, sent up &amp;emdash; what is it? &amp;emdash; I listen;

<BR>Are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waves?

<BR>Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?

<BR>Whereto answering, the sea,

<BR>Delaying not, hurrying not,

<BR>Whisper'd me through the night, and very plainly before

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; daybreak,

<BR>Lisp'd to me the low and delicious word death,

<BR>And again death, death, death, death,

<BR>Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; child's heart,

<BR>But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet,

<BR>Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all over,

<BR>Death, death, death, death, death.



<P>&nbsp;Which I do not forget,

<BR>But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,

<BR>That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok's gray

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beach,

<BR>With the thousand responsive songs at random,

<BR>My own songs awaked from that hour,

<BR>And with them the key, the word up from the waves,

<BR>The word of the sweetest song and all songs,

<BR>That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,

<BR>(Or like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; garments, bending aside,)

<BR>The sea whisper'd me.

<CENTER></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>

As I ebb'd with the ocean of life,

<BR>As I wended the shores I know,

<BR>As I walk'd where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok,

<BR>Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant,

<BR>Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways,

<BR>I musing late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,

<BR>Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poems,

<BR>Was seiz'd by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot,

<BR>The rim, the sediment that stands for all the water and all the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; land of the globe.



<P>&nbsp;Fascinated, my eyes reverting from the south, dropt, to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; follow those slender windrows,

<BR>Chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten,

<BR>Scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the tide,

<BR>Miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,

<BR>Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; likenesses,

<BR>These you presented to me you fish-shaped island,

<BR>As I wended the shores I know,

<BR>As I walk'd with that electric self seeking types.

As I wend to the shores I know not,

<BR>As I list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wreck'd,

<BR>As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me,

<BR>As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer,

<BR>I too but signify at the utmost a little wash'd-up drift,

<BR>A few sands and dead leaves to gather,

<BR>Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift.



<P>&nbsp;O baffled, balk'd, bent to the very earth,

<BR>Oppress'd with myself that I have dared to open my mouth,

<BR>Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me I have not once had the least idea who

or what I am,

<BR>But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untouch'd, untold, altogether unreach'd,

<BR>Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bows,

<BR>With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written,

<BR>Pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beneath.

<BR>I perceive I have not really understood any thing, not a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; single object, and that no man ever can,

<BR>Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon me and sting me,

<BR>Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all.

You oceans both, I close with you,

<BR>We murmur alike reproachfully rolling sands and drift,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knowing not why,

<BR>These little shreds indeed standing for you and me and all.



<P>&nbsp;You friable shore with trails of debris,

<BR>You fish-shaped island, I take what is underfoot,

<BR>What is yours is mine my father.



<P>&nbsp;I too Paumanok,

<BR>I too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been wash'd on your shores,

<BR>I too am but a trail of drift and debris,

<BR>I too leave little wrecks upon you, you fish-shaped island.



<P>&nbsp;I throw myself upon your breast my father,

<BR>I cling to you so that you cannot unloose me,

<BR>I hold you so firm till you answer me something.



<P>&nbsp;Kiss me my father,

<BR>Touch me with your lips as I touch those I love,

<BR>Breathe to me while I hold you close the secret of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; murmuring I envy.

AMBITION</H2></CENTER>

O<FONT SIZE=-1>ne</FONT> day an obscure youth, a wanderer,

<BR>Known but to few, lay musing with himself

<BR>About the chances of his future life.

<BR>In that youth's heart, there dwelt the coal Ambition,

<BR>Burning and glowing; and he asked himself,

<BR>"Shall I, in time to come, be great and famed?"

<BR>Now soon an answer wild and mystical

<BR>Seemed to sound forth from out the depths of air;

<BR>And to the gazer's eye appeared a shape

<BR>Like one as of a cloud &amp;emdash; and thus it spoke:



<P>&nbsp;"O, many a panting, noble heart

<BR>Cherishes in its deep recess

<BR>The hope to win renown o'er earth

<BR>From Glory's prized caress.



<P>&nbsp;"And some will win that envied goal,

<BR>And have their deeds known far and wide;

<BR>And some &amp;emdash; by far the most &amp;emdash; will sink

<BR>Down in oblivion's tide.



<P>&nbsp;"But <I>thou</I>, who visions bright dost cull

<BR>From the imagination's store,

<BR>With dreams, such as the youthful dream

<BR>Of grandeur, love, and power,



<P>&nbsp;"Fanciest that thou shalt build a name

<BR>And come to have the nations know

<BR>What conscious might dwells in the brain

<BR>That throbs beneath that brow?



<P>&nbsp;"And see thick countless ranks of men

<BR>Fix upon <I>thee</I> their reverent gaze &amp;emdash;

<BR>And listen to the plaudits loud

<BR>To <I>thee</I> that thousands raise?



<P>&nbsp;"Weak, childish soul! the very place

<BR>That pride has made for folly's rest;

<BR>What thoughts, with vanity all rife,

<BR>Fill up thy heaving breast!



<P>&nbsp;"At night, go view the solemn stars

<BR>Those wheeling worlds through time the same &amp;emdash;

<BR>How puny seem the widest power,

<BR>The proudest mortal name!



<P>&nbsp;"Think too, that all, lowly and rich,

<BR>Dull idiot mind and teeming sense,

<BR>Alike must sleep the endless sleep,

<BR>A hundred seasons hence.



<P>&nbsp;"So, frail one, never more repine,

<BR>Though thou livest on obscure, unknown;

<BR>Though after death unsought may be

<BR>Thy markless resting stone."



<P>&nbsp;And as these accents dropped in the youth's ears,

<BR>He felt him sick at heart; for many a month

<BR>His fancy had amused and charmed itself

<BR>With lofty aspirations, visions fair

<BR>Of what he <I>might be</I>. And it pierced him sore

<BR>To have his airy castles thus dashed down.

<P>O<FONT SIZE=-1>f</FONT> olden time, when it came to pass

<BR>That the beautiful god, Jesus, should finish his work on earth

<BR>Then went Judas, and sold the divine youth,

<BR>And took pay for his body.



<P>&nbsp;Curs'd was the deed, even before the sweat of the clutching

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand grew dry;

<BR>And darkness frown'd upon the seller of the like of God,

<BR>Where, as though earth lifted her breast to throw him from

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her, and heaven refused him,

<BR>He hung in the air, self-slaughter'd.



<P>&nbsp;The cycles, with their long shadows, have stalk'd silently

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forward,

<BR>Since those ancient days &amp;emdash; many a pouch enwrapping mean

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while

<BR>Its fee, like that paid for the son of Mary.



<P>&nbsp;And still goes one, saying,

<BR>"What will ye give me, and I will deliver this man unto

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you?"

<BR>And they make the covenant, and pay the pieces of silver.

<BR>Bruised, bloody, and pinion'd is thy body,

<BR>More sorrowful than death is thy soul.



<P>&nbsp;Witness of anguish, brother of slaves,

<BR>Not with thy price closed the price of thine image:

<BR>And still Iscariot plies his trade.

RESURGEMUS</H2></CENTER>

S<FONT SIZE=-1>uddenly</FONT>, out of its stale and drowsy air, the air

of slaves,

<BR>Like lightning Europe le'pt forth,

<BR>Sombre, superb and terrible,

<BR>As Ahimoth, brother of Death.

<BR>God, 'twas delicious!

<BR>That brief, tight, glorious grip

<BR>Upon the throats of kings.

<BR>You liars paid to defile the People,



<P>&nbsp;Mark you now:

<BR>Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,

<BR>For court thieving in its manifold mean forms,

<BR>Worming from his simplicity the poor man's wages;

<BR>For many a promise sworn by royal lips

<BR>And broken, and laughed at in the breaking;

<BR>Then, in their power, not for all these,

<BR>Did a blow fall in personal revenge,

<BR>Or a hair draggle in blood:

<BR>The People scorned the ferocity of kings.



<P>&nbsp;But the sweetness of mercy brewed bitter destruction,

<BR>And frightened rulers come back:

<BR>Each comes in state, with his train,

<BR>Hangman, priest, and tax-gatherer,

<BR>Soldier, lawyer, and sycophant;

<BR>As appalling procession of locusts,

<BR>And the king struts grandly again.



<P>&nbsp;Yet behind all, lo, a Shape

<BR>Vague as the night, draped interminably,

<BR>Head, front and form, in scarlet folds,

<BR>Whose face and eyes none may see,

<BR>Out of its robes only this,

<BR>The red robes, lifted by the arm,

<BR>One finger pointed high over the top,

<BR>Like the head of a snake appears.



<P>&nbsp;Meanwhile, corpses lie in new-made graves,

<BR>Bloody corpses of young men;

<BR>The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily,

<BR>The bullets of tyrants are flying,

<BR>The creatures of power laugh aloud:

<BR>And all these things bear fruits, and they are good.



<P>&nbsp;Those corpses of young men,

<BR>Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets,

<BR>Those hearts pierced by the grey lead,

<BR>Cold and motionless as they seem,

<BR>Live elsewhere with undying vitality;

<BR>They live in other young men, O, kings,

<BR>They live in brothers, again ready to defy you;

<BR>They were purified by death,

<BR>They were taught and exalted.

<BR>Not a grave of those slaughtered ones,

<BR>But is growing its seed of freedom,

<BR>In its turn to bear seed,

<BR>Which the winds shall carry afar and resow,

<BR>And the rain nourish.

<BR>Not a disembodied spirit

<BR>Can the weapon of tyrants let loose,

<BR>But it shall stalk invisibly over the earth,

<BR>Whispering, counselling, cautioning.



<P>&nbsp;Liberty, let others despair of thee,

<BR>But I will never despair of thee:

<BR>Is the house shut? Is the master away?

<BR>Nevertheless, be ready, be not weary of watching,

<BR>He will surely return; his messengers come anon.

GREAT ARE THE MYTHS</H2></CENTER>



<CENTER>1</CENTER>





<P>G<FONT SIZE=-1>reat</FONT> are the myths &amp;emdash; I too delight

in them;

<BR>Great are Adam and Eve &amp;emdash; I too look back and accept them;

<BR>Great the risen and fallen nations, and their poets, women,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sages, inventors, rulers, warriors, and priests.



<P>&nbsp;Great is Liberty! great is Equality! I am their follower;

<BR>Helmsmen of nations, choose your craft! where you sail, I sail,

<BR>I weather it out with you, or sink with you.



<P>&nbsp;Great is Youth &amp;emdash; equally great is Old Age &amp;emdash;

great are the Day

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Night;

<BR>Great is Wealth &amp;emdash; great is Poverty &amp;emdash; great is

Expression &amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great is Silence.



<P>&nbsp;Youth, large, lusty, loving &amp;emdash; Youth, full of grace,

force,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fascination!

<BR>Do you know that Old Age may come after you, with equal

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grace, force, fascination?



<P>&nbsp;Day, full-blown and splendid &amp;emdash; Day of the immense sun,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; action, ambition, laughter,

<BR>The Night follows close, with millions of suns, and sleep, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restoring darkness.



<P>&nbsp;Wealth, with the flush hand, fine clothes, hospitality;

<BR>But then the Soul's wealth, which is candor, knowledge,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pride, enfolding love;

<BR>(Who goes for men and women showing Poverty richer than

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wealth?)



<P>&nbsp;Expression of speech! in what is written or said, forget not

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that Silence is also expressive,

<BR>That anguish as hot as the hottest, and contempt as cold as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the coldest, may be without words.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>2</CENTER>





<P>Great is the Earth, and the way it became what it is;

<BR>Do you imagine it has stopt at this? the increase aban

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don'd?

<BR>Understand then that it goes as far onward from this, as this

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is from the times when it lay in covering waters

and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gases, before man had appear'd.



<P>&nbsp;Great is the quality of Truth in man;

<BR>The quality of truth in man supports itself through all

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes,

<BR>It is inevitably in the man &amp;emdash; he and it are in love, and

never

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leave each other.



<P>&nbsp;The truth in man is no dictum, it is vital as eyesight;

<BR>If there be any Soul, there is truth &amp;emdash; if there be man or

woman

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is truth &amp;emdash; if there be physical

or moral, there is

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truth;

<BR>If there be equilibrium or volition, there is truth &amp;emdash; if

there be

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things at all upon the earth, there is truth.



<P>&nbsp;O truth of the earth! I am determin'd to press my way

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toward you;

<BR>Sound your voice! I scale mountains, or dive in the sea after

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>3</CENTER>





<P>Great is Language &amp;emdash; it is the mightiest of the sciences,

<BR>It is the fulness, color, form, diversity of the earth, and of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men and women, and of all qualities and processes;

<BR>It is greater than wealth &amp;emdash; it is greater than buildings,

ships,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; religions, paintings, music.



<P>&nbsp;Great is the English speech &amp;emdash; what speech is so great

as the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; English?

<BR>Great is the English brood &amp;emdash; what brood has so vast a

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destiny as the English?

<BR>It is the mother of the brood that must rule the earth with the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new rule;

<BR>The new rule shall rule as the Soul rules, and as the love,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; justice, equality in the Soul rule.



<P>&nbsp;Great is Law &amp;emdash; great are the few old land-marks of

the law,

<BR>They are the same in all times, and shall not be disturb'd.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>4</CENTER>





<P>Great is Justice!

<BR>Justice is not settled by legislators and laws &amp;emdash; it is in

the Soul;

<BR>It cannot be varied by statutes, any more than love, pride,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the attraction of gravity, can;

<BR>It is immutable &amp;emdash; it does not depend on majorities &amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; majorities or what not, come at last before the

same passionless

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and exact tribunal.



<P>&nbsp;For justice are the grand natural lawyers, and perfect judges

&amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is in their Souls;

<BR>It is well assorted &amp;emdash; they have not studied for nothing

&amp;emdash; the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great includes the less;

<BR>They rule on the highest grounds &amp;emdash; they oversee all eras,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; states, administrations.



<P>&nbsp;The perfect judge fears nothing &amp;emdash; he could go front

to front

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before God;

<BR>Before the perfect judge all shall stand back &amp;emdash; life and

death

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall stand back &amp;emdash; heaven and hell shall

stand back.



<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>5</CENTER>





<P>Great is Life, real and mystical, wherever and whoever;

<BR>Great is Death &amp;emdash; sure as life holds all parts together,

Death

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; holds all parts together.



<P>&nbsp;Has Life much purport? &amp;emdash; Ah, Death has the greatest

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purport.

POEM OF REMEMBRANCE FOR A GIRL OR A BOY OF THESE STATES</H2></CENTER>

Y<FONT SIZE=-1>ou</FONT> just maturing youth! You male or female!

<BR>Remember the organic compact of These States,

<BR>Remember the pledge of the Old Thirteen thenceforward to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the rights, life, liberty, equality of man,

<BR>Remember what was promulged by the founders, ratified by

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The States, signed in black and white by the Commissioners,

and read by Washington at the head of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; army,

<BR>Remember the purposes of the founders, &amp;emdash; Remember

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington;

<BR>Remember the copious humanity streaming from every

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; direction toward America;

<BR>Remember the hospitality that belongs to nations and men;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Cursed be nation, woman, man, without hospitality!)

<BR>Remember, government is to subserve individuals,



<P>&nbsp;Not any, not the President, is to have one jot more than you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or me,

<BR>Not any habitan of America is to have one jot less than you

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or me.



<P>&nbsp;Anticipate when the thirty or fifty millions, are to become the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hundred or two hundred millions, of equal freemen

and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freewomen, amicably joined.



<P>&nbsp;Recall ages &amp;emdash; One age is but a part &amp;emdash; ages

are but a part;

<BR>Recall the angers, bickerings, delusions, superstitions, of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; idea of caste,

<BR>Recall the bloody cruelties and crimes.



<P>&nbsp;Anticipate the best women;

<BR>I say an unnumbered new race of hardy and well-defined

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women are to spread through all These States,

<BR>I say a girl fit for These States must be free, capable,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dauntless, just the same as a boy.



<P>&nbsp;Anticipate your own life &amp;emdash; retract with merciless power,

<BR>Shirk nothing &amp;emdash; retract in time &amp;emdash; Do you see

those errors,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; diseases, weaknesses, lies, thefts?

<BR>Do you see that lost character? &amp;emdash; Do you see decay,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consumption, rum-drinking, dropsy, fever, mortal

cancer or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inflammation?

<BR>Do you see death, and the approach of death?

T<FONT SIZE=-1>hink</FONT> of the Soul;

<BR>I swear to you that body of yours gives proportions to your

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soul somehow to live in other spheres;

<BR>I do not know how, but I know it is so.



<P>&nbsp;Think of loving and being loved;

<BR>I swear to you, whoever you are, you can interfuse yourself

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with such things that everybody that sees you shall

look

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longingly upon you.

<BR>Think of the past;

<BR>I warn you that in a little while others will find their past in

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you and your times.



<P>&nbsp;The race is never separated &amp;emdash; nor man nor woman escapes;

<BR>All is inextricable &amp;emdash; things, spirits, Nature, nations,

you too &amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from precedents you come.



<P>&nbsp;Recall the ever-welcome defiers, (The mothers precede them;)

<BR>Recall the sages, poets, saviors, inventors, lawgivers, of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth;

<BR>Recall Christ, brother of rejected persons &amp;emdash; brother of

slaves,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; felons, idiots, and of insane and diseas'd persons.



<P>&nbsp;Think of the time when you were not yet born;

<BR>Think of times you stood at the side of the dying;

<BR>Think of the time when your own body will be dying.



<P>&nbsp;Think of spiritual results,

<BR>Sure as the earth swims through the heavens, does every one

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of its objects pass into spiritual results.



<P>&nbsp;Think of manhood, and you to be a man;

<BR>Do you count manhood, and the sweet of manhood, nothing?



<P>&nbsp;Think of womanhood, and you to be a woman;

<BR>The creation is womanhood;

<BR>Have I not said that womanhood involves all?

<I>Song of the Answerer</I></H1></CENTER>

Now list to my morning's romanza, I tell the signs of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answerer,

<BR>To the cities and farms I sing as they spread in the sunshine

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before me.



<P>&nbsp;A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother,

<BR>How shall the young man know the whether and when of his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brother?

<BR>Tell him to send me the signs.



<P>&nbsp;And I stand before the young man face to face, and take his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right hand in my left hand and his left hand

in my right hand,

<BR>And I answer for his brother and for men, and I answer for him

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that answers for all, and send these signs.



<P>&nbsp;Him all wait for, him all yield up to, his word is decisive

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and final,

<BR>Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves as

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amid light,

<BR>Him they immerse and he immerses them.



<P>&nbsp;Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people, animals,

<BR>The profound earth and its attributes and the unquiet ocean,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (so tell I my morning's romanza,)

<BR>All enjoyments and properties and money, and whatever money

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will buy,

<BR>The best farms, others toiling and planting and he unavoidably reaps,

<BR>The noblest and costliest cities, others grading and building and he

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; domiciles there,

<BR>Nothing for any one but what is for him, near and far are for him,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ships in the offing,

<BR>The perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are for anybody.



<P>&nbsp;He puts things in their attitudes,

<BR>He puts to-day out of himself with plasticity and love,

<BR>He places his own times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sisters, associations, employment, politics,

so that the rest

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; never shame them afterward, nor assume to

command them.



<P>&nbsp;He is the Answerer,

<BR>What can be answer'd he answers, and what cannot be answer'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he shows how it cannot be answer'd.



<P>&nbsp;A man is a summons and challenge,

<BR>(It is vain to skulk&amp;emdash;do you hear that mocking and laughter?

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do you hear the ironical echoes?)



<P>&nbsp;Books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pride, beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction,

<BR>He indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and down also.



<P>&nbsp;Whichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freshly and gently and safely by day or by

night,

<BR>He has the pass-key of hearts, to him the response of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prying of hands on the knobs.



<P>&nbsp;His welcome is universal, the flow of beauty is not more

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; welcome or universal than he is,

<BR>The person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed.



<P>&nbsp;Every existence has its idiom, every thing has an idiom and tongue,

<BR>He resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any man translates, and any man translates

himself also,

<BR>One part does not counteract another part, he is the joiner,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he sees how they join.



<P>&nbsp;He says indifferently and alike <I>How are you friend?</I> to

the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President at his levee,

<BR>And he says <I>Good-day my brother</I>, to Cudge that hoes in the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sugar-field,

<BR>And both understand him and know that his speech is right.



<P>&nbsp;He walks with perfect ease in the capitol,

<BR>He walks among the Congress, and one Representative says

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to another, <I>Here is our equal appearing

and new</I>.



<P>&nbsp;Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,

<BR>And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that he has follow'd the sea,

<BR>And the authors take him for an author, and the artists for

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an artist,

<BR>And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,

<BR>No matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it or

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has follow'd it,

<BR>No matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sisters there.



<P>&nbsp;The English believe he comes of their English stock,

<BR>A Jew to the Jew he seems, a Russ to the Russ, usual and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; near, removed from none.



<P>&nbsp;Whoever he looks at in the traveler's coffee-house claims him,

<BR>The Italian or Frenchman is sure, the German is sure, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spaniard is sure, and the island Cuban is

sure,



<P>&nbsp;The engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mississippi or St. Lawrence or Sacramento,

or Hudson

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or Paumanok sound, claims him.



<P>&nbsp;The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood,

<BR>The insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; themselves in the ways of him, he strangely

transmutes them,

<BR>They are not vile any more, they hardly know themselves they

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are so grown.

<P>The indications and tally of time,

<BR>Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs,

<BR>Time, always without break, indicates itself in parts,

<BR>What always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; company of singers, and their words,

<BR>The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or dark, but the words of the maker of poems

are the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; general light and dark,

<BR>The maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,

<BR>His insight and power encircle things and the human race,

<BR>He is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; human race.



<P>&nbsp;The singers do not beget, only the Poet begets,

<BR>The singers are welcom'd, understood, appear often enough,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but rare has the day been, likewise the spot,

of the birth

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the maker of poems, the Answerer,

<BR>(Not every century nor every five centuries has contain'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such a day, for all its names.)



<P>&nbsp;The singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; names, but the name of each of them is one

of the singers,

<BR>The name of each is, eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweet-singer, night-singer, parlor-singer,

love-singer,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weird-singer, or something else.



<P>&nbsp;All this time and at all times wait the words of true poems,

<BR>The words of true poems do not merely please,

<BR>The true poets are not followers of beauty but the august

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; masters of beauty;

<BR>The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mothers and fathers,

<BR>The words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; science.



<P>&nbsp;Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rudeness of body, withdrawnness,

<BR>Gayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness, such are some of the words

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of poems.



<P>&nbsp;The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems, the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answerer,

<BR>The builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all these underlie the maker of poems, the

Answerer.



<P>&nbsp;The words of the true poems give you more than poems,

<BR>They give you to form for yourself poems, religions, politics,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; war, peace, behavior, histories, essays, daily

life, and

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every thing else,

<BR>They balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes,

<BR>They do not seek beauty, they are sought,

<BR>Forever touching them or close upon them follows beauty,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longing, fain, love-sick.



<P>&nbsp;They prepare for death, yet they are not the finish, but rather

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the outset,

<BR>They bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full,

<BR>Whom they take they take into space to behold the birth of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stars, to learn one of the meanings,

<BR>To launch off with absolute faith, to sweep through the ceaseless

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rings and never be quiet again.
