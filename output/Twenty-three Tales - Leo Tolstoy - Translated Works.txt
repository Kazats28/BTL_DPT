<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THERE once lived, in the Government of Ouf&aacute; a Bashk&iacute;r

named Ily&aacute;s. His father, who died a year after he had found his

son a

<BR>wife, did not leave him much property. Ily&aacute;s then had only seven

mares, two cows, and about a score of sheep. He was a good

<BR>manager, however, and soon began to acquire more. He and his wife worked

from morn till night; rising earlier than others and

<BR>going later to bed; and his possessions increased year by year. Living

in this way, Ily&aacute;s little by little acquired great wealth. At the

<BR>end of thirty-five years he had 200 horses, 150 head of cattle, and

1,200 sheep. Hired labourers tended his flocks and herds, and

<BR>hired women milked his mares and cows, and made kumiss[17], butter

and cheese. Ily&aacute;s had abundance of everything, and every

<BR>one in the district envied him. They said of him:



<P>'Ily&aacute;s is a fortunate man: he has plenty of everything. This

world must be a pleasant place for him.'



<P>People of position heard of Ily&aacute;s and sought his acquaintance.

Visitors came to him from afar; and he welcomed every one, and

<BR>gave them food and drink. Whoever might come, there was always kumiss,

tea, sherbet, and mutton to set before them. Whenever

<BR>visitors arrived a sheep would be killed, or sometimes two; and if

many guests came he would even slaughter a mare for them.



<P>Ily&aacute;s had three children: two sons and a daughter; and he married

them all off. While he was poor, his sons worked with him, and

<BR>looked after the flocks and herds themselves; but when he grew rich

they got spoiled and one of them took to drink. The eldest

<BR>was killed in a brawl; and the younger, who had married a self-willed

woman, ceased to obey his father, and they could not live

<BR>together any more.



<P>So they parted, and Ily&aacute;s gave his son a house and some of the

cattle; and this diminished his wealth. Soon after that, a disease

<BR>broke out among Ily&aacute;s's sheep, and many died. Then followed

a bad harvest, and the hay crop failed; and many cattle died that

<BR>winter. Then the Kirgh&iacute;z captured his best herd of horses; and

Ily&aacute;s's property dwindled away. It became smaller and smaller,

<BR>while at the same time his strength grew less; till, by the time he

was seventy years old, he had begun to sell his furs, carpets,

<BR>saddles, and tents. At last he had to part with his remaining cattle,

and found himself face to face with want. Before he knew how

<BR>it had happened, he had lost everything, and in their old age he and

his wife had to go into service. Ily&aacute;s had nothing left, except

<BR>the clothes on his back, a fur cloak, a cup, his indoor shoes and overshoes,

and his wife, Sham-Shemagi, who also was old by this

<BR>time. The son who had parted from him had gone into a far country,

and his daughter was dead, so that there was no one to help

<BR>the old couple.



<P>Their neighbour, Muhammad-Shah, took pity on them. Muhammad-Shah was

neither rich nor poor, but lived comfortably, and was

<BR>a good man. He remembered Ily&aacute;s's hospitality, and pitying him,

said:



<P>'Come and live with me, Ily&aacute;s, you and your old woman. In summer

you can work in my melon-garden as much as your strength

<BR>allows, and in winter feed my cattle; and Sham-Shemagi shall milk my

mares and make kumiss. I will feed and clothe you both.

<BR>When you need anything, tell me, and you shall have it.'



<P>Ily&aacute;s thanked his neighbour, and he and his wife took service

with Muhammad-Shah as labourers. At first the position seemed

<BR>hard to them, but they got used to it, and lived on, working as much

as their strength allowed.



<P>Muhammad-Shah found it was to his advantage to keep such people, because,

having been masters themselves, they knew how to

<BR>manage and were not lazy, but did all the work they could. Yet it grieved

Muhammad-Shah to see people brought so low who had

<BR>been of such high standing.



<P>It happened once that some of Muhammad-Shah's relatives came from a

great distance to visit him, and a Mullah came too.

<BR>Muhammad-Shah told Ily&aacute;s to catch a sheep and kill it. Ily&aacute;s

skinned the sheep, and boiled it, and sent it in to the guests. The

<BR>guests ate the mutton, had some tea, and then began drinking kumiss.

As they were sitting with their host on down cushions on a

<BR>carpet, conversing and sipping kumiss from their cups, Ily&aacute;s,

having finished his work passed by the open door. Muhammad-Shah,

<BR>seeing him pass, said to one of the guests:



<P>'Did you notice that old man who passed just now?'



<P>'Yes,' said the visitor, 'what is there remarkable about him?'



<P>'Only this -- that he was once the richest man among us,' replied the

host. 'His name is Ily&aacute;s. You may have heard of him.'



<P>'Of course I have heard of him,' the guest answered 'I never saw him

before, but his fame has spread far and wide.'



<P>'Yes, and now he has nothing left,' said Muhammad-Shah, 'and he lives

with me as my labourer, and his old woman is here too --

<BR>she milks the mares.'



<P>The guest was astonished: he clicked with his tongue, shook his head,

and said:



<P>'Fortune turns like a wheel. One man it lifts, another it sets down!

Does not the old man grieve over all he has lost?'



<P>'Who can tell. He lives quietly and peacefully, and works well.'



<P>'May I speak to him?' asked the guest. 'I should like to ask him about

his life.'



<P>'Why not?' replied the master, and he called from the kib&iacute;tka[18]

in which they were sitting:



<P>'Babay;' (which in the Bashkir tongue means 'Grandfather ') 'come in

and have a cup of kumiss with us, and call your wife here

<BR>also.'



<P>Ily&aacute;s entered with his wife; and after exchanging greetings with

his master and the guests, he repeated a prayer, and seated

<BR>himself near the door. His wife passed in behind the curtain and sat

down with her mistress.



<P>A Cap of kumiss was handed to Ily&aacute;s; he wished the guests and

his master good health, bowed, drank a little, and put down the

<BR>cup.



<P>'Well, Daddy,' said the guest who had wished to speak to him, 'I suppose

you feel rather sad at the sight of us. It must remind you

<BR>of your former prosperity, and of your present sorrows.'



<P>Ily&aacute;s smiled, and said:



<P>'If I were to tell you what is happiness and what is misfortune, you

would not believe me. You had better ask my wife. She is a

<BR>woman, and what is in her heart is on her tongue. She will tell you

the whole truth.'



<P>The guest turned towards the curtain.



<P>'Well, Granny,' he cried, 'tell me how your former happiness compares

with your present misfortune.'



<P>And Sham-Shemagi answered from behind the curtain:



<P>'This is what I think about it: My old man and I lived for fifty years

seeking happiness and not finding it; and it is only now, these

<BR>last two years, since we had nothing left and have lived as labourers,

that we have found real happiness, and we wish for nothing

<BR>better than our present lot.'



<P>The guests were astonished, and so was the master; he even rose and

drew the curtain back, so as to see the old woman's face.

<BR>There she stood with her arms folded, looking at her old husband, and

smiling; and he smiled back at her. The old woman went on:



<P>'I speak the truth and do not jest. For half a century we sought for

happiness, and as long as we were rich we never found it. Now

<BR>that we have nothing left, and have taken service as labourers, we

have found such happiness that we want nothing better.'



<P>'But in what does your happiness consist?' asked the guest.



<P>'Why, in this,' she replied, 'when we were rich my husband and I had

so many cares that we had no time to talk to one another, or

<BR>to think of our souls, or to pray to God. Now we had visitors, and

had to consider what food to set before them, and what presents

<BR>to give them, lest they should speak ill of us. When they left, we

had to look after our labourers who were always trying to shirk

<BR>work and get the best food, while we wanted to get all we could out

of them. So we sinned. Then we were in fear lest a wolf

<BR>should kill a foal or a calf, or thieves steal our horses. We lay awake

at night, worrying lest the ewes should overlie their lambs,

<BR>and we got up again and again to see that all was well. One thing attended

to, another care would spring up: how, for instance, to

<BR>get enough fodder for the winter. And besides that, my old man and

I used to disagree. He would say we must do so and so, and I

<BR>would differ from him; and then we disputed -- sinning again. So we

passed from one trouble to another, from one sin to another,

<BR>and found no happiness.'



<P>'Well, and now?'



<P>'Now, when my husband and I wake in the morning, we always have a loving

word for one another and we live peacefully, having

<BR>nothing to quarrel about. We have no care but how best to serve our

master. We work as much as our strength allows and do it

<BR>with a will, that our master may not lose but profit by us. When we

come in, dinner or supper is ready and there is kumiss to drink.

<BR>We have fuel to burn when it is cold and we have our fur cloak. And

we have time to talk, time to think of our souls, and time to

<BR>pray. For fifty years we sought happiness, but only now at last have

we found it.'



<P>The guests laughed.



<P>But Ily&aacute;s said:



<P>'Do not laugh, friends. It is not a matter for jesting -- it is the

truth of life. We also were foolish at first, and wept at the loss of our

<BR>wealth; but now God has shown us the truth, and we tell it, not for

our own consolation, but for your good.'



<P>And the Mullah said:



<P>'That is a wise speech. Ily&aacute;s has spoken the exact truth. The

same is said in Holy Writ.'



<P>And the guests ceased laughing and became thoughtful.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>IN the town of Vlad&iacute;mir lived a young merchant named Iv&aacute;n

Dm&iacute;tritch Aksy&oacute;nof. He had two shops and a house of his own.



<P>Aksy&oacute;nof was a handsome, fair-haired, curly-headed fellow, full

of fun, and very fond of singing. When quite a young man he

<BR>had been given to drink, and was riotous when he had had too much,

but after he married he gave up drinking, except now and

<BR>then.



<P>One summer Aksy&oacute;nof was going to the N&iacute;zhny Fair, and

as he bade good-bye to his family his wife said to him, 'Iv&aacute;n

<BR>Dm&iacute;tritch, do not start to-day; I have had a bad dream about

you.'



<P>Aksy&oacute;nof laughed, and said, 'You are afraid that when I get to

the fair I shall go on the spree.'



<P>His wife replied: 'I do not know what I am afraid of; all I know is

that I had a bad dream. I dreamt you returned from the town,

<BR>and when you took off your cap I saw that your hair was quite grey.'



<P>Aksy&oacute;nof laughed. 'That's a lucky sign,' said he. 'See if I don't

sell out all my goods, and bring you some presents from the fair.'



<P>So he said good-bye to his family, and drove away.



<P>When he had travelled half-way, he met a merchant whom he knew, and

they put up at the same inn for the night. They had

<BR>some tea together, and then went to bed in adjoining rooms.



<P>It was not Aksy&oacute;nof's habit to sleep late, and, wishing to travel

while it was still cool, he aroused his driver before dawn, and

<BR>told him to put in the horses.



<P>Then he made his way across to the landlord of the inn (who lived in

a cottage at the back), paid his bill, and continued his

<BR>journey.



<P>When he had gone about twenty-five miles, he stopped for the horses

to be fed. Aksy&oacute;nof rested awhile in the passage of the

<BR>inn, then he stepped out into the porch and, ordering a samov&aacute;r[1]

to be heated got out his guitar and began to play.



<P>Suddenly a tr&oacute;yka[2] drove up with tinkling bells, and an official

alighted, followed by two soldiers. He came to Aksy&oacute;nof and

<BR>began to question him, asking him who he was and whence he came. Aksy&oacute;nof

answered him fully, and said, 'Won't you have

<BR>some tea with me?' But the official went on cross-questioning him and

asking him, 'Where did you spend last night? Were you

<BR>alone, or with a fellow-merchant? Did you see the other merchant this

morning? Why did you leave the inn before dawn?'



<P>Aksy&oacute;nof wondered why he was asked all these questions, but he

described all that had happened, and then added, 'Why do

<BR>you cross-question me as if I were a thief or a robber? I am travelling

on business of my own, and there is no need to question

<BR>me.'



<P>Then the official, calling the soldiers, said, 'I am the police-officer

of this district, and I question you because the merchant with

<BR>whom you spent last night has been found with his throat cut. We must

search your things.'



<P>They entered the house. The soldiers and the police-officer unstrapped

Aksy&oacute;nof's luggage and searched it. Suddenly the

<BR>officer drew a knife out of a bag, crying, 'Whose knife is this?'



<P>Aksy&oacute;nof looked, and seeing a blood-stained knife taken from

his bag, he was frightened.



<P>'How is it there is blood on this knife?'



<P>Aksy&oacute;nof tried to answer, but could hardly utter a word, and

only stammered: 'I -- I don't know -- not mine.'



<P>Then the police-officer said, 'This morning the merchant was found in

bed with his throat cut. You are the only person who

<BR>could have done it. The house was locked from inside, and no one else

was there. Here is this bloodstained knife in your bag,

<BR>and your face and manner betray you! Tell me how you killed him, and

how much money you stole?'



<P>Aksy&oacute;nof swore he had not done it; that he had not seen the merchant

after they had had tea together; that he had no money

<BR>except eight thousand roubles[3] of his own, and that the knife was

not his. But his voice was broken, his face pale, and he

<BR>trembled with fear as though he were guilty.



<P>The police-officer ordered the soldiers to bind Aksy&oacute;nof and

to put him in the cart. As they tied his feet together and flung him

<BR>into the cart, Aksy&oacute;nof crossed himself and wept. His money

and goods were taken from him, and he was sent to the nearest

<BR>town and imprisoned there. Enquiries as to his character were made

in Vlad&iacute;mir. The merchants and other inhabitants of that

<BR>town said that in former days he used to drink and waste his time,

but that he was a good man. Then the trial came on: he was

<BR>charged with murdering a merchant from Ryaz&aacute;n, and robbing him

of twenty thousand roubles.



<P>His wife was in despair, and did not know what to believe. Her children

were all quite small; one was a baby at her breast.

<BR>Taking them all with her, she went to the town where her husband was

in gaol. At first she was not allowed to see him; but,

<BR>after much begging, she obtained permission from the officials, and

was taken to him. When she saw her husband in

<BR>prison-dress and in chains, shut up with thieves and criminals, she

fell down, and did not come to her senses for a long time.

<BR>Then she drew her children to her, and sat down near him. She told

him of things at home, and asked about what had

<BR>happened to him. He told her all, and she asked, 'What can we do now?'



<P>'We must petition the Tsar not to let an innocent man perish.'



<P>His wife told him that she had sent a petition to the Tsar, but that

it had not been accepted.



<P>Aksy&oacute;nof did not reply, but only looked downcast.



<P>Then his wife said, 'It was not for nothing I dreamt your hair had turned

grey. You remember? You should not have started that

<BR>day.' And passing her fingers through his hair, she said: 'V&aacute;nya

dearest, tell your wife the truth; was it not you who did it?'



<P>'So you, too, suspect me!' said Aksy&oacute;nof, and hiding his face

in his hands, he began to weep. Then a soldier came to say that

<BR>the wife and children must go away; and Aksy&oacute;nof said good-bye

to his family for the last time.



<P>When they were gone, Aksy&oacute;nof recalled what had been said, and

when he remembered that his wife also had suspected him,

<BR>he said to himself, 'It seems that only God can know the truth, it

is to Him alone we must appeal, and from Him alone expect

<BR>mercy.'



<P>And Aksy&oacute;nof wrote no more petitions; gave up all hope, and only

prayed to God.



<P>Aksy&oacute;nof was condemned to be flogged and sent to the mines. So

he was flogged with a knout, and when the wounds made

<BR>by the knout were healed, he was driven to Siberia with other convicts.



<P>For twenty-six years Aksy&oacute;nof lived as a convict in Siberia.

His hair turned white as snow and his beard grew long, thin, and

<BR>grey. All his mirth went; he stooped; he walked slowly, spoke little,

and never laughed, but he often prayed.



<P>In prison Aksy&oacute;nof learnt to make boots, and earned a little

money, with which he bought The Lives of the Saints. He read

<BR>this book when there was light enough in the prison; and on Sundays

in the prison-church he read the lessons and sang in the

<BR>choir; for his voice was still good.



<P>The prison authorities liked Aksy&oacute;nof for his meekness, and his

fellow-prisoners respected him: they called him 'Grandfather,'

<BR>and 'The Saint.' When they wanted to petition the prison authorities

about anything, they always made Aksy&oacute;nof their

<BR>spokesman, and when there were quarrels among the prisoners they came

to him to put things right, and to judge the matter.



<P>No news reached Aksy&oacute;nof from his home, and he did not even know

if his wife and children were still alive.



<P>One day a fresh gang of convicts came to the prison. In the evening

the old prisoners collected round the new ones and asked

<BR>them what towns or villages they came from, and what they were sentenced

for. Among the rest Aksy&oacute;nof sat down near the

<BR>new-comers, and listened with downcast air to what was said.



<P>One of the new convicts, a tall, strong man of sixty, with a closely-cropped

grey beard, was telling the others what he had been

<BR>arrested for.



<P>'Well, friends,' he said, 'I only took a horse that was tied to a sledge,

and I was arrested and accused of stealing. I said I had

<BR>only taken it to get home quicker, and had then let it go; besides,

the driver was a personal friend of mine. So I said, "It's all

<BR>right." "No," said they, "you stole it." But how or where I stole it

they could not say. I once really did something wrong, and

<BR>ought by rights to have come here long ago, but that time I was not

found out. Now I have been sent here for nothing at all. . . .

<BR>Eh, but it's lies I'm telling you; I've been to Siberia before, but

I did not stay long.'



<P>'Where are you from?' asked some one.



<P>'From Vlad&iacute;mir. My family are of that town. My name is Mak&aacute;r,

and they also call me Semy&oacute;nitch.'



<P>Aksy&oacute;nof raised his head and said: 'Tell me, Semy&oacute;nitch,

do you know anything of the merchants Aksy&oacute;nof, of Vlad&iacute;mir?

Are

<BR>they still alive?'



<P>'Know them? Of course I do. The Aksy&oacute;nofs are rich, though their

father is in Siberia: a sinner like ourselves, it seems! As for

<BR>you, Gran'dad, how did you come here?'



<P>Aksy&oacute;nof did not like to speak of his misfortune. He only sighed,

and said, 'For my sins I have been in prison these twenty-six

<BR>years.'



<P>'What sins?' asked Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch.



<P>But Aksy&oacute;nof only said, 'Well, well -- I must have deserved it!'

He would have said no more, but his companions told the

<BR>new-comer how Aksy&oacute;nof came to be in Siberia: how some one had

killed a merchant and had put a knife among Aksy&oacute;nof's

<BR>things, and Aksy&oacute;nof had been unjustly condemned.



<P>When Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch heard this, he looked at Aksy&oacute;nof,

slapped his own knee, and exclaimed, 'Well this is wonderful!

<BR>Really wonderful! But how old you've grown, Gran'dad!'



<P>The others asked him why he was so surprised, and where he had seen

Aksy&oacute;nof before; but Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch did not reply.

<BR>He only said: 'It's wonderful that we should meet here, lads!'



<P>These words made Aksy&oacute;nof wonder whether this man knew who had

killed the merchant; so he said 'Perhaps, Semy&oacute;nitch,

<BR>you have heard of that affair or maybe you've seen me before?'



<P>'How could I help hearing? The world's full of rumours. But it's long

ago, and I've forgotten what I heard.'



<P>'Perhaps you heard who killed the merchant?' asked Aksy&oacute;nof.



<P>Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch laughed, and replied, 'It must have been

him in whose bag the knife was found! If some one else hid the

<BR>knife there, "He's not a thief till he's caught," as the saying is.

How could any one put a knife into your bag while it was under

<BR>your head? It would surely have woke you up?'



<P>When Aksy&oacute;nof heard these words, he felt sure this was the man

who had killed the merchant. He rose and went away. All

<BR>that night Aksy&oacute;nof lay awake.



<P>He felt terribly unhappy, and all sorts of images rose in his mind.

There was the image of his wife as she was when he parted

<BR>from her to go to the fair. He saw her as if she were present; her

face and her eyes rose before him; he heard her speak and

<BR>laugh. Then he saw his children, quite little, as they were at that

time: one with a little cloak on, another at his mother's breast.

<BR>And then he remembered himself as he used to be -- young and merry.

He remembered how he sat playing the guitar in the

<BR>porch of the inn where he was arrested, and how free from care he had

been. He saw, in his mind, the place where he was

<BR>flogged, the executioner, and the people standing around; the chains,

the convicts, all the twenty-six years of his prison life, and

<BR>his premature old age. The thought of it all made him so wretched that

he was ready to kill himself.



<P>'And it's all that villain's doing!' thought Aksy&oacute;nof. And his

anger was so great against Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch that he longed

for

<BR>vengeance, even if he himself should perish for it. He kept repeating

prayers all night, but could get no peace. During the day he

<BR>did not go near Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch, nor even look at him.



<P>A fortnight passed in this way. Aksy&oacute;nof could not sleep at nights,

and was so miserable that he did not know what to do.



<P>One night as he was walking about the prison he noticed some earth that

came rolling out from under one of the shelves on

<BR>which the prisoners slept. He stopped to see what it was. Suddenly

Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch crept out from under the shelf, and

<BR>looked up at Aksy&oacute;nof with frightened face. Aksy&oacute;nof

tried to pass without looking at him, but Mak&aacute;r seized his hand

and told

<BR>him that he had dug a hole under the wall, getting rid of the earth

by putting it into his high-boots, and emptying it out every day

<BR>on the road when the prisoners were driven to their work.



<P>'Just you keep quiet, old man, and you shall get out too. If you blab

they'll flog the life out of me, but I will kill you first.'



<P>Aksy&oacute;nof trembled with anger as he looked at his enemy. He drew

his hand away, saying, 'I have no wish to escape, and you

<BR>have no need to kill me; you killed me long ago! As to telling of you

-- I may do so or not, as God shall direct.'



<P>Next day, when the convicts were led out to work, the convoy soldiers

noticed that one or other of the prisoners emptied some

<BR>earth out of his boots. The prison was searched, and the tunnel found.

The Governor came and questioned all the prisoners to

<BR>find out who had dug the hole. They all denied any knowledge of it.

Those who knew, would not betray Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch,

<BR>knowing he would be flogged almost to death. At last the Governor turned

to Aksy&oacute;nof, whom he knew to be a just man, and

<BR>said:



<P>'You are a truthful old man; tell me, before God, who dug the hole?'



<P>Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch stood as if he were quite unconcerned,

looking at the Governor and not so much as glancing at Aksy&oacute;nof.

<BR>Aksy&oacute;nof's lips and hands trembled, and for a long time he could

not utter a word. He thought, 'Why should I screen him who

<BR>ruined my life? Let him pay for what I have suffered. But if I tell,

they will probably flog the life out of him and maybe I suspect

<BR>him wrongly. And, after all, what good would it be to me?'



<P>'Well, old man,' repeated the Governor, 'tell us the truth: who has

been digging under the wall?'



<P>Aksy&oacute;nof glanced at Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch, and said

'I cannot say, your honour. It is not God's will that I should tell! Do

what

<BR>you like with me; I am in your hands.'



<P>However much the Governor tried, Aksy&oacute;nof would say no more,

and so the matter had to be left.



<P>That night, when Aksy&oacute;nof was lying on his bed and just beginning

to doze, some one came quietly and sat down on his bed.

<BR>He peered through the darkness and recognized Mak&aacute;r.



<P>'What more do you want of me?' asked Aksy&oacute;nof. 'Why have you

come here?'



<P>Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch was silent. So Aksy&oacute;nof sat up

and said, 'What do you want? Go away, or I will call the guard!'



<P>Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch bent close over Aksy&oacute;nof, and

whispered, 'Iv&aacute;n Dm&iacute;tritch, forgive me!'



<P>'What for?' asked Aksy&oacute;nof.



<P>'It was I who killed the merchant and hid the knife among your things.

I meant to kill you too, but I heard a noise outside; so I

<BR>hid the knife in your bag and escaped out of the window.'



<P>Aksy&oacute;nof was silent, and did not know what to say. Mak&aacute;r

Semy&oacute;nitch slid off the bed-shelf and knelt upon the ground. 'Iv&aacute;n

<BR>Dm&iacute;tritch,' said he, 'forgive me! For the love of God, forgive

me! I will confess that it was I who killed the merchant, and you

<BR>will be released and can go to your home.'



<P>'It is easy for you to talk,' said Aksy&oacute;nof, 'but I have suffered

for you these twenty-six years. Where could I go to now? . . .

<BR>My wife is dead, and my children have forgotten me. I have nowhere

to go. . . .'



<P>Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch did not rise, but beat his head on the

floor. 'Iv&aacute;n Dm&iacute;tritch, forgive me!' he cried. 'When they

flogged me

<BR>with the knout it was not so hard to bear as it is to see you now .

. . yet you had pity on me, and did not tell. For Christ's sake

<BR>forgive me, wretch that I am!' And he began to sob.



<P>When Aksy&oacute;nof heard him sobbing he, too, began to weep.



<P>'God will forgive you!' said he. 'Maybe I am a hundred times worse than

you.' And at these words his heart grew light, and the

<BR>longing for home left him. He no longer had any desire to leave the

prison, but only hoped for his last hour to come.



<P>In spite of what Aksy&oacute;nof had said, Maker Semy&oacute;nitch confessed

his guilt. But when the order for his release came, Aksy&oacute;nof

<BR>was already dead.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THERE lived in olden times a good and kindly man. He had this world's

goods in abundance, and many slaves to serve him. And

<BR>the slaves prided themselves on their master, saying:



<P>'There is no better lord than ours under the sun. He feeds and clothes

us well, and gives us work suited to our strength. He bears

<BR>no malice and never speaks a harsh word to any one. He is not like

other masters, who treat their slaves worse than cattle:

<BR>punishing them whether they deserve it or not, and never giving them

a friendly word. He wishes us well, does good, and speaks

<BR>kindly to us. We do not wish for a better life.'



<P>Thus the slaves praised their lord, and the Devil, seeing it, was vexed

that slaves should live in such love and harmony with their

<BR>master. So getting one of them, whose name was Aleb, into his power,

the Devil ordered him to tempt the other slaves. And one

<BR>day, when they were all sitting together resting and talking of their

master's goodness, Aleb raised his voice, and said:



<P>'It is stupid to make so much of our master's goodness. The Devil himself

would be kind to you, if you did what he wanted. We

<BR>serve our master well, and humour him in all things. As soon as he

thinks of anything, we do it: foreseeing all his wishes. What can

<BR>he do but be kind to us? Just try how it will be if, instead of humouring

him, we do him some harm instead. He will act like any one

<BR>else, and will repay evil for evil, as the worst of masters do.



<P>The other slaves began denying what Aleb had said and at last bet with

him. Aleb undertook to make their master angry. If he

<BR>failed, he was to lose his holiday garment; but if he succeeded, the

other slaves were to give him theirs. Moreover, they promised

<BR>to defend him against the master, and to set him free if he should

be put in chains or imprisoned. Having arranged this bet, Aleb

<BR>agreed to make his master angry next morning.



<P>Aleb was a shepherd, and had in his charge a number of valuable, pure-bred

sheep, of which his master was very fond. Next

<BR>morning, when the master brought some visitors into the inclosure to

show them the valuable sheep, Aleb winked at his

<BR>companions, as if to say:



<P>'See, now, how angry I will make him.'



<P>All the other slaves assembled, looking in at the gates or over the

fence, and the Devil climbed a tree near by to see how his

<BR>servant would do his work. The master walked about the inclosure, showing

his guests the ewes and lambs, and presently he

<BR>wished to show them his finest ram.



<P>'All the rams are valuable,' said he, 'but I have one with closely twisted

horns, which is priceless. I prize him as the apple of my

<BR>eye.'



<P>Startled by the strangers, the sheep rushed about the inclosure, so

that the visitors could not get a good look at the ram. As soon as

<BR>it stood still, Aleb startled the sheep as if by accident, and they

all got mixed up again. The visitors could not make out which was

<BR>the priceless ram. At last the master got tired of it.



<P>'Aleb, dear friend,' he said, 'pray catch our best ram for me, the one

with the tightly twisted horns. Catch him very carefully, and

<BR>hold him still for a moment.'



<P>Scarcely had the master said this, when Aleb rushed in among the sheep

like a lion, and clutched the priceless ram. Holding him

<BR>fast by the wool, he seized the left hind leg with one hand, and, before

his master's eyes, lifted it and jerked it so that it snapped

<BR>like a dry branch. He had broken the ram's leg and it fell bleating

on to its knees. Then Aleb seized the right hind leg, while the left

<BR>twisted round and hung quite limp. The visitors and the slaves exclaimed

in dismay, and the Devil, sitting up in the tree, rejoiced

<BR>that Aleb had done his task so cleverly. The master looked as black

as thunder, frowned, bent his head, and did not say a word.

<BR>The visitors and the slaves were silent, too, waiting to see what would

follow. After remaining silent for a while, the master shook

<BR>himself as if to throw off some burden. Then he lifted his head, and

raising his eyes heavenward, remained so for a short time.

<BR>Presently the wrinkles passed from his face, and he looked down at

Aleb with a smile saying:



<P>'Oh, Aleb, Aleb! Your master bade you anger me; but my master is stronger

than yours. I am not angry with you, but I will make

<BR>your master angry. You are afraid that I shall punish you, and you

have been wishing for your freedom. Know, then, Aleb, that I

<BR>shall not punish you; but, as you wish to be free, here, before my

guests, I set you free. Go where you like, and take your holiday

<BR>garment with you!'



<P>And the kind master returned with his guests to the house; but the Devil,

grinding his teeth, fell down from the tree, and sank

<BR>through the ground.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>A PRISONER IN THE CAUCASUS</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>I



<P>AN officer named Zh&iacute;lin was serving in the army in the Caucasus.



<P>One day he received a letter from home. It was from his mother, who

wrote: 'I am getting old, and should like to see my dear

<BR>son once more before I die. Come and say good-bye to me and bury me,

and then, if God pleases, return to service again with

<BR>my blessing. But I have found a girl for you, who is sensible and good

and has some property. If you can love her, you might

<BR>marry her and remain at home.'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin thought it over. It was quite true, the old lady was failing

fast and he might not have another chance to see her alive. He

<BR>had better go, and, if the girl was nice, why not marry her?



<P>So he went to his Colonel, obtained leave of absence, said good-bye

to his comrades, stood the soldiers four pailfuls of

<BR>v&oacute;dka[4] as a farewell treat, and got ready to go.



<P>It was a time of war in the Caucasus. The roads were not safe by night

or day. If ever a Russian ventured to ride or walk any

<BR>distance away from his fort, the Tartars killed him or carried him

off to the hills. So it had been arranged that twice every week

<BR>a body of soldiers should march from one fortress to the next to convoy

travellers from point to point.



<P>It was summer. At daybreak the baggage-train got ready under shelter

of the fortress; the soldiers marched out; and all started

<BR>along the road. Zh&iacute;lin was on horseback, and a cart with his

things went with the baggage-train. They had sixteen miles to go.

<BR>The baggage-train moved slowly; sometimes the soldiers stopped, or

perhaps a wheel would come off one of the carts, or a

<BR>horse refuse to go on, and then everybody had to wait.



<P>When by the sun it was already past noon, they had not gone half the

way. It was dusty and hot, the sun was scorching and

<BR>there was no shelter anywhere: a bare plain all round -- not a tree,

not a bush, by the road.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin rode on in front, and stopped, waiting for the baggage

to overtake him. Then he heard the signal-horn sounded behind

<BR>him: the company had again stopped. So he began to think: 'Hadn't I

better ride on by myself? My horse is a good one: if the

<BR>Tartars do attack me, I can gallop away. Perhaps, however, it would

be wiser to wait.'



<P>As he sat considering, Kost&iacute;lin, an officer carrying a gun, rode

up to him and said:



<P>'Come along, Zh&iacute;lin, let's go on by ourselves. It's dreadful;

I am famished, and the heat is terrible. My shirt is wringing wet.'



<P>Kost&iacute;lin was a stout, heavy man, and the perspiration was running

down his red face. Zh&iacute;lin thought awhile, and then asked: 'Is

<BR>your gun loaded?'



<P>'Yes it is.'



<P>'Well, then, let's go, but on condition that we keep together.'



<P>So they rode forward along the road across the plain, talking, but keeping

a look-out on both sides. They could see afar all

<BR>round. But after crossing the plain the road ran through a valley between

two hills, and Zh&iacute;lin said: 'We had better climb that hill

<BR>and have a look round, or the Tartars may be on us before we know it.'



<P>But Kost&iacute;lin answered: 'What's the use? Let us go on.'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin, however, would not agree.



<P>'No,' he said; 'you can wait here if you like, but I'll go and look

round.' And he turned his horse to the left, up the hill. Zh&iacute;lin's

<BR>horse was a hunter, and carried him up the hillside as if it had wings.

(He had bought it for a hundred roubles as a colt out of a

<BR>herd, and had broken it in himself.) Hardly had he reached the top

of the hill, when he saw some thirty Tartars not much more

<BR>than a hundred yards ahead of him. As soon as he caught sight of them

he turned round but the Tartars had also seen him, and

<BR>rushed after him at full gallop, getting their guns out as they went.

Down galloped Zh&iacute;lin as fast as the horse's legs could go,

<BR>shouting to Kost&iacute;lin: 'Get your gun ready!'



<P>And, in thought, he said to his horse: 'Get me well out of this, my

pet; don't stumble, for if you do it's all up. Once I reach the

<BR>gun, they shan't take me prisoner.'



<P>But, instead of waiting, Kost&iacute;lin, as soon as he caught sight

of the Tartars, turned back towards the fortress at full speed,

<BR>whipping his horse now on one side now on the other, and its switching

tail was all that could be seen of him in the dust.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin saw it was a bad look-out; the gun was gone, and what

could he do with nothing but his sword? He turned his horse

<BR>towards the escort, thinking to escape, but there were six Tartars

rushing to cut him off. His horse was a good one, but theirs

<BR>were still better; and besides, they were across his path. He tried

to rein in his horse and to turn another way, but it was going

<BR>so fast it could not stop, and dashed on straight towards the Tartars.

He saw a red-bearded Tartar on a grey horse, with his

<BR>gun raised, come at him, yelling and showing his teeth.



<P>'Ah,' thought Zh&iacute;lin, 'I know you, devils that you are. If you

take me alive, you'll put me in a pit and flog me. I will not be taken

<BR>alive!'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin, though not a big fellow, was brave. He drew his sword

and dashed at the red-bearded Tartar thinking: 'Either I'll ride

<BR>him down, or disable him with my sword.'



<P>He was still a horse's length away from him, when he was fired at from

behind, and his horse was hit. It fell to the ground with

<BR>all its weight, pinning Zh&iacute;lin to the earth.



<P>He tried to rise, but two ill-savoured Tartars were already sitting

on him and binding his hands behind his back. He made an

<BR>effort and flung them off, but three others jumped from their horses

and began beating his head with the butts of their guns. His

<BR>eyes grew dim, and he fell back. The Tartars seized him, and, taking

spare girths from their saddles, twisted his hands behind

<BR>him and tied them with a Tartar knot. They knocked his cap off, pulled

off his boots, searched him all over, tore his clothes, and

<BR>took his money and his watch.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin looked round at his horse. There it lay on its side, poor

thing, just as it had fallen; struggling, its legs in the air, unable to

<BR>touch the ground. There was a hole in its head, and black blood was

pouring out, turning the dust to mud for a couple of feet

<BR>around.



<P>One of the Tartars went up to the horse and began taking the saddle

off, it still kicked, so he drew a dagger and cut its

<BR>windpipe. A whistling sound came from its throat, the horse gave one

plunge, and all was over.



<P>The Tartars took the saddle and trappings. The red-bearded Tartar mounted

his horse, and the others lifted Zh&iacute;lin into the

<BR>saddle behind him. To prevent his falling off, they strapped him to

the Tartar's girdle; and then they all rode away to the hills.



<P>So there sat Zh&iacute;lin, swaying from side to side, his head striking

against the Tartar's stinking back. He could see nothing but that

<BR>muscular back and sinewy neck, with its closely shaven, bluish nape.

Zh&iacute;lin's head was wounded: the blood had dried over his

<BR>eyes, and he could neither shift his position on the saddle nor wipe

the blood off. His arms were bound so tightly that his

<BR>collar-bones ached.



<P>They rode up and down hills for a long way. Then they reached a river

which they forded, and came to a hard road leading

<BR>across a valley.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin tried to see where they were going, but his eyelids were

stuck together with blood, and he could not turn.



<P>Twilight began to fall; they crossed another river and rode up a stony

hillside. There was a smell of smoke here, and dogs were

<BR>barking. They had reached an Aoul (a Tartar village). The Tartars got

off their horses; Tartar children came and stood round

<BR>Zh&iacute;lin, shrieking with pleasure and throwing stones at him.



<P>The Tartar drove the children away, took Zh&iacute;lin off the horse,

and called his man. A Nog&aacute;y[5] with high cheek-bones, and

<BR>nothing on but a shirt (and that so torn that his breast was all bare),

answered the call. The Tartar gave him an order. He went

<BR>and fetched shackles: two blocks of oak with iron rings attached, and

a clasp and lock fixed to one of the rings.



<P>They untied Zh&iacute;lin's arms, fastened the shackles on his leg,

and dragged him to a barn, where they pushed him in and locked the

<BR>door.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin fell on a heap of manure. He lay still awhile then groped

about to find a soft place, and settled down.



<P>II



<P>That night Zh&iacute;lin hardly slept at all. It was the time of year

when the nights are short, and daylight soon showed itself through a

<BR>chink in the wall. He rose, scratched to make the chink bigger, and

peeped out.



<P>Through the hole he saw a road leading down-hill; to the right was a

Tartar hut with two trees near it, a black dog lay on the

<BR>threshold, and a goat and kids were moving about wagging their tails.

Then he saw a young Tartar woman in a long, loose,

<BR>bright-coloured gown, with trousers and high boots showing from under

it. She had a coat thrown over her head, on which she

<BR>carried a large metal jug filled with water. She was leading by the

hand a small, closely-shaven Tartar boy, who wore nothing

<BR>but a shirt; and as she went along balancing herself, the muscles of

her back quivered. This woman carried the water into the

<BR>hut, and, soon after, the red-bearded Tartar of yesterday came out

dressed in a silk tunic, with a silver-hilted dagger hanging by

<BR>his side, shoes on his bare feet, and a tall black sheepskin cap set

far back on his head. He came out, stretched himself, and

<BR>stroked his red beard. He stood awhile, gave an order to his servant,

and went away.



<P>Then two lads rode past from watering their horses. The horses' noses

were wet. Some other closely-shaven boys ran out,

<BR>without any trousers, and wearing nothing but their shirts. They crowded

together, came to the barn, picked up a twig, and

<BR>began pushing it in at the chink. Zh&iacute;lin gave a shout, and the

boys shrieked and scampered off, their little bare knees gleaming as

<BR>they ran.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin was very thirsty: his throat was parched, and he thought:

'If only they would come and so much as look at me!'



<P>Then he heard some one unlocking the barn. The red-bearded Tartar entered,

and with him was another a smaller man, dark,

<BR>with bright black eyes, red cheeks and a short beard. He had a merry

face, and was always laughing. This man was even more

<BR>richly dressed than the other. He wore a blue silk tunic trimmed with

gold, a large silver dagger in his belt, red morocco slippers

<BR>worked with silver, and over these a pair of thick shoes, and he had

a white sheepskin cap on his head.



<P>The red-bearded Tartar entered, muttered something as if he were annoyed,

and stood leaning against the doorpost, playing

<BR>with his dagger, and glaring askance at Zh&iacute;lin, like a wolf.

The dark one, quick and lively and moving as if on springs, came

<BR>straight up to Zh&iacute;lin, squatted down in front of him, slapped

him on the shoulder, and began to talk very fast in his own

<BR>language. His teeth showed, and he kept winking, clicking his tongue,

and repeating, 'Good Russ, good Russ.'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin could not understand a word, but said, 'Drink! give me

water to drink!'



<P>The dark man only laughed. 'Good Russ,' he said, and went on talking

in his own tongue.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin made signs with lips and hands that he wanted something

to drink.



<P>The dark man understood, and laughed. Then he looked out of the door,

and called to some one: 'Dina!'



<P>A little girl came running in: she was about thirteen, slight, thin,

and like the dark Tartar in face. Evidently she was his daughter.

<BR>She, too, had clear black eyes, and her face was good-looking. She

had on a long blue gown with wide sleeves, and no girdle.

<BR>The hem of her gown, the front, and the sleeves, were trimmed with

red. She wore trousers and slippers, and over the slippers

<BR>stouter shoes with high heels. Round her neck she had a necklace made

of Russian silver coins. She was bareheaded, and her

<BR>black hair was plaited with a ribbon and ornamented with gilt braid

and silver coins.



<P>Her father gave an order, and she ran away and returned with a metal

jug. She handed the water to Zh&iacute;lin and sat down,

<BR>crouching so that her knees were as high as her head, and there she

sat with wide open eyes watching Zh&iacute;lin drink, as though he

<BR>were a wild animal.



<P>When Zh&iacute;lin handed the empty jug back to her, she gave such a

sudden jump back, like a wild goat, that it made her father

<BR>laugh. He sent her away for something else. She took the jug, ran out,

and brought back some unleavened bread on a round

<BR>board, and once more sat down, crouching, and looking on with staring

eves.



<P>Then the Tartars went away and again locked the door.



<P>After a while the Nog&aacute;y came and said: 'Ayda, the master, Ayda!'



<P>He, too, knew no Russian. All Zh&iacute;lin could make out was that

he was told to go somewhere.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin followed the N&oacute;gay, but limped, for the shackles

dragged his feet so that he could hardly step at all. On getting out of

the

<BR>barn he saw a Tartar village of about ten houses, and a Tartar church

with a small tower. Three horses stood saddled before

<BR>one of the houses; little boys were holding them by the reins. The

dark Tartar came out of this house, beckoning with his hand

<BR>for Zh&iacute;lin to follow him. Then he laughed, said something in

his own language, and returned into the house.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin entered. The room was a good one: the walls smoothly plastered

with clay. Near the front wall lay a pile of

<BR>bright-coloured feather beds; the side walls were covered with rich

carpets used as hangings, and on these were fastened guns,

<BR>pistols and swords, all inlaid with silver. Close to one of the walls

was a small stove on a level with the earthen floor. The floor

<BR>itself was as clean as a thrashing-ground. A large space in one corner

was spread over with felt, on which were rugs, and on

<BR>these rugs were cushions stuffed with down. And on these cushions sat

five Tartars, the dark one, the red-haired one, and three

<BR>guests. They were wearing their indoor slippers, and each had a cushion

behind his back. Before them were standing millet

<BR>cakes on a round board, melted butter in a bowl and a jug of buza,

or Tartar beer. They ate both cakes and butter with their

<BR>hands.



<P>The dark man jumped up and ordered Zh&iacute;lin to be placed on one

side, not on the carpet but on the bare ground, then he sat

<BR>down on the carpet again, and offered millet cakes and buza to his

guests. The servant made Zh&iacute;lin sit down, after which he

<BR>took off his own overshoes, put them by the door where the other shoes

were standing, and sat down nearer to his masters on

<BR>the felt, watching them as they ate, and licking his lips.



<P>The Tartars ate as much as they wanted, and a woman dressed in the same

way as the girl -- in a long gown and trousers, with

<BR>a kerchief on her head -- came and took away what was left, and brought

a handsome basin, and an ewer with a narrow spout.

<BR>The Tartars washed their hands, folded them, went down on their knees,

blew to the four quarters, and said their prayers. After

<BR>they had talked for a while, one of the guests turned to Zh&iacute;lin

and began to speak in Russian.



<P>'You were captured by Kazi-Mohammed,' he said, and pointed at the red-bearded

Tartar. 'And Kazi-Mohammed has given

<BR>you to Abdul Murat,' pointing at the dark one. 'Abdul Murat is now

your master.'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin was silent. Then Abdul Murat began to talk, laughing,

pointing to Zh&iacute;lin, and repeating, 'Soldier Russ, good Russ.'



<P>The interpreter said, 'He orders you to write home and tell them to

send a ransom, and as soon as the money comes he will set

<BR>you free.'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin thought for a moment, and said, 'How much ransom does

he want?'



<P>The Tartars talked awhile, and then the interpreter said, 'Three thousand

roubles.'



<P>'No,' said Zh&iacute;lin,' I can't pay so much.'



<P>Abdul jumped up and, waving his arms, talked to Zh&iacute;lin' thinking,

as before, that he would understand. The interpreter

<BR>translated: 'How much will you give?'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin considered, and said, 'Five hundred roubles.' At this

the Tartars began speaking very quickly, all together. Abdul began

<BR>to shout at the red-bearded one, and jabbered so fast that the spittle

spurted out of his mouth. The red-bearded one only

<BR>screwed up his eyes and clicked his tongue.



<P>They quietened down after a while, and the interpreter said, 'Five hundred

roubles is not enough for the master. He paid two

<BR>hundred for you himself. Kazi-Mohammed was in debt to him, and he took

you in payment. Three thousand roubles! Less than

<BR>that won't do. If you refuse to write, you will be put into a pit and

flogged with a whip!'



<P>'Eh!' thought Zh&iacute;lin, 'the more one fears them the worse it will

be.'



<P>So he sprang to his feet, and said, 'You tell that dog that if he tries

to frighten me I will not write at all, and he will get nothing. I

<BR>never was afraid of you dogs, and never will be!'



<P>The interpreter translated, and again they all began to talk at once.



<P>They jabbered for a long time, and then the dark man jumped up, came

to Zh&iacute;lin, and said: 'Dzhigit Russ, dzhigit Russ!'

<BR>(Dzhigit in their language means 'brave.') And he laughed, and said

something to the interpreter, who translated: 'One thousand

<BR>roubles will satisfy him.'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin stuck to it: 'I will not give more than five hundred.

And if you kill me you'll get nothing at all.'



<P>The Tartars talked awhile, then sent the servant out to fetch something,

and kept looking, now at Zh&iacute;lin, now at the door. The

<BR>servant returned, followed by a stout, bare-footed, tattered man, who

also had his leg shackled.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin gasped with surprise: it was Kost&iacute;lin. He, too,

had been taken. They were put side by side, and began to tell each other

<BR>what had occurred. While they talked, the Tartars looked on in silence.

Zh&iacute;lin related what had happened to him; and Kost&iacute;lin

<BR>told how his horse had stopped, his gun missed fire, and this same

Abdul had overtaken and captured him.



<P>Abdul jumped up, pointed to Kost&iacute;lin, and said something. The

interpreter translated that they both now belonged to one

<BR>master, and the one who first paid the ransom would be set free first.



<P>'There now,' he said to Zh&iacute;lin, 'you get angry, but your comrade

here is gentle; he has written home, and they will send five

<BR>thousand roubles. So he will be well fed and well treated.'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin replied: 'My comrade can do as he likes; maybe he is rich,

I am not. It must be as I said. Kill me, if you like -- you will

<BR>gain nothing by it; but I will not write for more than five hundred

roubles.'



<P>They were silent. Suddenly up sprang Abdul, brought a little box, took

out a pen, ink, and a bit of paper, gave them to Zh&iacute;lin,

<BR>slapped him on the shoulder, and made a sign that he should write.

He had agreed to take five hundred roubles.



<P>'Wait a bit!' said Zh&iacute;lin to the interpreter; 'tell him that

he must feed us properly, give us proper clothes and boots, and let us

be

<BR>together. It will be more cheerful for us. And he must have these shackles

taken off our feet,' and Zh&iacute;lin looked at his master

<BR>and laughed.



<P>The master also laughed, heard the interpreter, and said: 'I will give

them the best of clothes: a cloak and boots fit to be married

<BR>in. I will feed them like princes; and if they like they can live together

in the barn. But I can't take off the shackles, or they will

<BR>run away. They shall be taken off, however, at night.' And he jumped

up and slapped Zh&iacute;lin on the shoulder, exclaiming: 'You

<BR>good, I good!'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin wrote the letter, but addressed it wrongly, so that it

should not reach its destination, thinking to himself: 'I'll run away!'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin and Kost&iacute;lin were taken back to the barn and given

some maize straw, a jug of water, some bread, two old cloaks, and

<BR>some worn-out military boots -- evidently taken from the corpses of

Russian soldiers, At night their shackles were taken off

<BR>their feet, and they were locked up in the barn.



<P>III



<P>Zh&iacute;lin and his friend lived in this way for a whole month. The

master always laughed and said: 'You, Iv&aacute;n, good! I, Abdul,

<BR>good!' But he fed them badly giving them nothing but unleavened bread

of millet-flour baked into flat cakes, or sometimes only

<BR>unbaked dough.



<P>Kost&iacute;lin wrote home a second time, and did nothing but mope and

wait for the money to arrive. He would sit for days together

<BR>in the barn sleeping, or counting the days till a letter could come.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin knew his letter would reach no one, and he did not write

another. He thought: 'Where could my mother get enough

<BR>money to ransom me? As it is she lived chiefly on what I sent her.

If she had to raise five hundred roubles, she would be quite

<BR>ruined. With God's help I'll manage to escape!'



<P>So he kept on the look-out, planning how to run away.



<P>He would walk about the Aoul whistling; or would sit working, modelling

dolls of clay, or weaving baskets out of twigs: for

<BR>Zh&iacute;lin was clever with his hands.



<P>Once he modelled a doll with a nose and hands and feet and with a Tartar

gown on, and put it up on the roof. When the Tartar

<BR>women came out to fetch water, the master's daughter, Dina, saw the

doll and called the women, who put down their jugs and

<BR>stood looking and laughing. Zh&iacute;lin took down the doll and held

it out to them. They laughed, but dared not take it. He put down

<BR>the doll and went into the barn, waiting to see what would happen.



<P>Dina ran up to the doll, looked round, seized it, and ran away.



<P>In the morning, at daybreak, he looked out. Dina came out of the house

and sat down on the threshold with the doll, which she

<BR>had dressed up in bits of red stuff, and she rocked it like a baby,

singing a Tartar lullaby. An old woman came out and scolded

<BR>her, and snatching the doll away she broke it to bits, and sent Dina

about her business.



<P>But Zh&iacute;lin made another doll, better than the first, and gave

it to Dina. Once Dina brought a little jug, put it on the ground, sat

<BR>down gazing at him, and laughed, pointing to the jug.



<P>'What pleases her so?' wondered Zh&iacute;lin. He took the jug thinking

it was water, but it turned out to be milk. He drank the milk

<BR>and said: 'That's good!'



<P>How pleased Dina was! 'Good, Iv&aacute;n, good!' said she, and she jumped

up and clapped her hands. Then, seizing the jug, she ran

<BR>away. After that, she stealthily brought him some milk every day.



<P>The Tartars make a kind of cheese out of goat's milk, which they dry

on the roofs of their houses; and sometimes, on the sly,

<BR>she brought him some of this cheese. And once, when Abdul had killed

a sheep she brought Zh&iacute;lin a bit of mutton in her sleeve.

<BR>She would just throw the things down and run away.



<P>One day there was a heavy storm, and the rain fell in torrents for a

whole hour. All the streams became turbid. At the ford, the

<BR>water rose till it was seven feet high, and the current was so strong

that it rolled the stones about. Rivulets flowed everywhere,

<BR>and the rumbling in the hills never ceased. When the storm was over,

the water ran in streams down the village street. Zh&iacute;lin got

<BR>his master to lend him a knife, and with it he shaped a small cylinder,

and cutting some little boards, he made a wheel to which

<BR>he fixed two dolls, one on each side. The little girls brought him

some bits of stuff, and he dressed the dolls, one as a peasant,

<BR>the other as a peasant woman. Then he fastened them in their places,

and set the wheel so that the stream should work it. The

<BR>wheel began to turn and the dolls danced.



<P>The whole village collected round. Little boys and girls, Tartar men

and women, all came and clicked their tongues.



<P>'Ah, Russ! Ah, Iv&aacute;n!'



<P>Abdul had a Russian clock, which was broken. He called Zh&iacute;lin

and showed it to him, clicking his tongue.



<P>'Give it me, I'll mend it for you,' said Zh&iacute;lin.



<P>He took it to pieces with the knife, sorted the pieces, and put them

together again, so that the clock went all right.



<P>The master was delighted, and made him a present of one of his old tunics

which was all in holes. Zh&iacute;lin had to accept it. He

<BR>could, at any rate, use it as a coverlet at night.



<P>After that Zh&iacute;lin's fame spread; and Tartars came from distant

villages, bringing him now the lock of a gun or of a pistol, now a

<BR>watch, to mend. His master gave him some tools -- pincers, gimlets,

and a file.



<P>One day a Tartar fell ill, and they came to Zh&iacute;lin saying, 'Come

and heal him!' Zh&iacute;lin knew nothing about doctoring, but he went

<BR>to look, and thought to himself, 'Perhaps he will get well anyway.'



<P>He returned to the barn, mixed some water with sand, and then in the

presence of the Tartars whispered some words over it

<BR>and gave it to the sick man to drink. Luckily for him, the Tartar recovered.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin began to pick up their language a little, and some of

the Tartars grew familiar with him. When they wanted him, they

<BR>would call: 'Iv&aacute;n! Iv&aacute;n!' Others, however, still looked

at him askance, as at a wild beast.



<P>The red-bearded Tartar disliked Zh&iacute;lin. Whenever he saw him he

frowned and turned away, or swore at him. There was also

<BR>an old man there who did not live in the Aoul, but used to come up

from the foot of the hill. Zh&iacute;lin only saw him when he passed

<BR>on his way to the Mosque. He was short, and had a white cloth wound

round his hat. His beard and moustaches were clipped,

<BR>and white as snow; and his face was wrinkled and brick-red. His nose

was hooked like a hawk's, his grey eyes looked cruel,

<BR>and he had no teeth except two tusks. He would pass, with his turban

on his head, leaning on his staff, and glaring round him

<BR>like a wolf. If he saw Zh&iacute;lin he would snort with anger and

turn away.



<P>Once Zh&iacute;lin descended the hill to see where the old man lived.

He went down along the pathway and came to a little garden

<BR>surrounded by a stone wall; and behind the wall he saw cherry and apricot

trees, and a hut with a flat roof. He came closer,

<BR>and saw hives made of plaited straw, and bees flying about and humming.

The old man was kneeling, busy doing something

<BR>with a hive. Zh&iacute;lin stretched to look, and his shackles rattled.

The old man turned round, and, giving a yell, snatched a pistol

<BR>from his belt and shot at Zh&iacute;lin, who just managed to shelter

himself behind the stone wall.



<P>The old man went to Zh&iacute;lin's master to complain. The master called

Zh&iacute;lin, and said with a laugh, 'Why did you go to the old

<BR>man's house?'



<P>'I did him no harm,' replied Zh&iacute;lin. 'I only wanted to see how

he lived.'



<P>The master repeated what Zh&iacute;lin said.



<P>But the old man was in a rage; he hissed and jabbered, showing his tusks,

and shaking his fists at Zh&iacute;lin.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin could not understand all, but he gathered that the old

man was telling Abdul he ought not to keep Russians in the Aoul,

<BR>but ought to kill them. At last the old man went away.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin asked the master who the old man was.



<P>'He is a great man!' said the master. 'He was the bravest of our fellows;

he killed many Russians and was at one time very rich.

<BR>He had three wives and eight sons, and they all lived in one village.

Then the Russians came and destroyed the village, and

<BR>killed seven of his sons. Only one son was left, and he gave himself

up to the Russians. The old man also went and gave himself

<BR>up, and lived among the Russians for three months. At the end of that

time he found his son, killed him with his own hands, and

<BR>then escaped. After that he left off fighting, and went to Mecca to

pray to God; that is why he wears a turban. One who has

<BR>been to Mecca is called "Hadji," and wears a turban. He does not like

you fellows. He tells me to kill you. But I can't kill you. I

<BR>have paid money for you and, besides, I have grown fond of you, Iv&aacute;n.

Far from killing you, I would not even let you go if I

<BR>had not promised.' And he laughed, saying in Russian, 'You, Iv&aacute;n,

good; I, Abdul, good!'



<P>IV



<P>Zh&iacute;lin lived in this way for a month. During the day he sauntered

about the Aoul or busied himself with some handicraft, but at

<BR>night, when all was silent in the Aoul, he dug at the floor of the

barn. It was no easy task digging, because of the stones; but he

<BR>worked away at them with his file, and at last had made a hole under

the wall large enough to get through.



<P>'If only I could get to know the lay of the land,' thought he, 'and

which way to go! But none of the Tartars will tell me.'



<P>So he chose a day when the master was away from home, and set off after

dinner to climb the hill beyond the village, and to

<BR>look around. But before leaving home the master always gave orders

to his son to watch Zh&iacute;lin, and not to lose sight of him. So

<BR>the lad ran after Zh&iacute;lin, shouting: 'Don't go! Father does not

allow it. I'll call the neighbours if you won't come back.'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin tried to persuade him, and said: 'I'm not going far; I

only want to climb that hill. I want to find a herb -- to cure sick

<BR>people with. You come with me if you like. How can I run away with

these shackles on? To-morrow I'll make a bow and

<BR>arrows for you.'



<P>So he persuaded the lad, and they went. To look at the hill, it did

not seem far to the top; but it was hard walking with shackles

<BR>on his leg. Zh&iacute;lin went on and on, but it was all he could do

to reach the top. There he sat down and noted how the land lay. To

<BR>the south, beyond the barn, was a valley in which a herd of horses

was pasturing and at the bottom of the valley one could see

<BR>another Aoul. Beyond that was a still steeper hill, and another hill

beyond that. Between the hills, in the blue distance, were

<BR>forests, and still further off were mountains, rising higher and higher.

The highest of them were covered with snow, white as

<BR>sugar; and one snowy peak towered above all the rest. To the east and

to the west were other such hills, and here and there

<BR>smoke rose from Aouls in the ravines. 'Ah,' thought he, 'all that is

Tartar country.' And he turned towards the Russian side. At

<BR>his feet he saw a river, and the Aoul he lived in, surrounded by little

gardens. He could see women, like tiny dolls, sitting by the

<BR>river rinsing clothes. Beyond the Aoul was a hill, lower than the one

to the south, and beyond it two other hills well wooded;

<BR>and between these, a smooth bluish plain, and far, far across the plain

something that looked like a cloud of smoke. Zh&iacute;lin tried

<BR>to remember where the sun used to rise and set when he was living in

the fort, and he saw that there was no mistake: the

<BR>Russian fort must be in that plain. Between those two hills he would

have to make his way when he escaped.



<P>The sun was beginning to set. The white, snowy mountains turned red,

and the dark hills turned darker; mists rose from the

<BR>ravine, and the valley, where he supposed the Russian fort to be, seemed

on fire with the sunset glow. Zh&iacute;lin looked carefully.

<BR>Something seemed to be quivering in the valley like smoke from a chimney,

and he felt sure the Russian fortress was there.



<P>It had grown late. The Mullah's cry was heard. The herds were being

driven home, the cows were lowing, and the lad kept

<BR>saying, 'Come home!' But Zh&iacute;lin did not feel inclined to go

away.



<P>At last, however, they went back. 'Well,' thought Zh&iacute;lin, 'now

that I know the way, it is time to escape.' He thought of running

<BR>away that night. The nights were dark -- the moon had waned. But as

ill-luck would have it, the Tartars returned home that

<BR>evening. They generally came back driving cattle before them and in

good spirits. But this time they had no cattle. All they

<BR>brought home was the dead body of a Tartar -- the red one's brother

-- who had been killed. They came back looking sullen,

<BR>and they all gathered together for the burial. Zh&iacute;lin also came

out to see it.



<P>They wrapped the body in a piece of linen, without any coffin, and carried

it out of the village, and laid it on the grass under

<BR>some plane-trees. The Mullah and the old men came. They wound clothes

round their caps, took off their shoes, and squatted

<BR>on their heels, side by side, near the corpse.



<P>The Mullah was in front: behind him in a row were three old men in turbans,

and behind them again the other Tartars. All cast

<BR>down their eyes and sat in silence. This continued a long time, until

the Mullah raised his head and said: 'Allah!' (which means

<BR>God). He said that one word, and they all cast down their eyes again,

and were again silent for a long time. They sat quite still,

<BR>not moving or making any sound.



<P>Again the Mullah lifted his head and said, 'Allah!' and they all repeated:

'Allah! Allah!' and were again silent.



<P>The dead body lay immovable on the grass, and they sat as still as if

they too were dead. Not one of them moved. There was

<BR>no sound but that of the leaves of the plane-trees stirring in the

breeze. Then the Mullah repeated a prayer, and they all rose.

<BR>They lifted the body and carried it in their arms to a hole in the

ground. It was not an ordinary hole, but was hollowed out under

<BR>the ground like a vault. They took the body under the arms and by the

legs, bent it, and let it gently down, pushing it under the

<BR>earth in a sitting posture, with the hands folded in front.



<P>The Nog&aacute;y brought some green rushes, which they stuffed into

the hole, and, quickly covering it with earth, they smoothed the

<BR>ground, and set an upright stone at the head of the grave. Then they

trod the earth down, and again sat in a row before the

<BR>grave, keeping silence for a long time.



<P>At last they rose, said 'Allah! Allah! Allah!' and sighed.



<P>The red-bearded Tartar gave money to the old men; then he too rose,

took a whip, struck himself with it three times on the

<BR>forehead, and went home.



<P>The next morning Zh&iacute;lin saw the red Tartar, followed by three

others, leading a mare out of the village. When they were beyond

<BR>the village, the red-bearded Tartar took off his tunic and turned up

his sleeves, showing his stout arms. Then he drew a dagger

<BR>and sharpened it on a whetstone. The other Tartars raised the mare's

head, and he cut her throat, threw her down and began

<BR>skinning her, loosening the hide with his big hands. Women and girls

came and began to wash the entrails and the inwards. The

<BR>mare was cut up, the pieces taken into the hut, and the whole village

collected at the red Tartar's hut for a funeral feast.



<P>For three days they went on eating the flesh of the mare, drinking buza,

and praying for the dead man. All the Tartars were at

<BR>home. On the fourth day at dinner-time Zh&iacute;lin saw them preparing

to go away. Horses were brought out, they got ready, and

<BR>some ten of them (the red one among them) rode away; but Abdul stayed

at home. It was new moon, and the nights were still

<BR>dark.



<P>'Ah!' thought Zh&iacute;lin, 'to-night is the time to escape.' And he

told Kost&iacute;lin; but Kost&iacute;lin's heart failed him.



<P>'How can we escape?' he said. 'We don't even know the way.'



<P>'I know the way,' said Zh&iacute;lin.



<P>'Even if you do'' said Kost&iacute;lin, 'we can't reach the fort in

one night.'



<P>'If we can't,' said Zh&iacute;lin, 'we'll sleep in the forest. See here,

I have saved some cheeses. What's the good of sitting and moping

<BR>here? If they send your ransom -- well and good; but suppose they don't

manage to collect it? The Tartars are angry now,

<BR>because the Russians have killed one of their men. They are talking

of killing us.'



<P>Kost&iacute;lin thought it over.



<P>'Well, let's go,' said he.



<P>V



<P>Zh&iacute;lin crept into the hole, widened it so that Kost&iacute;lin

might also get through, and then they both sat waiting till all should

be quiet

<BR>in the Aoul.



<P>As soon as all was quiet, Zh&iacute;lin crept under the wall, got out,

and whispered to Kost&iacute;lin, 'Come!' Kost&iacute;lin crept out, but

in so

<BR>doing he caught a stone with his foot and made a noise. The master

had a very vicious watch-dog, a spotted one called

<BR>Oulyashin. Zh&iacute;lin had been careful to feed him for some time

before. Oulyashin heard the noise and began to bark and jump,

<BR>and the other dogs did the same. Zh&iacute;lin gave a slight whistle,

and threw him a bit of cheese. Oulyashin knew Zh&iacute;lin, wagged his

<BR>tail, and stopped barking.



<P>But the master had heard the dog, and shouted to him from his hut, 'Hayt,

hayt, Oulyashin!'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin, however, scratched Oulyashin behind the ears, and the

dog was quiet, and rubbed against his legs, wagging his tail



<P>They sat hidden behind a corner for awhile. All became silent again,

only a sheep coughed inside a shed, and the water rippled

<BR>over the stones in the hollow. It was dark, the stars were high overhead,

and the new moon showed red as it set, horns

<BR>upward, behind the hill. In the valleys the fog was white as milk.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin rose and said to his companion, 'Well, friend, come along!'



<P>They started; but they had only gone a few steps when they heard the

Mullah crying from the roof, 'Allah, Beshmillah!

<BR>Ilrahman!' That meant that the people would be going to the Mosque.

So they sat down again, hiding behind a wall, and waited

<BR>a long time till the people had passed. At last all was quiet again.



<P>'Now then! May God be with us!' They crossed themselves, and started

once more. They passed through a yard and went

<BR>down the hillside to the river, crossed the river, and went along the

valley.



<P>The mist was thick, but only near the ground; overhead the stars shone

quite brightly. Zh&iacute;lin directed their course by the stars. It

<BR>was cool in the mist, and easy walking, only their boots were uncomfortable,

being worn out and trodden down. Zh&iacute;lin took his

<BR>off, threw them away, and went barefoot, jumping from stone to stone,

and guiding his course by the stars. Kost&iacute;lin began to lag

<BR>behind.



<P>'Walk slower,' he said, 'these confounded boots have quite blistered

my feet.'



<P>'Take them off!' said Zh&iacute;lin. 'It will be easier walking without

them.'



<P>Kost&iacute;lin went barefoot, but got on still worse. The stones cut

his feet and he kept lagging behind. Zh&iacute;lin said: 'If your feet

get cut,

<BR>they'll heal again; but if the Tartars catch us and kill us, it will

be worse!'



<P>Kost&iacute;lin did not reply, but went on, groaning all the time.



<P>Their way lay through the valley for a long time. Then, to the right,

they heard dogs barking. Zh&iacute;lin stopped, looked about, and

<BR>began climbing the hill feeling with his hands.



<P>'Ah!' said he, 'we have gone wrong, and have come too far to the right.

Here is another Aoul, one I saw from the hill. We must

<BR>turn back and go up that hill to the left. There must be a wood there.'



<P>But Kost&iacute;lin said: 'Wait a minute! Let me get breath. My feet

are all cut and bleeding.'



<P>'Never mind, friend! They'll heal again. You should spring more lightly.

Like this!'



<P>And Zh&iacute;lin ran back and turned to the left up the hill towards

the wood.



<P>Kost&iacute;lin still lagged behind, and groaned. Zh&iacute;lin only

said 'Hush!' and went on and on.



<P>They went up the hill and found a wood as Zh&iacute;lin had said. They

entered the wood and forced their way through the brambles,

<BR>which tore their clothes. At last they came to a path and followed

it.



<P>'Stop!' They heard the tramp of hoofs on the path, and waited, listening.

It sounded like the tramping of a horse's feet, but then

<BR>ceased. They moved on, and again they heard the tramping. When they

paused, it also stopped. Zh&iacute;lin crept nearer to it, and

<BR>saw something standing on the path where it was not quite so dark.

It looked like a horse, and yet not quite like one, and on it

<BR>was something queer, not like a man. He heard it snorting. 'What can

it be?' Zh&iacute;lin gave a low whistle, and off it dashed from

<BR>the path into the thicket, and the woods were filled with the noise

of crackling, as if a hurricane were sweeping through,

<BR>breaking the branches.



<P>Kost&iacute;lin was so frightened that he sank to the ground. But Zh&iacute;lin

laughed and said: 'It's a stag. Don't you hear him breaking the

<BR>branches with his antlers? We were afraid of him, and he is afraid

of us.'



<P>They went on. The Great Bear was already setting. It was near morning,

and they did not know whether they were going the

<BR>right way or not. Zh&iacute;lin thought it was the way he had been

brought by the Tartars, and that they were still some seven miles

<BR>from the Russian fort; but he had nothing certain to go by, and at

night one easily mistakes the way. After a time they came to a

<BR>clearing. Kost&iacute;lin sat down and said: 'Do as you like, I can

go no farther! My feet won't carry me.'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin tried to persuade him.



<P>'No I shall never get there, I can't!'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin grew angry, and spoke roughly to him.



<P>'Well, then, I shall go on alone. Good-bye!'



<P>Kost&iacute;lin jumped up and followed. They went another three miles.

The mist in the wood had settled down still more densely;

<BR>they could not see a yard before them, and the stars had grown dim.



<P>Suddenly they heard the sound of a horse's hoofs in front of them. They

heard its shoes strike the stones. Zh&iacute;lin lay down flat,

<BR>and listened with his ear to the ground.



<P>'Yes, so it is! A horseman is coming towards us.'



<P>They ran off the path, crouched among the bushes and waited. Zh&iacute;lin

crept to the road, looked, and saw a Tartar on horseback

<BR>driving a cow and humming to himself. The Tartar rode past. Zh&iacute;lin

returned to Kost&iacute;lin.



<P>'God has led him past us; get up and let's go on!'



<P>Kost&iacute;lin tried to rise, but fell back again.



<P>'I can't; on my word I can't! I have no strength left.'



<P>He was heavy and stout, and had been perspiring freely. Chilled by the

mist, and with his feet all bleeding, he had grown quite

<BR>limp.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin tried to lift him, when suddenly Kost&iacute;lin screamed

out: 'Oh, how it hurts!'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin's heart sank.



<P>'What are you shouting for? The Tartar is still near; he'll have heard

you!' And he thought to himself, 'He is really quite done up.

<BR>What am I to do with him? It won't do to desert a comrade.'



<P>'Well, then, get up, and climb up on my back. I'll carry you if you

really can't walk.'



<P>He helped Kost&iacute;lin up, and put his arms under his thighs. Then

he went out on to the path, carrying him.



<P>'Only, for the love of heaven,' said Zh&iacute;lin, 'don't throttle

me with your hands! Hold on to my shoulders.'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin found his load heavy; his feet, too, were bleeding, and

he was tired out. Now and then he stooped to balance Kost&iacute;lin

<BR>better, jerking him up so that he should sit higher, and then went

on again.



<P>The Tartar must, however, really have heard Kost&iacute;lin scream.

Zh&iacute;lin suddenly heard some one galloping behind and shouting in

<BR>the Tartar tongue. He darted in among the bushes. The Tartar seized

his gun and fired, but did not hit them, shouted in his own

<BR>language, and galloped off along the road.



<P>'Well, now we are lost, friend!' said Zh&iacute;lin. 'That dog will

gather the Tartars together to hunt us down. Unless we can get a

<BR>couple of miles away from here we are lost!' And he thought to himself,

'Why the devil did I saddle myself with this block? I

<BR>should have got away long ago had I been alone.'



<P>'Go on alone,' said Kost&iacute;lin. 'Why should you perish because

of me?'



<P>'No I won't go. It won't do to desert a comrade.'



<P>Again he took Kost&iacute;lin on his shoulders and staggered on. They

went on in that way for another half-mile or more. They were

<BR>still in the forest, and could not see the end of it. But the mist

was already dispersing, and clouds seemed to be gathering, the

<BR>stars were no longer to be seen. Zh&iacute;lin was quite done up. They

came to a spring walled in with stones by the side of the path.

<BR>Zh&iacute;lin stopped and set Kost&iacute;lin down.



<P>'Let me have a rest and a drink,' said he, 'and let us eat some of the

cheese. It can't be much farther now.'



<P>But hardly had he lain down to get a drink, when he heard the sound

of horses' feet behind him. Again they darted to the right

<BR>among the bushes, and lay down under a steep slope.



<P>They heard Tartar voices. The Tartars stopped at the very spot where

they had turned off the path. The Tartars talked a bit,

<BR>and then seemed to be setting a dog on the scent. There was a sound

of crackling twigs, and a strange dog appeared from

<BR>behind the bushes. It stopped, and began to bark.



<P>Then the Tartars, also strangers, came climbing down, seized Zh&iacute;lin

and Kost&iacute;lin, bound them, put them on horses, and rode

<BR>away with them.



<P>When they had ridden about two miles, they met Abdul, their owner, with

two other Tartars following him. After talking with

<BR>the strangers, he put Zh&iacute;lin and Kost&iacute;lin on two of his

own horses and took them back to the Aoul.



<P>Abdul did not laugh now, and did not say a word to them.



<P>They were back at the Aoul by daybreak, and were set down in the street.

The children came crowding round, throwing

<BR>stones, shrieking, and beating them with whips.



<P>The Tartars gathered together in a circle, and the old man from the

foot of the hill was also there. They began discussing, and

<BR>Zh&iacute;lin heard them considering what should be done with him and

Kost&iacute;lin. Some said they ought to be sent farther into the

<BR>mountains; but the old man said: 'They must be killed!'



<P>Abdul disputed with him, saying: 'I gave money for them, and I must

get ransom for them.' But the old man said: 'They will pay

<BR>you nothing, but will only bring misfortune. It is a sin to feed Russians.

Kill them, and have done with it!'



<P>They dispersed. When they had gone, the master came up to Zh&iacute;lin

and said: 'If the money for your ransom is not sent within a

<BR>fortnight, I will flog you; and if you try to run away again, I'll

kill you like a dog! Write a letter, and write properly!'



<P>Paper was brought to them, and they wrote the letters. Shackles were

put on their feet, and they were taken behind the

<BR>Mosque to a deep pit about twelve feet square, into which they were

let down.



<P>VI



<P>Life was now very hard for them. Their shackles were never taken off,

and they were not let out into the fresh air. Unbaked

<BR>dough was thrown to them as if they were dogs, and water was let down

in a can.



<P>It was wet and close in the pit, and there was a horrible stench. Kost&iacute;lin

grew quite ill, his body became swollen and he ached

<BR>all over, and moaned or slept all the time. Zh&iacute;lin, too, grew

downcast; he saw it was a bad look-out, and could think of no way

<BR>of escape.



<P>He tried to make a tunnel, but there was nowhere to put the earth. His

master noticed it, and threatened to kill him.



<P>He was sitting on the floor of the pit one day, thinking of freedom

and feeling very downhearted, when suddenly a cake fell into

<BR>his lap, then another, and then a shower of cherries. He looked up,

and there was Dina. She looked at him, laughed, and ran

<BR>away. And Zh&iacute;lin thought: 'Might not Dina help me?'



<P>He cleared out a little place in the pit, scraped up some clay, and

began modelling toys. He made men, horses, and dogs,

<BR>thinking, 'When Dina comes I'll throw them up to her.'



<P>But Dina did not come next day. Zh&iacute;lin heard the tramp of horses;

some men rode past, and the Tartars gathered in council near

<BR>the Mosque. They shouted and argued; the word 'Russians' was repeated

several times. He could hear the voice of the old

<BR>man. Though he could not distinguish what was said, he guessed that

Russian troops were somewhere near, and that the

<BR>Tartars, afraid they might come into the Aoul, did not know what to

do with their prisoners.



<P>After talking awhile, they went away. Suddenly he heard a rustling overhead,

and saw Dina crouching at the edge of the pit, her

<BR>knees higher than her head, and bending over so that the coins of her

plait dangled above the pit. Her eyes gleamed like stars.

<BR>She drew two cheeses out of her sleeve and threw them to him. Zh&iacute;lin

took them and said, 'Why did you not come before? I

<BR>have made some toys for you. Here, catch!' And he began throwing the

toys up, one by one.



<P>But she shook her head and would not look at them.



<P>'I don't want any,' she said. She sat silent for awhile, and then went

on, 'Iv&aacute;n, they want to kill you!' And she pointed to her

<BR>own throat.



<P>'Who wants to kill me?'



<P>'Father; the old men say he must. But I am sorry for you!'



<P>Zh&iacute;lin answered: 'Well, if you are sorry for me, bring me a long

pole.'



<P>She shook her head, as much as to say, 'I can't!'



<P>He clasped his hands and prayed her: 'Dina, please do! Dear Dina, I

beg of you!'



<P>'I can't!' she said, 'they would see me bringing it. They're all at

home.' And she went away.



<P>So when evening came Zh&iacute;lin still sat looking up now and then,

and wondering what would happen. The stars were there, but

<BR>the moon had not yet risen. The Mullah's voice was heard; then all

was silent. Zh&iacute;lin was beginning to doze, thinking: 'The girl

<BR>will be afraid to do it!'



<P>Suddenly he felt clay falling on his head. He looked up, and saw a long

pole poking into the opposite wall of the pit. It kept

<BR>poking about for a time, and then it came down, sliding into the pit.

Zh&iacute;lin was glad indeed. He took hold of it and lowered it. It

<BR>was a strong pole, one that he had seen before on the roof of his master's

hut.



<P>He looked up. The stars were shining high in the sky, and just above

the pit Dina's eyes gleamed in the dark like a cat's. She

<BR>stooped with her face close to the edge of the pit, and whispered,

'Iv&aacute;n! Iv&aacute;n!' waving her hand in front of her face to show

that

<BR>he should speak low.



<P>'What?' said Zh&iacute;lin.



<P>'All but two have gone away.'



<P>Then Zh&iacute;lin said, 'Well, Kost&iacute;lin, come; let us have one

last try; I'll help you up.'



<P>But Kost&iacute;lin would not hear of it.



<P>'No,' said he, 'It's clear I can't get away from here. How can I go,

when I have hardly strength to turn round?'



<P>'Well, good-bye, then! Don't think ill of me!' and they kissed each

other. Zh&iacute;lin seized the pole, told Dina to hold on, and began

<BR>to climb. He slipped once or twice; the shackles hindered him. Kost&iacute;lin

helped him, and he managed to get to the top. Dina with

<BR>her little hands, pulled with all her might at his shirt, laughing.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin drew out the pole and said, 'Put it back in its place,

Dina, or they'll notice, and you will be beaten.'



<P>She dragged the pole away, and Zh&iacute;lin went down the hill. When

he had gone down the steep incline, he took a sharp stone

<BR>and tried to wrench the lock off the shackles. But it was a strong

lock and he could not manage to break it, and besides, it was

<BR>difficult to get at. Then he heard some one running down the hill,

springing lightly. He thought: 'Surely, that's Dina again.'



<P>Dina came, took a stone and said, 'Let me try.'



<P>She knelt down and tried to wrench the lock off, but her little hands

were as slender as little twigs, and she had not the strength.

<BR>She threw the stone away and began to cry. Then Zh&iacute;lin set to

work again at the lock, and Dina squatted beside him with her

<BR>hand on his shoulder.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin looked round and saw a red light to the left behind the

hill. The moon was just rising. 'Ah!' he thought, 'before the moon

<BR>has risen I must have passed the valley and be in the forest.' So he

rose and threw away the stone. Shackles or no, he must go

<BR>on.



<P>'Good-bye, Dina dear!' he said. 'I shall never forget you!'



<P>Dina seized hold of him and felt about with her hands for a place to

put some cheeses she had brought. He took them from her.



<P>'Thank you, my little one. Who will make dolls for you when I am gone?'

And he stroked her head.



<P>Dina burst into tears hiding her face in her hands. Then she ran up

the hill like a young goat, the coins in her plait clinking against

<BR>her back.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin crossed himself took the lock of his shackles in his hand

to prevent its clattering, and went along the road, dragging his

<BR>shackled leg, and looking towards the place where the moon was about

to rise. He now knew the way. If he went straight he

<BR>would have to walk nearly six miles. If only he could reach the wood

before the moon had quite risen! He crossed the river; the

<BR>light behind the hill was growing whiter. Still looking at it, he went

along the valley. The moon was not yet visible. The light

<BR>became brighter, and one side of the valley was growing lighter and

lighter, and shadows were drawing in towards the foot of

<BR>the hill, creeping nearer and nearer to him.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin went on, keeping in the shade. He was hurrying, but the

moon was moving still faster; the tops of the hills on the right

<BR>were already lit up. As he got near the wood the white moon appeared

from behind the hills, and it became light as day. One

<BR>could see all the leaves on the trees. It was light on the hill, but

silent, as if nothing were alive; no sound could be heard but the

<BR>gurgling of the river below.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin reached the wood without meeting any one, chose a dark

spot, and sat down to rest.



<P>He rested and ate one of the cheeses. Then he found a stone and set

to work again to knock off the shackles. He knocked his

<BR>hands sore, but could not break the lock. He rose and went along the

road. After walking the greater part of a mile he was

<BR>quite done up, and his feet were aching. He had to stop every ten steps.

'There is nothing else for it,' thought he. 'I must drag on

<BR>as long as I have any strength left. If I sit down, I shan't be able

to rise again. I can't reach the fortress; but when day breaks I'll

<BR>lie down in the forest, remain there all day, and go on again at night.'



<P>He went on all night. Two Tartars on horseback passed him; but he heard

them a long way off, and hid behind a tree.



<P>The moon began to grow paler, the dew to fall. It was getting near dawn,

and Zh&iacute;lin had not reached the end of the forest.

<BR>'Well,' thought he, 'I'll walk another thirty steps, and then turn

in among the trees and sit down.'



<P>He walked another thirty steps, and saw that he was at the end of the

forest. He went to the edge; it was now quite light, and

<BR>straight before him was the plain and the fortress. To the left, quite

close at the foot of the slope, a fire was dying out, and the

<BR>smoke from it spread round. There were men gathered about the fire.



<P>He looked intently, and saw guns glistening. They were soldiers -- Cossacks!



<P>Zh&iacute;lin was filled with joy. He collected his remaining strength

and set off down the hill, saying to himself: 'God forbid that any

<BR>mounted Tartar should see me now, in the open field! Near as I am,

I could not get there in time.'



<P>Hardly had he said this when, a couple of hundred yards off, on a hillock

to the left, he saw three Tartars.



<P>They saw him also and made a rush. His heart sank. He waved his hands,

and shouted with all his might, 'Brothers, brothers!

<BR>Help!'



<P>The Cossacks heard him, and a party of them on horseback darted to cut

across the Tartars' path. The Cossacks were far and

<BR>the Tartars were near; but Zh&iacute;lin, too, made a last effort.

Lifting the shackles with his hand, he ran towards the Cossacks, hardly

<BR>knowing what he was doing, crossing himself and shouting, 'Brothers!

Brothers! Brothers!'



<P>There were some fifteen Cossacks. The Tartars were frightened, and stopped

before reaching him. Zhilin staggered up to the

<BR>Cossacks.



<P>They surrounded him and began questioning him. 'Who are you? What are

you? Where from?



<P>But Zh&iacute;lin was quite beside himself, and could only weep and

repeat, 'Brothers! Brothers!'



<P>Then the soldiers came running up and crowded round Zh&iacute;lin --

one giving him bread, another buckwheat, a third v&oacute;dka: one

<BR>wrapping a cloak round him, another breaking his shackles.



<P>The officers recognized him, and rode with him to the fortress. The

soldiers were glad to see him back, and his comrades all

<BR>gathered round him.



<P>Zh&iacute;lin told them all that had happened to him.



<P>'That's the way I went home and got married!' said he. 'No. It seems

plain that fate was against it!'



<P>So he went on serving in the Caucasus. A month passed before Kost&iacute;lin

was released, after paying five thousand roubles

<BR>ransom. He was almost dead when they brought him back.

<P><B>(TOLSTOY'S ADAPTATION OF A STORY BY GUY DE MAUPASSANT. )</B>



<P>NEAR the borders of France and Italy, on the shore of the Mediterranean

Sea, lies a tiny little kingdom called Monaco. Many a

<BR>small country town can boast more inhabitants than this kingdom, for

there are only about seven thousand of them all told, and if all

<BR>the land in the kingdom were divided there would not be an acre for

each inhabitant. But in this toy kingdom there is a real kinglet;

<BR>and he has a palace, and courtiers, and ministers, and a bishop, and

generals, and an army.



<P>It is not a large army, only sixty men in all, but still it is an army.

There were also taxes in this kingdom as elsewhere: a tax on

<BR>tobacco, and on wine and spirits and a poll-tax. But though the people

there drink and smoke as people do in other countries, there

<BR>are so few of them that the King would have been hard put to it to

feed his courtiers and officials and to keep himself, if he had

<BR>not found a new and special source of revenue. This special revenue

comes from a gaming house, where people play roulette.

<BR>People play, and whether they win or lose the keeper always gets a

percentage on the turnover; and out of his profits he pays a

<BR>large sum to the King. The reason he pays so much is that it is the

only such gambling establishment left in Europe. Some of the

<BR>little German Sovereigns used to keep gaming houses of the same kind,

but some years ago they were forbidden to do so. The

<BR>reason they were stopped was because these gaming houses did so much

harm. A man would come and try his luck, then he

<BR>would risk all he had and lose it, then he would even risk money that

did not belong to him and lose that too, and then, in despair, he

<BR>would drown or shoot himself. So the Germans forbade their rulers to

make money in this way; but there was no one to stop the

<BR>King of Monaco, and he remained with a monopoly of the business.



<P>So now every one who wants to gamble goes to Monaco. Whether they win

or lose, the King gains by it. 'You can't earn stone

<BR>palaces by honest labour,' as the proverb says; and the Kinglet of

Monaco knows it is a dirty business, but what is he to do? He

<BR>has to live; and to draw a revenue from drink and from tobacco is also

not a nice thing. So he lives and reigns, and rakes in the

<BR>money, and holds his court with all the ceremony of a real king.



<P>He has his coronation, his levees; he rewards, sentences, and pardons,

and he also has his reviews, councils, laws, and courts of

<BR>justice: just like other kings, only all on a smaller scale.



<P>Now it happened a few years ago that a murder was committed in this

toy King's domains. The people of that kingdom are

<BR>peaceable, and such a thing had not happened before. The judges assembled

with much ceremony and tried the case in the most

<BR>judicial manner. There were judges, and prosecutors, and jurymen, and

barristers. They argued and judged, and at last they

<BR>condemned the criminal to have his head cut off as the law directs.

So far so good. Next they submitted the sentence to the King.

<BR>The King read the sentence and confirmed it. 'If the fellow must be

executed, execute him.'



<P>There was only one hitch in the matter; and that was that they had neither

a guillotine for cutting heads off, nor an executioner.

<BR>The Ministers considered the matter, and decided to address an inquiry

to the French Government, asking whether the French

<BR>could not lend them a machine and an expert to cut off the criminal's

head; and if so, would the French kindly inform them what

<BR>the cost would be. The letter was sent. A week later the reply came:

a machine and an expert could be supplied, and the cost

<BR>would be 16,000 francs. This was laid before the King. He thought it

over. Sixteen thousand francs! 'The wretch is not worth the

<BR>money,' said he. 'Can't it be done, somehow, cheaper? Why 16,000 francs

is more than two francs a head on the whole population.

<BR>The people won't stand it, and it may cause a riot!'



<P>So a Council was called to consider what could be done; and it was decided

to send a similar inquiry to the King of Italy. The

<BR>French Government is republican, and has no proper respect for kings;

but the King of Italy was a brother monarch, and might be

<BR>induced to do the thing cheaper. So the letter was written, and a prompt

reply was received.



<P>The Italian Government wrote that they would have pleasure in supplying

both a machine and an expert; and the whole cost would

<BR>be 12,000 francs, including travelling expenses. This was cheaper,

but still it seemed too much. The rascal was really not worth the

<BR>money. It would still mean nearly two francs more per head on the taxes.

Another Council was called. They discussed and

<BR>considered how it could be done with less expense. Could not one of

the soldiers perhaps be got to do it in a rough and homely

<BR>fashion? The General was called and was asked: 'Can't you find us a

soldier who would cut the man's head off? In war they don't

<BR>mind killing people. In fact, that is what they are trained for.' So

the General talked it over with the soldiers to see whether one of

<BR>them would not undertake the job. But none of the soldiers would do

it. 'No,' they said, 'we don't know how to do it; it is not a thing

<BR>we have been taught.'



<P>What was to be done? Again the Ministers considered and reconsidered.

They assembled a Commission, and a Committee, and a

<BR>Sub-Committee, and at last they decided that the best thing would be

to alter the death sentence to one of imprisonment for life.

<BR>This would enable the King to show his mercy, and it would come cheaper.



<P>The King agreed to this, and so the matter was arranged. The only hitch

now was that there was no suitable prison for a man

<BR>sentenced for life. There was a small lock-up where people were sometimes

kept temporarily, but there was no strong prison fit

<BR>for permanent use. However, they managed to find a place that would

do, and they put the young fellow there and placed a guard

<BR>over him. The guard had to watch the criminal, and had also to fetch

his food from the palace kitchen.



<P>The prisoner remained there month after month till a year had passed.

But when a year had passed, the Kinglet, looking over the

<BR>account of his income and expenditure one day, noticed a new item of

expenditure. This was for the keep of the criminal; nor was

<BR>it a small item either. There was a special guard, and there was also

the man's food. It came to more than 600 francs a year. And

<BR>the worst of it was that the fellow was still young and healthy, and

might live for fifty years. When one came to reckon it up, the

<BR>matter was serious. It would never do. So the King summoned his Ministers

and said to them:



<P>'You must find some cheaper way of dealing with this rascal. The present

plan is too expensive.' And the Ministers met and

<BR>considered and reconsidered, till one of them said: 'Gentlemen, in

my opinion we must dismiss the guard.' 'But then,' rejoined

<BR>another Minister, 'the fellow will run away.' 'Well,' said the first

speaker, 'let him run away, and be hanged to him!' So they

<BR>reported the result of their deliberations to the Kinglet, and he agreed

with them. The guard was dismissed, and they waited to see

<BR>what would happen. All that happened was that at dinner-time the criminal

came out, and, not finding his guard, he went to the

<BR>King's kitchen to fetch his own dinner. He took what was given him,

returned to the prison, shut the door on himself, and stayed

<BR>inside. Next day the same thing occurred. He went for his food at the

proper time; but as for running away, he did not show the

<BR>least sign of it! What was to be done? They considered the matter again.



<P>'We shall have to tell him straight out,' said they 'that we do not

want to keep him.' So the Minister of Justice had him brought

<BR>before him.



<P>'Why do you not run away?' said the Minister. 'There is no guard to

keep you. You can go where you like, and the King will not

<BR>mind.'



<P>'I daresay the King would not mind,' replied the man, 'but I have nowhere

to go. What can I do? You have ruined my character by

<BR>your sentence, and people will turn their backs on me. Besides, I have

got out of the way of working. You have treated me badly.

<BR>It is not fair. In the first place, when once you sentenced me to death

you ought to have executed me; but you did not do it. That is

<BR>one thing. I did not complain about that. Then you sentenced me to

imprisonment for life and put a guard to bring me my food; but

<BR>after a time you took him away again and I had to fetch my own food.

Again I did not complain. But now you actually want me to

<BR>go away! I can't agree to that. You may do as you like, but I won't

go away!'



<P>What was to be done? Once more the Council was summoned. What course

could they adopt? The man would not go. They

<BR>reflected and considered. The only way to get rid of him was to offer

him a pension. And so they reported to the King. 'There is

<BR>nothing else for it,' said they; 'we must get rid of him somehow.'

The sum fixed was 600 francs, and this was announced to the

<BR>prisoner.



<P>'Well,' said he, 'I don't mind, so long as you undertake to pay it regularly.

On that condition I am willing to go.'



<P>So the matter was settled. He received one-third of his annuity in advance,

and left the King's dominions. It was only a quarter of

<BR>an hour by rail; and he emigrated, and settled just across the frontier,

where he bought a bit of land, started market-gardening, and

<BR>now lives comfortably. He always goes at the proper time to draw his

pension. Having received it, he goes to the gaming tables,

<BR>stakes two or three francs, sometimes wins and sometimes loses, and

then returns home. He lives peaceably and well.



<P>It is a good thing that he did not commit his crime in a country where

they do not grudge expense to cut a man's head off, or to

<BR>keeping him in prison for life.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>THREE QUESTIONS</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>IT once occurred to a certain king, that if he always knew the right

time to begin everything; if he knew who were the right people

<BR>to listen to, and whom to avoid, and, above all, if he always knew

what was the most important thing to do, he would never fail in

<BR>anything he might undertake.



<P>And this thought having occurred to him, he had it proclaimed throughout

his kingdom that he would give a great reward to any

<BR>one who would teach him what was the right time for every action, and

who were the most necessary people, and how he might

<BR>know what was the most important thing to do.



<P>And learned men came to the King, but they all answered his questions

differently.



<P>In reply to the first question, some said that to know the right time

for every action, one must draw up in advance, a table of days,

<BR>months and years, and must live strictly according to it. Only thus,

said they, could everything be done at its proper time. Others

<BR>declared that it was impossible to decide beforehand the right time

for every action; but that, not letting oneself be absorbed in idle

<BR>pastimes, one should always attend to all that was going on, and then

do what was most needful. Others, again, said that however

<BR>attentive the King might be to what was going on, it was impossible

for one man to decide correctly the right time for every action,

<BR>but that he should have a Council of wise men, who would help him to

fix the proper time for everything.



<P>But then again others said there were some things which could not wait

to be laid before a Council, but about which one had at

<BR>once to decide whether to undertake them or not. But in order to decide

that one must know beforehand what was going to

<BR>happen. It is only magicians who know that; and, therefore in order

to know the right time for every action, one must consult

<BR>magicians.



<P>Equally various were the answers to the second question. Some said,

the people the King most needed were his councillors;

<BR>others, the priests; others, the doctors; while some said the warriors

were the most necessary.



<P>To the third question, as to what was the most important occupation:

some replied that the most important thing in the world was

<BR>science. Others said it was skill in warfare; and others, again, that

it was religious worship.



<P>All the answers being different, the King agreed with none of them,

and gave the reward to none. But still wishing to find the right

<BR>answers to his questions, he decided to consult a hermit, widely renowned

for his wisdom.



<P>The hermit lived in a wood which he never quitted and he received none

but common folk. So the King put on simple clothes, and

<BR>before reaching the hermit's cell dismounted from his horse, and, leaving

his bodyguard behind, went on alone.



<P>When the King approached, the hermit was digging the ground in front

of his hut. Seeing the King, he greeted him and went on

<BR>digging. The hermit was frail and weak, and each time he stuck his

spade into the ground and turned a little earth, he breathed

<BR>heavily.



<P>The King went up to him and said: 'I have come to you, wise hermit,

to ask you to answer three questions: How can I learn to do

<BR>the right thing at the right time? Who are the people I most need,

and to whom should I, therefore, pay more attention than to the

<BR>rest? And, what affairs are the most important and need my first attention?'



<P>The hermit listened to the King, but answered nothing. He just spat

on his hand and recommenced digging.



<P>'You are tired,' said the King, 'let me take the spade and work awhile

for you.'



<P>'Thanks!' said the hermit, and, giving the spade to the King, he sat

down on the ground.



<P>When he had dug two beds, the King stopped and repeated his questions.

The hermit again gave no answer, but rose, stretched

<BR>out his hand for the spade, and said:



<P>'Now rest awhile -- and let me work a bit.'



<P>But the King did not give him the spade, and continued to dig. One hour

passed, and another. The sun began to sink behind the

<BR>trees, and the King at last stuck the spade into the ground, and said:



<P>'I came to you, wise man, for an answer to my questions. If you can

give me none, tell me so, and I will return home.'



<P>'Here comes some one running,' said the hermit, 'let us see who it is.'



<P>The King turned round, and saw a bearded man come running out of the

wood. The man held his hands pressed against his

<BR>stomach, and blood was flowing from under them. When he reached the

King, he fell fainting on the ground moaning feebly. The

<BR>King and the hermit unfastened the man's clothing. There was a large

wound in his stomach. The King washed it as best he could,

<BR>and bandaged it with his handkerchief and with a towel the hermit had.

But the blood would not stop flowing, and the King again

<BR>and again removed the bandage soaked with warm blood, and washed and

rebandaged the wound. When at last the blood ceased

<BR>flowing, the man revived and asked for something to drink. The King

brought fresh water and gave it to him. Meanwhile the sun

<BR>had set, and it had become cool. So the King, with the hermit's help,

carried the wounded man into the hut and laid him on the bed.

<BR>Lying on the bed the man closed his eyes and was quiet; but the King

was so tired with his walk and with the work he had done,

<BR>that he crouched down on the threshold, and also fell asleep -- so

soundly that he slept all through the short summer night. When

<BR>he awoke in the morning, it was long before he could remember where

he was, or who was the strange bearded man lying on the

<BR>bed and gazing intently at him with shining eyes.



<P>'Forgive me!' said the bearded man in a weak voice, when he saw that

the King was awake and was looking at him.



<P>'I do not know you, and have nothing to forgive you for,' said the King.



<P>'You do not know me, but I know you. I am that enemy of yours who swore

to revenge himself on you, because you executed his

<BR>brother and seized his property. I knew you had gone alone to see the

hermit, and I resolved to kill you on your way back. But the

<BR>day passed and you did not return. So I came out from my ambush to

find you, and I came upon your bodyguard, and they

<BR>recognized me, and wounded me. I escaped from them, but should have

bled to death had you not dressed my wound. I wished to

<BR>kill you, and you have saved my life. Now, if I live, and if you wish

it, I will serve you as your most faithful slave, and will bid my

<BR>sons do the same. Forgive me!'



<P>The King was very glad to have made peace with his enemy so easily,

and to have gained him for a friend, and he not only

<BR>forgave him, but said he would send his servants and his own physician

to attend him, and promised to restore his property.



<P>Having taken leave of the wounded man, the King went out into the porch

and looked around for the hermit. Before going away

<BR>he wished once more to beg an answer to the questions he had put. The

hermit was outside, on his knees, sowing seeds in the

<BR>beds that had been dug the day before.



<P>The King approached him, and said:



<P>'For the last time, I pray you to answer my questions, wise man.'



<P>'You have already been answered!' said the hermit still crouching on

his thin legs, and looking up at the King, who stood before

<BR>him.



<P>'How answered? What do you mean?' asked the King.



<P>'Do you not see,' replied the hermit. 'If you had not pitied my weakness

yesterday, and had not dug these beds for me, but had

<BR>gone your way, that man would have attacked you, and you would have

repented of not having stayed with me. So the most

<BR>important time was when you were digging the beds; and I was the most

important man; and to do me good was your most

<BR>important business. Afterwards, when that man ran to us, the most important

time was when you were attending to him, for if you

<BR>had not bound up his wounds he would have died without having made

peace with you. So he was the most important man, and

<BR>what you did for him was your most important business. Remember then:

there is only one time that is important -- Now! It is the

<BR>most important time because it is the only time when we have any power.

The most necessary man is he with whom you are, for

<BR>no man knows whether he will ever have dealings with any one else:

and the most important affair is, to do him good, because for

<BR>that purpose alone was man sent into this life!'

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>THE COFFEE-HOUSE OF SURAT</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P><B>(AFTER BERNARDIN DE SENT-PIERRE.)</B>



<P>IN the town of Surat, in India, was a coffee-house where many travellers

and foreigners from all parts of the world met and

<BR>conversed.



<P>One day a learned Persian theologian visited this coffee-house. He was

a man who had spent his life studying the nature of the

<BR>Deity, and reading and writing books upon the subject. He had thought,

read, and written so much about God, that eventually he

<BR>lost his wits became quite confused, and ceased even to believe in

the existence of a God. The Shah, hearing of this, had banished

<BR>him from Persia.



<P>After having argued all his life about the First Cause, this unfortunate

theologian had ended by quite perplexing himself, and instead

<BR>of understanding that he had lost his own reason, he began to think

that there was no higher Reason controlling the universe.



<P>This man had an African slave who followed him everywhere. When the

theologian entered the coffeehouse, the slave remained

<BR>outside, near the door sitting on a stone in the glare of the sun,

and driving away the flies that buzzed around him. The Persian

<BR>having settled down on a divan in the coffee-house, ordered himself

a cup of opium. When he had drunk it and the opium had

<BR>begun to quicken the workings of his brain, he addressed his slave

through the open door:



<P>'Tell me, wretched slave,' said he, 'do you think there is a God, or

not?'



<P>'Of course there is,' said the slave, and immediately drew from under

his girdle a small idol of wood.



<P>'There,' said he, 'that is the God who has guarded me from the day of

my birth. Every one in our country worships the fetish tree,

<BR>from the wood of which this God was made.'



<P>This conversation between the theologian and his slave was listened

to with surprise by the other guests in the coffee-house. They

<BR>were astonished at the master's question, and yet more so at the slave's

reply.



<P>One of them, a Brahmin, on hearing the words spoken by the slave, turned

to him and said:



<P>'Miserable fool! Is it possible you believe that God can be carried

under a man's girdle? There is one God -- Brahma, and he is

<BR>greater than the whole world, for he created it. Brahma is the One,

the mighty God, and in His honour are built the temples on the

<BR>Ganges' banks, where his true priests, the Brahmins, worship him. They

know the true God, and none but they. A thousand score

<BR>of years have passed, and yet through revolution after revolution these

priests have held their sway, because Brahma, the one true

<BR>God, has protected them.'



<P>So spoke the Brahmin, thinking to convince every one; but a Jewish broker

who was present replied to him, and said:



<P>'No! the temple of the true God is not in India. Neither does God protect

the Brahmin caste. The true God is not the God of the

<BR>Brahmins, but of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. None does He protect but

His chosen people, the Israelites. From the

<BR>commencement of the world, our nation has been beloved of Him, and

ours alone. If we are now scattered over the whole earth it

<BR>is but to try us; for God has promised that He will one day gather

His people together in Jerusalem. Then, with the Temple of

<BR>Jerusalem -- the wonder of the ancient world -- restored to its splendour,

shall Israel be established a ruler over all nations.'



<P>So spoke the Jew, and burst into tears. He wished to say more, but an

Italian missionary who was there interrupted him.



<P>'What you are saying is untrue,' said he to the Jew. 'You attribute

injustice to God. He cannot love your nation above the rest. Nay

<BR>rather, even if it be true that of old He favoured the Israelites,

it is now nineteen hundred years since they angered Him, and

<BR>caused Him to destroy their nation and scatter them over the earth,

so that their faith makes no converts and has died out except

<BR>here and there. God shows preference to no nation, but calls all who

wish to be saved to the bosom of the Catholic Church of

<BR>Rome, the one outside whose borders no salvation can be found.'



<P>So spoke the Italian. But a Protestant minister who happened to be present,

growing pale, turned to the Catholic missionary and

<BR>exclaimed:



<P>'How can you say that salvation belongs to your religion? Those only

will be saved, who serve God according to the Gospel, in

<BR>spirit and in truth, as bidden by the word of Christ.'



<P>Then a Turk, an office-holder in the custom-house at Surat, who was

sitting in the coffee-house smoking a pipe, turned with an air

<BR>of superiority to both the Christians.



<P>'Your belief in your Roman religion is vain,' said he. 'It was superseded

twelve hundred years ago by the true faith: that of

<BR>Mohammed! You cannot but observe how the true Mohammedan faith continues

to spread both in Europe and Asia, and even in

<BR>the enlightened country of China. You say yourselves that God has rejected

the Jews; and, as a proof, you quote the fact that the

<BR>Jews are humiliated and their faith does not spread. Confess then the

truth of Mohammedanism, for it is triumphant and spreads

<BR>far and wide. None will be saved but the followers of Mohammed, God's

latest prophet; and of them, only the followers of Omar,

<BR>and not of Ali, for the latter are false to the faith.'



<P>To this the Persian theologian, who was of the sect of Ali, wished to

reply; but by this time a great dispute had arisen among all

<BR>the strangers of different faiths and creeds present. There were Abyssinian

Christians, Llamas from Thibet, Ismailians and

<BR>Fire-worshippers. They all argued about the nature of God, and how

He should be worshipped. Each of them asserted that in his

<BR>country alone was the true God known and rightly worshipped.



<P>Every one argued and shouted, except a Chinaman, a student of Confucius,

who sat quietly in one corner of the coffee-house, not

<BR>joining in the dispute. He sat there drinking tea and listening to

what the others said, but did not speak himself.



<P>The Turk noticed him sitting there, and appealed to him, saying:



<P>'You can confirm what I say, my good Chinaman. You hold your peace,

but if you spoke I know you would uphold my opinion.

<BR>Traders from your country, who come to me for assistance, tell me that

though many religions have been introduced into China,

<BR>you Chinese consider Mohammedanism the best of all, and adopt it willingly.

Confirm, then, my words, and tell us your opinion of

<BR>the true God and of His prophet.'



<P>'Yes, yes,' said the rest, turning to the Chinaman, 'let us hear what

you think on the subject.'



<P>The Chinaman, the student of Confucius, closed his eyes, and thought

a while. Then he opened them again, and drawing his hands

<BR>out of the wide sleeves of his garment, and folding them on his breast,

he spoke as follows, in a calm and quiet voice.



<P>Sirs, it seems to me that it is chiefly pride that prevents men agreeing

with one another on matters of faith. If you care to listen to

<BR>me, I will tell you a story which will explain this by an example.



<P>I came here from China on an English steamer which had been round the

world. We stopped for fresh water, and landed on the

<BR>east coast of the island of Sumatra. It was mid-day, and some of us,

having landed, sat in the shade of some coconut palms by the

<BR>seashore, not far from a native village. We were a party of men of

different nationalities.



<P>As we sat there, a blind man approached us. We learnt afterwards that

he had gone blind from gazing too long and too persistently

<BR>at the sun, trying to find out what it is, in order to seize its light.



<P>He strove a long time to accomplish this, constantly looking at the

sun; but the only result was that his eyes were injured by its

<BR>brightness, and he became blind.



<P>Then he said to himself:



<P>'The light of the sun is not a liquid; for if it were a liquid it would

be possible to pour it from one vessel into another, and it would be

<BR>moved, like water, by the wind. Neither is it fire; for if it were

fire, water would extinguish it. Neither is light a spirit, for it is seen

<BR>by the eye, nor is it matter, for it cannot be moved. Therefore, as

the light of the sun is neither liquid, nor fire, nor spirit, nor matter,

<BR>it is -- nothing!'



<P>So he argued, and, as a result of always looking at the sun and always

thinking about it, he lost both his sight and his reason. And

<BR>when he went quite blind, he became fully convinced that the sun did

not exist.



<P>With this blind man came a slave, who after placing his master in the

shade of a coconut tree, picked up a coconut from the

<BR>ground, and began making it into a night-light. He twisted a wick from

the fibre of the coconut: squeezed oil from the nut into the

<BR>shell, and soaked the wick in it.



<P>As the slave sat doing this, the blind man sighed and said to him:



<P>'Well, slave, was I not right when I told you there is no sun? Do you

not see how dark it is? Yet people say there is a sun. . . . But

<BR>if so, what is it?'



<P>'I do not know what the sun is,' said the slave 'That is no business

of mine. But I know what light is. Here, I have made a

<BR>night-light, by the help of which I can serve you and find anything

I want in the hut.'



<P>And the slave picked up the coconut shell, saying:



<P>'This is my sun.'



<P>A lame man with crutches, who was sitting near by heard these words,

and laughed:



<P>'You have evidently been blind all your life,' said he to the blind

man, 'not to know what the sun is, I will tell you what it is. The sun

<BR>is a ball of fire, which rises every morning out of the sea and goes

down again among the mountains of our island each evening.

<BR>We have all seen this, and if you had had your eyesight you too would

have seen it.'



<P>A fisherman, who had been listening to the conversation, said:



<P>'It is plain enough that you have never been beyond your own island.

If you were not lame, and if you had been out as I have in a

<BR>fishing-boat, you would know that the sun does not set among the mountains

of our island, but as it rises from the ocean every

<BR>morning so it sets again in the sea every night. What I am telling

you is true, for I see it every day with my own eyes.'



<P>Then an Indian who was of our party, interrupted him by saying:



<P>'I am astonished that a reasonable man should talk such nonsense. How

can a ball of fire possibly descend into the water and not

<BR>be extinguished? The sun is not a ball of fire at all, it is the Deity

named Deva who rides for ever in a chariot round the golden

<BR>mountain, Meru. Sometimes the evil serpents Ragu and Ketu attack Deva

and swallow him: and then the earth is dark. But our

<BR>priests pray that the Deity may be released, and then he is set free.

Only such ignorant men as you, who have never been beyond

<BR>their own island, can imagine that the sun shines for their country

alone.'



<P>Then the master of an Egyptian vessel, who was present, spoke in his

turn.



<P>'No,' said he, 'you also are wrong. The sun is not a Deity, and does

not move only round India and its golden mountain. I have

<BR>sailed much on the Black Sea, and along the coasts of Arabia, and have

been to Madagascar and to the Philippines. The sun lights

<BR>the whole earth, and not India alone. It does not circle round one

mountain, but rises far in the east, beyond the Isles of Japan, and

<BR>sets far, far away in the west, beyond the islands of England. That

is why the Japanese call their country "Nippon," that is "the

<BR>birth of the sun." I know this well, for I have myself seen much, and

heard more from my grandfather, who sailed to the very ends

<BR>of the sea.'



<P>He would have gone on, but an English sailor from our ship interrupted

him.



<P>'There is no country,' he said, 'where people know so much about the

sun's movements as in England. The sun, as every one in

<BR>England knows, rises nowhere and sets nowhere. It is always moving

round the earth. We can be sure of this for we have just

<BR>been round the world ourselves, and nowhere knocked up against the

sun. Wherever we went, the sun showed itself in the

<BR>morning and hid itself at night, just as it does here.'



<P>And the Englishman took a stick and, drawing circles on the sand, tried

to explain how the sun moves in the heavens and goes

<BR>round the world. But he was unable to explain it clearly, and pointing

to the ship's pilot said:



<P>'This man knows more about it than I do. He can explain it properly.'



<P>The pilot, who was an intelligent man, had listened in silence to the

talk till he was asked to speak. Now every one turned to him,

<BR>and he said:



<P>'You are all misleading one another, and are yourselves deceived. The

sun does not go round the earth, but the earth goes round

<BR>the sun, revolving as it goes and turning towards the sun in the course

of each twenty-four hours, not only Japan, and the

<BR>Philippines and Sumatra where we now are, but Africa, and Europe and

America, and many lands besides. The sun does not shine

<BR>for some one mountain, or for some one island, or for some one sea,

nor even for one earth alone, but for other planets as well as

<BR>our earth. If you would only look up at the heavens, instead of at

the ground beneath your own feet, you might all understand this,

<BR>and would then no longer suppose that the sun shines for you, or for

your country alone.'



<P>Thus spoke the wise pilot, who had voyaged much about the world, and

had gazed much upon the heavens above.



<P>'So on matters of faith,' continued the Chinaman the student of Confucius,

'it is pride that causes error and discord among men. As

<BR>with the sun, so it is with God. Each man wants to have a special God

of his own, or at least a special God for his native land.

<BR>Each nation wishes to confine in its own temples Him, whom the world

cannot contain.



<P>'Can any temple compare with that which God Himself has built to unite

all men in one faith and one religion?



<P>'All human temples are built on the model of this temple, which is God's

own world. Every temple has its fonts, its vaulted roof, its

<BR>lamps, its pictures or sculptures, its inscriptions, its books of the

law, its offerings, its altars and its priests. But in what temple is

<BR>there such a font as the ocean; such a vault as that of the heavens;

such lamps as the sun, moon, and stars; or any figures to be

<BR>compared with living, loving, mutually-helpful men? Where are there

any records of God's goodness so easy to understand as the

<BR>blessings which God has strewn abroad for man's happiness? Where is

there any book of the law so clear to each man as that

<BR>written in his heart? What sacrifices equal the self-denials which

loving men and women make for one another? And what altar

<BR>can be compared with the heart of a good man, on which God Himself

accepts the sacrifice?



<P>'The higher a man's conception of God, the better will he know Him.

And the better he knows God, the nearer will he draw to

<BR>Him, imitating His goodness, His mercy, and His love of man.



<P>'Therefore, let him who sees the sun's whole light filling the world,

refrain from blaming or despising the superstitious man, who in

<BR>his own idol sees one ray of that same light. Let him not despise even

the unbeliever who is blind and cannot see the sun at all.'



<P>So spoke the Chinaman, the student of Confucius; and all who were present

in the coffee-house were silent, and disputed no more

<BR>as to whose faith was the best.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>THE STORY OF IV&Aacute;N THE FOOL</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>AND OF HIS TWO BROTHERS, SIMON THE SOLDIER AND TAR&Aacute;S THE STOUT;

AND OF HIS DUMB SISTER

<BR>MARTHA, AND OF THE OLD DEVIL AND THE THREE LITTLE IMPS.



<P>ONCE upon a time, in a certain province of a certain country, there

lived a rich peasant, who had three sons: Simon the Soldier,

<BR>Tar&aacute;s the Stout, and Iv&aacute;n the Fool, besides an unmarried

daughter, Martha, who was deaf and dumb. Simon the Soldier went to

<BR>the wars to serve the king; Tar&aacute;s the Stout went to a merchant's

in town to trade, and Iv&aacute;n the Fool stayed at home with the lass,

<BR>to till the ground till his back bent.



<P>Simon the Soldier obtained high rank and an estate, and married a nobleman's

daughter. His pay was large and his estate was

<BR>large, but yet he could not make ends meet. What the husband earned

his lady wife squandered, and they never had money

<BR>enough.



<P>So Simon the Soldier went to his estate to collect the income, but his

steward said, 'where is any income to come from? We have

<BR>neither cattle, nor tools, nor horse, nor plough, nor harrow. We must

first get all these, and then the money will come.'



<P>Then Simon the Soldier went to his father and said: 'You, father, are

rich, but have given me nothing. Divide what you have, and

<BR>give me a third part, that I may improve my estate.'



<P>But the old man said: 'You brought nothing into my house; why should

I give you a third part? It would be unfair to Iv&aacute;n and to the

<BR>girl.'



<P>But Simon answered, 'He is a fool; and she is an old maid, and deaf

and dumb besides; what's the good of property to them?'



<P>The old man said, 'We will see what Iv&aacute;n says about it.'



<P>And Iv&aacute;n said, 'Let him take what he wants.'



<P>So Simon the Soldier took his share of his father's goods and removed

them to his estate, and went off again to serve the king.



<P>Tar&aacute;s the Stout also gathered much money, and married into a

merchant's family, but still he wanted more. So he, also, came to his

<BR>father and said, 'Give me my portion.'



<P>But the old man did not wish to give Tar&aacute;s a share either, and

said, 'You brought nothing here. Iv&aacute;n has earned all we have in

the

<BR>house, and why should we wrong him and the girl?'



<P>But Tar&aacute;s said, 'What does he need? He is a fool! He cannot marry,

no one would have him; and the dumb lass does not need

<BR>anything either. Look here, Iv&aacute;n!' said he, 'give me half the

corn; I don't want the tools, and of the live stock I will take only the

<BR>grey stallion, which is of no use to you for the plough.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n laughed and said, 'Take what you want. I will work to earn

some more.'



<P>So they gave a share to Tar&aacute;s also, and he carted the corn away

to town, and took the grey stallion. And Iv&aacute;n was left with one

<BR>old mare, to lead his peasant life as before, and to support his father

and mother.



<P>II



<P>Now the old Devil was vexed that the brothers had not quarrelled over

the division, but had parted peacefully; and he summoned

<BR>three imps.



<P>'Look here,' said he, 'there are three brothers Simon the Soldier, Tar&aacute;s

the Stout, and Iv&aacute;n the Fool. They should have quarrelled,

<BR>but are living peaceably and meet on friendly terms. The fool Iv&aacute;n

has spoilt the whole business for me. Now you three go and

<BR>tackle those three brothers, and worry them till they scratch each

other's eyes out! Do you think you can do it?'



<P>'Yes, we'll do it,' said they.



<P>'How will you set about it?'



<P>'Why,' said they, 'first we'll ruin them. And when they haven't a crust

to eat we'll tie them up together, and then they'll fight each

<BR>other, sure enough!'



<P>'That's capital; I see you understand your business. Go, and don't come

back till you've set them by the ears, or I'll skin you alive!'



<P>The imps went off into a swamp, and began to consider how they should

set to work. They disputed and disputed, each wanting

<BR>the lightest job; but at last they decided to cast lots which of the

brothers each imp should tackle. If one imp finished his task

<BR>before the others, he was to come and help them. So the imps cast lots,

and appointed a time to meet again in the swamp to learn

<BR>who had succeeded and who needed help.



<P>The appointed time came round, and the imps met again in the swamp as

agreed. And each began to tell how matters stood. The

<BR>first, who had undertaken Simon the Soldier, began: 'My business is

going on well. To-morrow Simon will return to his father's

<BR>house.'



<P>His comrades asked, 'How did you manage it?'



<P>'First,' says he, 'I made Simon so bold that he offered to conquer the

whole world for his king; and the king made him his general

<BR>and sent him to fight the King of India. They met for battle, but the

night before, I damped all the powder in Simon's camp, and

<BR>made more straw soldiers for the Indian King than you could count.

And when Simon's soldiers saw the straw soldiers surrounding

<BR>them, they grew frightened. Simon ordered them to fire; but their cannons

and guns would not go off. Then Simon's soldiers were

<BR>quite frightened, and ran like sheep, and the Indian King slaughtered

them. Simon was disgraced. He has been deprived of his

<BR>estate, and to-morrow they intend to execute him. There is only one

day's work left for me to do; I have just to let him out of

<BR>prison that he may escape home. To-morrow I shall be ready to help

whichever of you needs me.



<P>Then the second imp, who had Tar&aacute;s in hand, began to tell how

he had fared. 'I don't want any help,' said he, 'my job is going all

<BR>right. Tar&aacute;s can't hold out for more than a week. First I caused

him to grow greedy and fat. His covetousness became so great

<BR>that whatever he saw he wanted to buy. He has spent all his money in

buying immense lots of goods, and still continues to buy.

<BR>Already he has begun to use borrowed money. His debts hang like a weight

round his neck, and he is so involved that he can

<BR>never get clear. In a week his bills come due, and before then I will

spoil all his stock. He will be unable to pay and will have to go

<BR>home to his father.'



<P>Then they asked the third imp (Ivan's), 'And how are you getting on?'



<P>'Well,' said he, 'my affair goes badly. First I spat into his drink

to make his stomach ache, and then I went into his field and

<BR>hammered the ground hard as a stone that he should not be able to till

it. I thought he wouldn't plough it, but like the fool that he is,

<BR>he came with his plough and began to make a furrow. He groaned with

the pain in his stomach, but went on ploughing. I broke his

<BR>plough for him, but he went home, got out another, and again started

ploughing. I crept under the earth and caught hold of the

<BR>ploughshares, but there was no holding them; he leant heavily upon

the plough, and the ploughshare was sharp and cut my hands.

<BR>He has all but finished ploughing the field, only one little strip

is left. Come brothers, and help me; for if we don't get the better of

<BR>him, all our labour is lost. If the fool holds out and keeps on working

the land, his brothers will never know want, for he will feed

<BR>them both.'



<P>Simon the Soldier's imp promised to come next day to help, and so they

parted.



<P>III



<P>Iv&aacute;n had ploughed up the whole fallow, all but one little strip.

He came to finish it. Though his stomach ached, the ploughing must

<BR>be done. He freed the harness ropes, turned the plough, and began to

work. He drove one furrow, but coming back the plough

<BR>began to drag as if it had caught in a root. It was the imp, who had

twisted his legs round the ploughshare and was holding it back.



<P>'What a strange thing!' thought Iv&aacute;n. 'There were no roots here

at all, and yet here's a root.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n pushed his hand deep into the furrow, groped about, and,

feeling something soft, seized hold of it and pulled it out. It was

<BR>black like a root, but it wriggled. Why, it was a live imp!



<P>'What a nasty thing!' said Iv&aacute;n, and he lifted his hand to dash

it against the plough, but the imp squealed out:



<P>'Don't hurt me, and I'll do anything you tell me to.'



<P>'What can you do?'



<P>'Anything you tell me to.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n scratched his head.



<P>'My stomach aches,' said he; 'can you cure that?'



<P>'Certainly I can.'



<P>'Well then, do so.'



<P>The imp went down into the furrow, searched about scratched with his

claws, and pulled out a bunch of three little roots, which he

<BR>handed to Iv&aacute;n.



<P>'Here,' says he, 'whoever swallows one of these will be cured of any

illness.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n took the roots, separated them, and swallowed one. The pain

in his stomach was cured at once. The imp again begged to be

<BR>let off; 'I will jump right into the earth, and never come back,' said

he.



<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n; 'begone, and God be with you!'



<P>And as soon as Iv&aacute;n mentioned God, the imp plunged into the earth

like a stone thrown into the water. Only a hole was left.



<P>Iv&aacute;n put the other two pieces of root into his cap and went on

with his ploughing. He ploughed the strip to the end, turned his

<BR>plough over, and went home. He unharnessed the horse, entered the hut,

and there he saw his elder brother, Simon the Soldier and

<BR>his wife, sitting at supper. Simon's estate had been confiscated, he

himself had barely managed to escape from prison, and he had

<BR>come back to live in his father's house.



<P>Simon saw Iv&aacute;n, and said: 'I have come to live with you. Feed

me and my wife till I get another appointment.'



<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'you can stay with us.'



<P>But when Iv&aacute;n was about to sit down on the bench the lady disliked

the smell, and said to her husband. 'I cannot sup with a dirty

<BR>peasant.'



<P>So Simon the Soldier said, 'My lady says you don't smell nice. You'd

better go and eat outside.'



<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n; 'any way I must spend the night outside,

for I have to pasture the mare.'



<P>So he took some bread, and his coat, and went with the mare into the

fields.



<P>IV



<P>Having finished his work that night, Simon's imp came, as agreed, to

find Iv&aacute;n's imp and help him to subdue the fool. He came to

<BR>the field and searched and searched; but instead of his comrade he

found only a hole.



<P>'Clearly,' thought he, 'some evil has befallen my comrade. I must take

his place. The field is ploughed up, so the fool must be

<BR>tackled in the meadow.'



<P>So the imp went to the meadows and flooded Iv&aacute;n's hayfield with

water, which left the grass all covered with mud.



<P>Iv&aacute;n returned from the pasture at dawn, sharpened his scythe,

and went to mow the hayfield. He began to mow but had only

<BR>swung the scythe once or twice when the edge turned so that it would

not cut at all, but needed resharpening. Iv&aacute;n struggled on

<BR>for awhile, and then said: 'It's no good. I must go home and bring

a tool to straighten the scythe, and I'll get a chunk of bread at the

<BR>same time. If I have to spend a week here, I won't leave till the mowing's

done.'



<P>The imp heard this and thought to himself, 'This fool is a tough 'un;

I can't get round him this way. I must try some other dodge.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n returned, sharpened his scythe, and began to mow. The imp

crept into the grass and began to catch the scythe by the heel,

<BR>sending the point into the earth. Iv&aacute;n found the work very hard,

but he mowed the whole meadow, except one little bit which was

<BR>in the swamp. The imp crept into the swamp and, thought he to himself,

'Though I cut my paws I will not let him mow.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n reached the swamp. The grass didn't seem thick, but yet

it resisted the scythe. Iv&aacute;n grew angry and began to swing the

<BR>scythe with all his might. The imp had to give in; he could not keep

up with the scythe, and, seeing it was a bad business, he

<BR>scrambled into a bush. Iv&aacute;n swung the scythe, caught the bush,

and cut off half the imp's tail. Then he finished mowing the grass,

<BR>told his sister to rake it up, and went himself to mow the rye. He

went with the scythe, but the dock-tailed imp was there first, and

<BR>entangled the rye so that the scythe was of no use. But Iv&aacute;n

went home and got his sickle, and began to reap with that and he

<BR>reaped the whole of the rye.



<P>'Now it's time,' said he, 'to start on the oats.'



<P>The dock-tailed imp heard this, and thought, 'I couldn't get the better

of him on the rye, but I shall on the oats. Only wait till the

<BR>morning.'



<P>In the morning the imp hurried to the oat field, but the oats were already

mowed down! Iv&aacute;n had mowed them by night, in order

<BR>that less grain should shake out. The imp grew angry.



<P>'He has cut me all over and tired me out -- the fool. It is worse than

war. The accursed fool never sleeps; one can't keep up with

<BR>him. I will get into his stacks now and rot them.'



<P>So the imp entered the rye, and crept among the sheaves, and they began

to rot. He heated them, grew warm himself, and fell

<BR>asleep.



<P>Iv&aacute;n harnessed the mare, and went with the lass to cart the rye.

He came to the heaps, and began to pitch the rye into the cart.

<BR>He tossed two sheaves and again thrust his fork -- right into the imp's

back. He lifts the fork and sees on the prongs a live imp;

<BR>dock-tailed, struggling, wriggling, and trying to jump.



<P>'What, you nasty thing, are you here again?'



<P>'I'm another,' said the imp. 'The first was my brother. I've been with

your brother Simon.'



<P>'Well,' said Iv&aacute;n, whoever you are, you've met the same fate!'



<P>He was about to dash him against the cart, but the imp cried out: 'Let

me off, and I will not only let you alone, but I'll do anything

<BR>you tell me to do.'



<P>'What can you do?'



<P>'I can make soldiers out of anything you like.'



<P>'But what use are they?'



<P>'You can turn them to any use; they can do anything you please.'



<P>'Can they sing?'



<P>'Yes, if you want them to.'



<P>'All right; you may make me some.'



<P>And the imp said, 'Here, take a sheaf of rye, then bump it upright on

the ground, and simply say:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'O sheaf! my slave

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This order gave:

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a straw has been

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let a soldier be seen!'



<P>Iv&aacute;n took the sheaf, struck it on the ground, and said what the

imp had told him to. The sheaf fell asunder, and all the straws

<BR>changed into soldiers, with a trumpeter and a drummer playing in front,

so that there was a whole regiment.



<P>Iv&aacute;n laughed.



<P>'How clever!' said he. 'This is fine! How pleased the girls will be!'



<P>'Now let me go,' said the imp.



<P>'No,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'I must make my soldiers of thrashed straw,

otherwise good grain will be wasted. Teach me how to change them

<BR>back again into the sheaf. I want to thrash it.'



<P>And the imp said, 'Repeat:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let each be a straw

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who was soldier before,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my true slave

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This order gave!"'



<P>Iv&aacute;n said this, and the sheaf reappeared.



<P>Again the imp began to beg, 'Now let me go!



<P>'All right.' And Iv&aacute;n pressed him against the side of the cart,

held him down with his hand, and pulled him off the fork.



<P>'God be with you,' said he.



<P>And as soon as he mentioned God, the imp plunged into the earth like

a stone into water. Only a hole was left.



<P>Iv&aacute;n returned home, and there was his other brother, Tar&aacute;s

with his wife, sitting at supper.



<P>Taras the Stout had failed to pay his debts, had run away from his creditors,

and had come home to his father's house. When he

<BR>saw Iv&aacute;n, 'Look here', said he, 'till I can start in business

again, I want you to keep me and my wife.'



<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'you can live here, if you like.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n took off his coat and sat down to table, but the merchant's

wife said: 'I cannot sit at table with this clown, he smells of

<BR>perspiration.'



<P>Then Tar&aacute;s the Stout said, 'Iv&aacute;n, you smell too strong.

Go and eat outside.'



<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, taking some bread and going into the

yard. 'It is time, anyhow, for me to go and pasture the mare.'



<P>V



<P>Tar&aacute;s's imp, being also free that night, came, as agreed, to

help his comrades subdue Iv&aacute;n the Fool. He came to the cornfield,

<BR>looked and looked for his comrades -- no one was there. He only found

a hole. He went to the meadow, and there he found an

<BR>imp's tail in the swamp, and another hole in the rye stubble.



<P>'Evidently, some ill-luck has befallen my comrades,' thought he. 'I

must take their place and tackle the fool.'



<P>So the imp went to look for Iv&aacute;n, who had already stacked the

corn and was cutting trees in the wood. The two brothers had

<BR>begun to feel crowded, living together, and had told Iv&aacute;n to

cut down trees to build new houses for them.



<P>The imp ran to the wood, climbed among the branches, and began to hinder

Iv&aacute;n from felling the trees. Iv&aacute;n undercut one tree so

<BR>that it should fall clear, but in falling it turned askew and caught

among some branches. Iv&aacute;n cut a pole with which to lever it aside,

<BR>and with difficulty contrived to bring it to the ground. He set to

work to fell another tree -- again the same thing occurred; and with

<BR>all his efforts he could hardly get the tree clear. He began on a third

tree, and again the same thing happened.



<P>Iv&aacute;n had hoped to cut down half a hundred small trees, but had

not felled even half a score, and now the night was come and he

<BR>was tired out. The steam from him spread like a mist through the wood,

but still he stuck to his work. He undercut another tree,

<BR>but his back began to ache so that he could not stand. He drove his

axe into the tree and sat down to rest.



<P>The imp, noticing that Iv&aacute;n had stopped work, grew cheerful.



<P>'At last,' thought he, 'he is tired out! He will give it up. Now I can

take a rest myself.'



<P>He seated himself astride a branch and chuckled. But soon Iv&aacute;n

got up, pulled the axe out, swung it and smote the tree from the

<BR>opposite side with such force that the tree gave way at once and came

crashing down. The imp had not expected this, and had no

<BR>time to get his feet clear, and the tree in breaking, gripped his paw.

Iv&aacute;n began to lop off the branches, when he noticed a live imp

<BR>hanging in the tree! Iv&aacute;n was surprised.



<P>'What, you nasty thing,' says he, 'so you are here again!'



<P>'I am another one,' says the imp. 'I have been with your brother Tar&aacute;s.'



<P>'Whoever you are you have met your fate,' said Iv&aacute;n, and swinging

his axe he was about to strike him with the haft, but the imp

<BR>begged for mercy: 'Don't strike me,' said he, 'and I will do anything

you tell me to.'



<P>'What can you do?'



<P>'I can make money for you, as much as you want.'



<P>'All right, make some.' So the imp showed him how to do it.



<P>'Take,' said he, 'some leaves from this oak and rub them in your hands,

and gold will fall out on the ground.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n took some leaves and rubbed them, and gold ran down from

his hands.



<P>'This stuff will do fine,' said he, 'for the fellows to play with on

their holidays.'



<P>'Now let me go.' said the imp.



<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, and taking a lever he set the imp free.

'Now begone! And God be with you,' says he.



<P>And as soon as he mentioned God, the imp plunged into the earth, like

a stone into water. Only a hole was left.



<P>VI



<P>So the brothers built houses, and began to live apart; and Iv&aacute;n

finished the harvest work, brewed beer, and invited his brothers to

<BR>spend the next holiday with him. His brothers would not come.



<P>'We don't care about peasant feasts,' said they.



<P>So Iv&aacute;n entertained the peasants and their wives, and drank until

he was rather tipsy. Then he went into the street to a ring of

<BR>dancers; and going up to them he told the women to sing a song in his

honour; 'for,' said he, 'I will give you something you never

<BR>saw in your lives before!'



<P>The women laughed and sang his praises, and when they had finished they

said, 'Now let us have your gift.'



<P>'I will bring it directly,' said he.



<P>He took a seed-basket and ran into the woods. The women laughed. 'He

is a fool!' said they, and they began to talk of something

<BR>else.



<P>But soon Iv&aacute;n came running back, carrying the basket full of

something heavy.



<P>'Shall I give it you?'



<P>'Yes! give it to us.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n took a handful of gold and threw it to the women. You should

have seen them throw themselves upon it to pick it up! And the

<BR>men around scrambled for it, and snatched it from one another. One

old woman was nearly crushed to death. Iv&aacute;n laughed.



<P>'Oh, you fools!' says he. 'Why did you crush the old grandmother? Be

quiet, and I will give you some more,' and he threw them

<BR>some more. The people all crowded round, and Iv&aacute;n threw them

all the gold he had. They asked for more, but Iv&aacute;n said, 'I have

no

<BR>more just now. Another time I'll give you some more. Now let us dance,

and you can sing me your songs.'



<P>The women began to sing.



<P>'Your songs are no good,' says he.



<P>'Where will you find better ones?' say they.



<P>'I'll soon show you,' says he.



<P>He went to the barn, took a sheaf, thrashed it, stood it up, and bumped

it on the ground.



<P>'Now,' said he:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'O sheaf! my slave

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This order gave:

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a straw has been

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let a soldier be seen!'



<P>And the sheaf fell asunder and became so many soldiers. The drums and

trumpets began to play. Iv&aacute;n ordered the soldiers to play

<BR>and sing. He led them out into the street, and the people were amazed,

The soldiers played and sang, and then Iv&aacute;n (forbidding any

<BR>one to follow him) led them back to the thrashing ground, changed them

into a sheaf again, and threw it in its place.



<P>He then went home and lay down in the stables to sleep.



<P>VII



<P>Simon the Soldier heard of all these things next morning, and went to

his brother.



<P>'Tell me,' says he, 'where you got those soldiers from, and where you

have taken them to?'



<P>'What does it matter to you?' said Iv&aacute;n.



<P>'What does it matter? Why, with soldiers one can do anything. One can

win a kingdom.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n wondered.



<P>'Really!' said he; 'Why didn't you say so before? I'll make you as many

as you like. It's well the lass and I have thrashed so much

<BR>straw.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n took his brother to the barn and said:



<P>'Look here; if I make you some soldiers, you must take them away at

once, for if we have to feed them, they will eat up the whole

<BR>village in a day.'



<P>Simon the Soldier promised to lead the soldiers away; and Iv&aacute;n

began to make them. He bumped a sheaf on the thrashing floor --

<BR>a company appeared. He bumped another sheaf, and there was a second

company. He made so many that they covered the field.



<P>'Will that do?' he asked.



<P>Simon was overjoyed, and said: 'That will do! Thank you, Iv&aacute;n!'



<P>'All right' said Iv&aacute;n. 'If you want more, come back, and I'll

make them. There is plenty of straw this season.'



<P>Simon the Soldier at once took command of his army, collected and organized

it, and went off to make war.



<P>Hardly had Simon the Soldier gone, when Tar&aacute;s the Stout came

along. He, too, had heard of yesterday's affair, and he said to his

<BR>brother:



<P>'Show me where you get gold money! If I only had some to start with,

I could make it bring me in money from all over the world.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n was astonished.



<P>'Really!' said he. 'You should have told me sooner. I will make you

as much as you like.'



<P>His brother was delighted.



<P>'Give me three baskets-full to begin with.'



<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n. 'Come into the forest; or better still,

let us harness the mare, for you won't be able to carry it all.'



<P>They drove to the forest, and Iv&aacute;n began to rub the oak leaves.

He made a great heap of gold.



<P>'Will that do?'



<P>Tar&aacute;s was overjoyed.



<P>'It will do for the present,' said he. 'Thank you, Iv&aacute;n!'



<P>'All right,' says Iv&aacute;n, 'if you want more, come back for it.

There are plenty of leaves left.'



<P>Tar&aacute;s the Stout gathered up a whole cartload of money, and went

off to trade.



<P>So the two brothers went away: Simon to fight and Tar&aacute;s to buy

and sell. And Simon the Soldier conquered a kingdom for himself;

<BR>and Tar&aacute;s the Stout made much money in trade.



<P>When the two brothers met, each told the other: Simon how he got the

soldiers, and Tar&aacute;s how he got the money. And Simon the

<BR>Soldier said to his brother, I have conquered a kingdom and live in

grand style but I have not money enough to keep my soldiers.'



<P>And Tar&aacute;s the Stout said, 'And I have made much money, but the

trouble is, I have no one to guard it.'



<P>Then said Simon the Soldier, 'Let us go to our brother. I will tell

him to make more soldiers, and will give them to you to guard your

<BR>money, and you can tell him to make money for me to feed my men.



<P>And they drove away to Iv&aacute;n; and Simon said, 'Dear brother, I

have not enough soldiers; make me another couple of ricks or so.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n shook his head.



<P>'No!' says he' 'I will not make any more soldiers.'



<P>'But you promised you would.'



<P>'I know I promised, but I won't make any more.'



<P>'But why not, fool?'



<P>'Because your soldiers killed a man. I was ploughing the other day near

the road, and I saw a woman taking a coffin along in a

<BR>cart, and crying. I asked her who was dead. She said, "Simon's soldiers

have killed my husband in the war." I thought the soldiers

<BR>would only play tunes, but they have killed a man. I won't give you

any more.'



<P>And he stuck to it, and would not make any more soldiers.



<P>Tar&aacute;s the Stout, too, began to beg Iv&aacute;n to make him more

gold money. But Iv&aacute;n shook his head.



<P>'No, I won't make any more,' said he.



<P>'Didn't you promise?'



<P>'I did, but I'll make no more,' said he.



<P>'Why not, fool?'



<P>'Because your gold coins took away the cow from Michael's daughter.'



<P>'How?'



<P>'Simply took it away! Michael's daughter had a cow. Her children used

to drink the milk. But the other day her children came to

<BR>me to ask for milk. I said, "Where's your cow?" They answered, "The

steward of Tar&aacute;s the Stout came and gave mother three

<BR>bits of gold, and she gave him the cow, so we have nothing to drink."

I thought you were only going to play with the gold pieces,

<BR>but you have taken the children's cow away. I will not give you any

more.'



<P>And Iv&aacute;n stuck to it and would not give him any more. So the

brothers went away. And as they went they discussed how they

<BR>could meet their difficulties. And Simon said:



<P>'Look here, I tell you what to do. You give me money to feed my soldiers,

and I will give you half my kingdom with soldiers

<BR>enough to guard your money.' Tar&aacute;s agreed. So the brothers divided

what they possessed, and both became kings, and both were

<BR>rich.



<P>VIII



<P>Iv&aacute;n lived at home, supporting his father and mother and working

in the fields with his dumb sister. Now it happened that Iv&aacute;n's

<BR>yard-dog fell sick, grew mangy, and was near dying. Iv&aacute;n, pitying

it, got some bread from his sister, put it in his cap, carried it out,

<BR>and threw it to the dog. But the cap was torn, and together with the

bread one of the little roots fell to the ground. The old dog ate

<BR>it up with the bread, and as soon as she had swallowed it she jumped

up and began to play, bark, and wag her tail -- in short

<BR>became quite well again.



<P>The father and mother saw it and were amazed.



<P>'How did you cure the dog?' asked they.



<P>Iv&aacute;n answered: 'I had two little roots to cure any pain, and

she swallowed one.'



<P>Now about that time it happened that the King's daughter fell ill, and

the King proclaimed in every town and village, that he would

<BR>reward any one who could heal her, and if any unmarried man could heal

the King's daughter he should have her for his wife. This

<BR>was proclaimed in Ivan's village as well as everywhere else.



<P>His father and mother called Iv&aacute;n, and said to him: 'Have you

heard what the King has proclaimed? You said you had a root that

<BR>would cure any sickness. Go and heal the King's daughter, and you will

be made happy for life.'



<P>'All right,' said he.



<P>And Iv&aacute;n prepared to go, and they dressed him in his best. But

as he went out of the door he met a beggar woman with a crippled

<BR>hand.



<P>'I have heard,' said she, 'that you can heal people. I pray you cure

my arm, for I cannot even put on my boots myself.'



<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, and giving the little root to the beggar

woman he told her to swallow it. She swallowed it, and was cured. She

<BR>was at once able to move her arm freely.



<P>His father and mother came out to accompany Iv&aacute;n to the King,

but when they heard that he had given away the root, and that he

<BR>had nothing left to cure the King's daughter with, they began to scold

him.



<P>'You pity a beggar woman, but are not sorry for the King's daughter!'

said they. But Iv&aacute;n felt sorry for the King's daughter also.

<BR>So he harnessed the horse, put straw in the cart to sit on, and sat

down to drive away.



<P>'Where are you going, fool?'



<P>'To cure the King's daughter.'



<P>'But you've nothing left to cure her with?'



<P>'Never mind,' said he, and drove off.



<P>He drove to the King's palace, and as soon as he stepped on the threshold

the King's daughter got well.



<P>The King was delighted, and had Iv&aacute;n brought to him, and had

him dressed in fine robes.



<P>'Be my son-in-law,' said he.



<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n.



<P>And Iv&aacute;n married the Princess. Her father died soon after, and

Iv&aacute;n became King. So all three brothers were now kings.



<P>IX



<P>The three brothers lived and reigned. The eldest brother, Simon the

Soldier, prospered. With his straw soldiers he levied real

<BR>soldiers. He ordered throughout his whole kingdom a levy of one soldier

from every ten houses, and each soldier had to be tall, and

<BR>clean in body and in face. He gathered many such soldiers and trained

them; and when any one opposed him, he sent these

<BR>soldiers at once, and got his own way, so that every one began to fear

him, and his life was a comfortable one. Whatever he cast

<BR>his eyes on and wished for, was his. He sent soldiers, and they brought

him all he desired.



<P>Tar&aacute;s the Stout also lived comfortably. He did not waste the

money he got from Iv&aacute;n, but increased it largely. He introduced

law

<BR>and order into his kingdom. He kept his money in coffers, and taxed

the people. He instituted a poll-tax, tolls for walking and

<BR>driving, and a tax on shoes and stockings and dress trimmings. And

whatever he wished for he got. For the sake of money, people

<BR>brought him everything, and they offered to work for him -- for every

one wanted money.



<P>Iv&aacute;n the Fool, also, did not live badly. As soon as he had buried

his father-in-law, he took off all his royal robes and gave them to

<BR>his wife to put away in a chest; and he again donned his hempen shirt,

his breeches and peasant shoes, and started again to work.



<P>'It's dull for me,' said he. 'I'm getting fat and have lost my appetite

and my sleep.' So he brought his father and mother and his

<BR>dumb sister to live with him, and worked as before.



<P>People said, 'But you are a king!'



<P>'Yes,' said he, 'but even a king must eat.'



<P>One of his ministers came to him and said, 'We have no money to pay

salaries.'



<P>'All right,' says he, 'then don't pay them.'



<P>'Then no one will serve.'



<P>'All right; let them not serve. They will have more time to work; let

them cart manure. There is plenty of scavenging to be done.'



<P>And people came to Iv&aacute;n to be tried. One said. 'He stole my money.'

And Iv&aacute;n said, 'All right, that shows that he wanted it.'



<P>And they all got to know that Iv&aacute;n was a fool. And his wife said

to him, 'People say that you are a fool.'



<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n.



<P>His wife thought and thought about it, but she also was a fool.



<P>'Shall I go against my husband? Where the needle goes the thread follows,'

said she.



<P>So she took off her royal dress, put it away in a chest, and went to

the dumb girl to learn to work. And she learned to work and

<BR>began to help her husband.



<P>And all the wise men left Iv&aacute;n's kingdom; only the fools remained.



<P>Nobody had money. They lived and worked. They fed themselves; and they

fed others.



<P>The old Devil waited and waited for news from the imps of their having

ruined the three brothers. But no news came. So he went

<BR>himself to inquire about it. He searched and searched, but instead

of finding the three imps he found only the three holes.



<P>'Evidently they have failed,' thought he. 'I shall have to tackle it

myself.'



<P>So he went to look for the brothers, but they were no longer in their

old places. He found them in three different kingdoms. All

<BR>three were living and reigning. This annoyed the old Devil very much.



<P>'Well,' said he, 'I must try my own hand at the job.'



<P>First he went to King Simon. He did not go to him in his own shape,

but disguised himself as a general, and drove to Simon's

<BR>palace.



<P>'I hear, King Simon,' said he, 'that you are a great warrior, and as

I know that business well, I desire to serve you.'



<P>King Simon questioned him, and seeing that he was a wise man, took him

into his service.



<P>The new commander began to teach King Simon how to form a strong army.



<P>'First,' said he, 'we must levy more soldiers, for there are in your

kingdom many people unemployed. We must recruit all the young

<BR>men without exception. Then you will have five times as many soldiers

as formerly. Secondly, we must get new rifles and

<BR>cannons. I will introduce rifles that will fire a hundred balls at

once; they will fly out like peas. And I will get cannons that will

<BR>consume with fire either man, or horse, or wall. They will burn up

everything!'



<P>Simon the King listened to the new commander, ordered all young men

without exception to be enrolled as soldiers, and had new

<BR>factories built in which he manufactured large quantities of improved

rifles and cannons. Then he made haste to declare war

<BR>against a neighbouring king. As soon as he met the other army, King

Simon ordered his soldiers to rain balls against it and shoot

<BR>fire from the cannons, and at one blow he burned and crippled half

the enemy's army. The neighbouring king was so thoroughly

<BR>frightened that he gave way and surrendered his kingdom. King Simon

was delighted.



<P>'Now,' said he, 'I will conquer the King of India.'



<P>But the Indian King had heard about King Simon and had adopted all his

inventions, and added more of his own. The Indian King

<BR>enlisted not only all the young men, but all the single women also,

and got together a greater army even than King Simon's. And he

<BR>copied all King Simon's rifles and cannons, and invented a way of flying

through the air to throw explosive bombs from above.



<P>King Simon set out to fight the Indian King, expecting to beat him as

he had beaten the other king; but the scythe that had cut so

<BR>well had lost its edge. The King of India did not let Simon's army

come within gunshot, but sent his women through the air to hurl

<BR>down explosive bombs on to Simon's army. The women began to rain down

bombs on to the army like borax upon cockroaches.

<BR>The army ran away, and Simon the King was left alone. So the Indian

King took Simon's kingdom, and Simon the Soldier fled as

<BR>best he might.



<P>Having finished with this brother, the old Devil went to King Tar&aacute;s.

Changing himself into a merchant, he settled in Tar&aacute;s's

<BR>kingdom, started a house of business, and began spending money. He

paid high prices for everything, and everybody hurried to the

<BR>new merchant's to get money. And so much money spread among the people

that they began to pay all their taxes promptly, and

<BR>paid up all their arrears, and King Tar&aacute;s rejoiced.



<P>'Thanks to the new merchant,' thought he, 'I shall have more money than

ever; and my life will be yet more comfortable.'



<P>And Tar&aacute;s the King began to form fresh plans, and began to build

a new palace. He gave notice that people should bring him

<BR>wood and stone, and come to work, and he fixed high prices for everything.

King Tar&aacute;s thought people would come in crowds to

<BR>work as before, but to his surprise all the wood and stone was taken

to the merchant's, and all the workmen went there too. King

<BR>Tar&aacute;s increased his price, but the merchant bid yet more. King

Tar&aacute;s had much money, but the merchant had still more, and outbid

<BR>the King at every point.



<P>The King's palace was at a standstill; the building did not get on.



<P>King Tar&aacute;s planned a garden, and when autumn came he called for

the people to come and plant the garden, but nobody came. All

<BR>the people were engaged digging a pond for the merchant. Winter came,

and King Tar&aacute;s wanted to buy sable furs for a new

<BR>overcoat. He sent to buy them, but the messengers returned and said,

'There are no sables left. The merchant has all the furs. He

<BR>gave the best price, and made carpets of the skins.'



<P>King Tar&aacute;s wanted to buy some stallions. He sent to buy them,

but the messengers returned saying, 'The merchant has all the

<BR>good stallions; they are carrying water to fill his pond.



<P>All the King's affairs came to a standstill. Nobody would work for him,

for every one was busy working for the merchant; and

<BR>they only brought King Tar&aacute;s the merchant's money to pay their

taxes.



<P>And the King collected so much money that he had nowhere to store it,

and his life became wretched. He ceased to form plans,

<BR>and would have been glad enough simply to live, but he was hardly able

even to do that. He ran short of everything. One after

<BR>another his cooks, coachmen, and servants left him to go to the merchant.

Soon he lacked even food. When he sent to the market

<BR>to buy anything, there was nothing to be got -- the merchant had bought

up everything, and people only brought the King money to

<BR>pay their taxes.



<P>Tar&aacute;s the King got angry and banished the merchant from the country.

But the merchant settled just across the frontier, and went

<BR>on as before. For the sake of the merchant's money, people took everything

to him instead of to the King.



<P>Things went badly with King Tar&aacute;s. For days together he had nothing

to eat, and a rumour even got about that the merchant was

<BR>boasting that he would buy up the King himself! King Tar&aacute;s got

frightened, and did not know what to do.



<P>At this time Simon the Soldier came to him, saying, 'Help me, for the

King of India has conquered me.'



<P>But King Tar&aacute;s himself was over head and ears in difficulties.

'I myself,' said he, 'have had nothing to eat for two days.'



<P>XI



<P>Having done with the two brothers, the old Devil went to Iv&aacute;n.

He changed himself into a General, and coming to Iv&aacute;n began to

<BR>persuade him that he ought to have an army.



<P>'It does not become a king,' said he, 'to be without an army. Only give

me the order, and I will collect soldiers from among your

<BR>people, and form one.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n listened to him. 'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'form an

army, and teach them to sing songs well. I like to hear them do that.'



<P>So the old Devil went through Ivan's kingdom to enlist men. He told

them to go and be entered as soldiers, and each should have a

<BR>quart of spirits and a fine red cap.



<P>The people laughed.



<P>'We have plenty of spirits,' said they. 'We make it ourselves; and as

for caps, the women make all kinds of them, even striped ones

<BR>with tassels.'



<P>So nobody would enlist.



<P>The old Devil came to Iv&aacute;n and said: 'Your fools won't enlist

of their own free will. We shall have to make them.'



<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'you can try.'



<P>So the old Devil gave notice that all the people were to enlist, and

that Iv&aacute;n would put to death any one who refused.



<P>The people came to the General and said, 'You say that if we do not

go as soldiers the King will put us to death, but you don't say

<BR>what will happen if we do enlist. We have heard say that soldiers get

killed!'



<P>'Yes, that happens sometimes.'



<P>When the people heard this they became obstinate.



<P>'We won't go,' said they. 'Better meet death at home. Either way we

must die.'



<P>'Fools! You are fools!' said the old Devil. 'A soldier may be killed

or he may not, but if you don't go, King Iv&aacute;n will have you killed

<BR>for certain.'



<P>The people were puzzled, and went to Iv&aacute;n the Fool to consult

him.



<P>'A General has come,' said they, 'who says we must all become soldiers.

"If you go as soldiers," says he "you may be killed or you

<BR>may not, but if you don't go, King Iv&aacute;n will certainly kill

you." Is this true?'



<P>Iv&aacute;n laughed and said, 'How can I, alone, put all you to death?

If I were not a fool I would explain it to you but as it is, I don't

<BR>understand it myself.'



<P>'Then' said they, 'we will not serve.'



<P>'All right,' says he, 'don't.'



<P>So the people went to the General and refused to enlist. And the old

Devil saw that this game was up, and he went off and

<BR>ingratiated himself with the King of Tarak&aacute;n.



<P>'Let us make war,' says he, 'and conquer King Iv&aacute;n's country.

It is true there is no money, but there is plenty of corn and cattle

<BR>and everything else.'



<P>So the King of Tarak&aacute;n prepared to make war. He mustered a great

army, provided rifles and cannons, marched to the frontier,

<BR>and entered Iv&aacute;n's kingdom.



<P>And people came to Iv&aacute;n and said, 'The King of Tarak&aacute;n

is coming to make war on us.'



<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'let him come.'



<P>Having crossed the frontier, the King of Tarak&aacute;n sent scouts

to look for Iv&aacute;n's army. They looked and looked, but there was no

<BR>army! They waited and waited for one to appear somewhere, but there

were no signs of an army, and nobody to fight with. The

<BR>King of Tarak&aacute;n then sent to seize the villages. The soldiers

came to a village, and the people, both men and women, rushed out in

<BR>astonishment to stare at the soldiers. The soldiers began to take their

corn and cattle; the people let them have it, and did not resist.

<BR>The soldiers went on to another village; the same thing happened again.

The soldiers went on for one day, and for two days, and

<BR>everywhere the same thing happened. The people let them have everything,

and no one resisted, but only invited the soldiers to live

<BR>with them.



<P>'Poor fellows,' said they, 'if you have a hard life in your own land,

why don't you come and stay with us altogether?'



<P>The soldiers marched and marched: still no army, only people living

and feeding themselves and others, and not resisting, but

<BR>inviting the soldiers to stay and live with them. The soldiers found

it dull work, and they came to the King of Tarak&aacute;n and said, 'We

<BR>cannot fight here, lead us elsewhere. War is all right, but what is

this? It is like cutting pea-soup! We will not make war here any

<BR>more.'



<P>The King of Tarak&aacute;n grew angry, and ordered his soldiers to over-run

the whole kingdom, to destroy the villages, to burn the grain

<BR>and the houses, and to slaughter the cattle. 'And if you do not obey

my orders,' said he, 'I will execute you all.'



<P>The soldiers were frightened, and began to act according to the King's

orders. They began to burn houses and corn, and to kill

<BR>cattle. But the fools still offered no resistance, and only wept. The

old men wept, and the old women wept, and the young people

<BR>wept.



<P>'Why do you harm us?' they said. 'Why do you waste good things? If you

need them, why do you not take them for yourselves?'



<P>At last the soldiers could stand it no longer. They refused to go any

further, and the army disbanded and fled.



<P>XII



<P>The old Devil had to give it up. He could not get the better of Iv&aacute;n

with soldiers. So he changed himself into a fine gentleman, and

<BR>settled down in Ivan's kingdom. He meant to overcome him by means of

money, as he had overcome Tar&aacute;s the Stout.



<P>'I wish,' says he, 'to do you a good turn, to teach you sense and reason.

I will build a house among you and organize a trade.'



<P>'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'come and live among us if you like.'



<P>Next morning the fine gentleman went out into the public square with

a big sack of gold and a sheet of paper, and said, 'You all

<BR>live like swine. I wish to teach you how to live properly. Build me

a house according to this plan. You shall work, I will tell you

<BR>how, and I will pay you with gold coins.' And he showed them the gold.



<P>The fools were astonished; there was no money in use among them; they

bartered their goods, and paid one another with labour.

<BR>They looked at the gold coins with surprise.



<P>'What nice little things they are!' said they.



<P>And they began to exchange their goods and labour for the gentleman's

gold pieces. And the old Devil began, as in Tar&aacute;s's

<BR>kingdom, to be free with his gold, and the people began to exchange

everything for gold and to do all sorts of work for it.



<P>The old Devil was delighted, and thought he to himself, 'Things are

going right this time. Now I shall ruin the Fool as I did Tar&aacute;s,

<BR>and I shall buy him up body and soul.'



<P>But as soon as the fools had provided themselves with gold pieces they

gave them to the women for necklaces. The lasses plaited

<BR>them into their tresses, and at last the children in the street began

to play with the little pieces. Everybody had plenty of them, and

<BR>they stopped taking them. But the fine gentleman's mansion was not

yet half-built, and the grain and cattle for the year were not

<BR>yet provided. So he gave notice that he wished people to come and work

for him, and that he wanted cattle and grain; for each

<BR>thing, and for each service, he was ready to give many more pieces

of gold.



<P>But nobody came to work and nothing was brought. Only sometimes a boy

or a little girl would run up to exchange an egg for a

<BR>gold coin, but nobody else came, and he had nothing to eat. And being

hungry, the fine gentleman went through the village to try

<BR>and buy something for dinner. He tried at one house, and offered a

gold piece for a fowl, but the housewife wouldn't take it.



<P>'I have a lot already,' said she.



<P>He tried at a widow's house to buy a herring, and offered a gold piece.



<P>'I don't want it, my good sir,' said she. 'I have no children to play

with it, and I myself already have three coins as curiosities.'



<P>He tried at a peasant's house to get bread, but neither would the peasant

take money.



<P>'I don't need it,' said he, 'but if you are begging "for Christ's sake[15],"

wait a bit and I'll tell the housewife to cut you a piece of

<BR>bread.'



<P>At that the Devil spat, and ran away. To hear Christ's name mentioned,

let alone receiving anything for Christ's sake, hurt him

<BR>more than sticking a knife into him.



<P>And so he got no bread. Every one had gold, and no matter where the

old Devil went, nobody would give anything for money, but

<BR>every one said, 'Either bring something else, or come and work, or

receive what you want in charity for Christ's sake.'



<P>But the old Devil had nothing but money; for work he had no liking,

and as for taking anything 'for Christ's sake' he could not do

<BR>that. The old Devil grew very angry.



<P>'What more do you want, when I give you money?' said he. 'You can buy

everything with gold, and hire any kind of labourer.' But

<BR>the fools did not heed him.



<P>'No, we do not want money,' said they. 'We have no payments to make,

and no taxes, so what should we do with it?'



<P>The old Devil lay down to sleep -- supperless.



<P>The affair was told to Iv&aacute;n the Fool. People came and asked him,

'What are we to do? A fine gentleman has turned up, who likes

<BR>to eat and drink and dress well, but he does not like to work, does

not beg in "Christ's name," but only offers gold pieces to every

<BR>one. At first people gave him all he wanted until they had plenty of

gold pieces, but now no one gives him anything. What's to be

<BR>done with him? He will die of hunger before long.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n listened.



<P>'All right,' says he, 'we must feed him. Let him live by turn at each

house as a shepherd[16] does.'



<P>There was no help for it. The old Devil had to begin making the round.



<P>In due course the turn came for him to go to Ivan's house. The old Devil

came in to dinner, and the dumb girl was getting it ready.



<P>She had often been deceived by lazy folk who came early to dinner --

without having done their share of work -- and ate up all the

<BR>porridge, so it had occurred to her to find out the sluggards by their

hands. Those who had horny hands, she put at the table, but

<BR>the others got only the scraps that were left over.



<P>The old Devil sat down at the table, but the dumb girl seized him by

the hands and looked at them -- there were no hard places

<BR>there: the hands were clean and smooth, with long nails. The dumb girl

gave a grunt and pulled the Devil away from the table. And

<BR>Iv&aacute;n's wife said to him, 'Don't be offended, fine gentleman.

My sister-in-law does not allow any one to come to table who hasn't

<BR>horny hands. But wait awhile, after the folk have eaten you shall have

what is left.'



<P>The old Devil was offended that in the King's house they wished him

to feed like a pig. He said to Iv&aacute;n, 'It is a foolish law you

<BR>have in your kingdom that every one must work with his hands. It's

your stupidity that invented it. Do people work only with their

<BR>hands? What do you think wise men work with?'



<P>And Iv&aacute;n said, 'How are we fools to know? We do most of our work

with our hands and our backs.'



<P>'That is because you are fools! But I will teach you how to work with

the head. Then you will know that it is more profitable to

<BR>work with the head than with the hands.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n was surprised.



<P>'If that is so' said he, 'then there is some sense in calling us fools!'



<P>And the old Devil went on. 'Only it is not easy to work with one's head.

You give me nothing to eat, because I have no hard

<BR>places on my hands, but you do not know that it is a hundred times

more difficult to work with the head. Sometimes one's head

<BR>quite splits.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n became thoughtful.



<P>'Why, then, friend, do you torture yourself so? Is it pleasant when

the head splits? Would it not be better to do easier work with

<BR>your hands and your back?'



<P>But the Devil said, 'I do it all out of pity for you fools. If I didn't

torture myself you would remain fools for ever. But, having

<BR>worked with my head, I can now teach you.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n was surprised.



<P>'Do teach us!' said he, 'so that when our hands get cramped we may use

our heads for a change.'



<P>And the Devil promised to teach the people. So Iv&aacute;n gave notice

throughout the kingdom that a fine gentleman had come who

<BR>would teach everybody how to work with their heads; that with the head

more could be done than with the hands; and that the

<BR>people ought all to come and learn.



<P>Now there was in Ivan's kingdom a high tower, with many steps leading

up to a lantern on the top. And Iv&aacute;n took the gentleman

<BR>up there that every one might see him.



<P>So the gentleman took his place on the top of the tower and began to

speak, and the people came together to see him. They

<BR>thought the gentleman would really show them how to work with the head

without using the hands. But the old Devil only taught

<BR>them in many words how they might live without working. The people

could make nothing of it. They looked and considered, and

<BR>at last went off to attend to their affairs.



<P>The old Devil stood on the tower a whole day, and after that a second

day, talking all the time. But standing there so long he grew

<BR>hungry, and the fools never thought of taking food to him up in the

tower. They thought that if he could work with his head better

<BR>than with his hands, he could at any rate easily provide himself with

bread.



<P>The old Devil stood on the top of the tower yet another day, talking

away. People came near, looked on for awhile, and then went

<BR>away.



<P>And Iv&aacute;n asked, 'Well, has the gentleman begun to work with his

head yet?'



<P>'Not yet,' said the people; 'he's still spouting away.'



<P>The old Devil stood on the tower one day more, but he began to grow

weak, so that he staggered and hit his head against one of

<BR>the pillars of the lantern. One of the people noticed it and told Ivan's

wife, and she ran to her husband, who was in the field.



<P>'Come and look,' said she. 'They say the gentleman is beginning to work

with his head.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n was surprised.



<P>'Really?' says he, and he turned his horse round, and went to the tower.

And by the time he reached the tower the old Devil was

<BR>quite exhausted with hunger, and was staggering and knocking his head

against the pillars. And just as Iv&aacute;n arrived at the tower,

<BR>the Devil stumbled, fell, and came bump, bump, bump, straight down

the stairs to the bottom, counting each step with a knock of

<BR>his head!



<P>'Well!' says Iv&aacute;n, 'the fine gentleman told the truth when he

said that "sometimes one's head quite splits." This is worse than

<BR>blisters; after such work there will be swellings on the head.'



<P>The old Devil tumbled out at the foot of the stairs, and struck his

head against the ground. Iv&aacute;n was about to go up to him to see

<BR>how much work he had done -- when suddenly the earth opened and the

old Devil fell through. Only a hole was left.



<P>Iv&aacute;n scratched his head.



<P>'What a nasty thing,' says he. 'It's one of those devils again! What

a whopper! He must be the father of them all.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n is still living, and people crowd to his kingdom. His own

brothers have come to live with him, and he feeds them, too. To

<BR>every one who comes and says 'Give me food!' Iv&aacute;n says, 'All

right. You can stay with us; we have plenty of everything.'



<P>Only there is one special custom in his kingdom; whoever has horny hands

comes to table, but whoever has not, must eat what the

<BR>others leave.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>THE IMP AND THE CRUST</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>A POOR peasant set out early one morning to plough, taking with him

for his breakfast a crust of bread. He got his plough ready,

<BR>wrapped the bread in his coat, put it under a bush, and set to work.

After a while when his horse was tired and he was hungry, the

<BR>peasant fixed the plough, let the horse loose to graze and went to

get his coat and his breakfast



<P>He lifted the coat, but the bread was gone! He looked and looked, turned

the coat over, shook it out -- but the bread was gone.

<BR>The peasant could not make this out at all.



<P>'That's strange,' thought he; 'I saw no one, but all the same some one

has been here and has taken the bread!'



<P>It was an imp who had stolen the bread while the peasant was ploughing,

and at that moment he was sitting behind the bush,

<BR>waiting to hear the peasant swear and call on the Devil.



<P>The peasant was sorry to lose his breakfast, but 'It can't be helped,'

said he. 'After all, I shan't die of hunger! No doubt whoever

<BR>took the bread needed it. May it do him good!'



<P>And he went to the well, had a drink of water, and rested a bit. Then

he caught his horse, harnessed it, and began ploughing again.



<P>The imp was crestfallen at not having made the peasant sin, and he went

to report what had happened to the Devil, his master.



<P>He came to the Devil and told how he had taken the peasant's bread,

and how the peasant instead of cursing had said, 'May it do

<BR>him good!'



<P>The Devil was angry, and replied: 'If the man got the better of you,

it was your own fault -- you don't understand your business! If

<BR>the peasants, and their wives after them, take to that sort of thing,

it will be all up with us. The matter can't be left like that! Go

<BR>back at once,' said he, 'and put things right. If in three years you

don't get the better of that peasant, I'll have you ducked in holy

<BR>water!'



<P>The imp was frightened. He scampered back to earth, thinking how he

could redeem his fault. He thought and thought, and at last

<BR>hit upon a good plan.



<P>He turned himself into a labouring man, and went and took service with

the poor peasant. The first year he advised the peasant to

<BR>sow corn in a marshy place. The peasant took his advice, and sowed

in the marsh. The year turned out a very dry one, and the

<BR>crops of the other peasants were all scorched by the sun, but the poor

peasant's corn grew thick and tall and full-eared. Not only

<BR>had he grain enough to last him for the whole year, but he had much

left over besides.



<P>The next year the imp advised the peasant to sow on the hill; and it

turned out a wet summer. Other people's corn was beaten

<BR>down and rotted and the ears did not fill; but the peasant's crop,

up on the hill, was a fine one. He had more grain left over than

<BR>before, so that he did not know what to do with it all.



<P>Then the imp showed the peasant how he could mash the grain and distil

spirit from it; and the peasant made strong drink, and

<BR>began to drink it himself and to give it to his friends.



<P>So the imp went to the Devil, his master, and boasted that he had made

up for his failure. The Devil said that he would come and

<BR>see for himself how the case stood.



<P>He came to the peasant's house, and saw that the peasant had invited

his well-to-do neighbours and was treating them to drink.

<BR>His wife was offering the drink to the guests, and as she handed it

round she tumbled against the table and spilt a glassful.



<P>The peasant was angry, and scolded his wife: 'What do you mean, you

slut? Do you think it's ditchwater, you cripple, that you

<BR>must go pouring good stuff like that over the floor?'



<P>The imp nudged the Devil, his master, with his elbow: 'See,' said he,

'that's the man who did not grudge his last crust!'



<P>The peasant, still railing at his wife, began to carry the drink round

himself. Just then a poor peasant returning from work came in

<BR>uninvited. He greeted the company, sat down, and saw that they were

drinking. Tired with his day's work he felt that he too would

<BR>like a drop. He sat and sat, and his mouth kept watering, but the host

instead of offering him any only muttered: 'I can't find drink

<BR>for every one who comes along.'



<P>This pleased the Devil; but the imp chuckled and said, 'Wait a bit,

there's more to come yet!'



<P>The rich peasants drank, and their host drank too. And they began to

make false, oily speeches to one another.



<P>The Devil listened and listened, and praised the imp.



<P>'If,' said he, 'the drink makes them so foxy that they begin to cheat

each other, they will soon all be in our hands.'



<P>'Wait for what's coming,' said the imp. 'Let them have another glass

all round. Now they are like foxes, wagging their tails and

<BR>trying to get round one another; but presently you will see them like

savage wolves.'



<P>The peasants had another glass each, and their talk became wilder and

rougher. Instead of oily speeches they began to abuse and

<BR>snarl at one another. Soon they took to fighting, and punched one another's

noses. And the host joined in the fight, and he too got

<BR>well beaten.



<P>The Devil looked on and was much pleased at all this. 'This is first-rate!'

said he.



<P>But the imp replied: 'Wait a bit -- the best is yet to come. Wait till

they have had a third glass. Now they are raging like wolves, but

<BR>let them have one more glass, and they will be like swine.'



<P>The peasants had their third glass, and became quite like brutes. They

muttered and shouted, not knowing why, and not listening to

<BR>one another.



<P>Then the party began to break up. Some went alone, some in twos, and

some in threes, all staggering down the street. The host

<BR>went out to speed his guests, but he fell on his nose into a puddle,

smeared himself from top to toe, and lay there grunting like a

<BR>hog.



<P>This pleased the Devil still more.



<P>'Well,' said he, 'you have hit on a first-rate drink, and have quite

made up for your blunder about the bread. But now tell me how

<BR>this drink is made. You must first have put in fox's blood: that was

what made the peasants sly as foxes. Then, I suppose, you

<BR>added wolf's blood: that is what made them fierce like wolves. And

you must have finished off with swine's blood, to make them

<BR>behave like swine.'



<P>'No,' said the imp, 'that was not the way I did it. All I did was to

see that the peasant had more corn than he needed. The blood of

<BR>the beasts is always in man; but as long as he has only enough corn

for his needs, it is kept in bounds. While that was the case, the

<BR>peasant did not grudge his last crust. But when he had corn left over,

he looked for ways of getting pleasure out of it. And I

<BR>showed him a pleasure -- drinking! And when he began to turn God's

good gifts into spirits for his own pleasure -- the fox's, wolf's

<BR>and swine's blood in him all came out. If only he goes on drinking,

he will always be a beast!'



<P>The Devil praised the imp, forgave him for his former blunder, and advanced

him to a post of high honour.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>THE BEAR-HUNT</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>[The adventure here narrated is one that happened to Tolstoy himself

in 1858. More than twenty years later he gave up hunting,

<BR>on humanitarian grounds.]



<P>WE were out on a bear-hunting expedition. My comrade had shot at a bear,

but only gave him a flesh-wound. There were

<BR>traces of blood on the snow, but the bear had got away.



<P>We all collected in a group in the forest, to decide whether we ought

to go after the bear at once, or wait two or three days till

<BR>he should settle down again. We asked the peasant bear-drivers whether

it would be possible to get round the bear that day.



<P>'No. It's impossible,' said an old bear-driver. 'You must let the bear

quiet down. In five days' time it will be possible to surround

<BR>him; but if you followed him now, you would only frighten him away,

and he would not settle down.'



<P>But a young bear-driver began disputing with the old man, saying that

it was quite possible to get round the bear now.



<P>'On such snow as this,' said he, 'he won't go far, for he is a fat bear.

He will settle down before evening; or, if not, I can

<BR>overtake him on snowshoes.'



<P>The comrade I was with was against following up the bear, and advised

waiting. But I said:



<P>'We need not argue. You do as you like, but I will follow up the track

with Damian. If we get round the bear, all right. If not,

<BR>we lose nothing. It is still early, and there is nothing else for us

to do to-day.'



<P>So it was arranged.



<P>The others went back to the sledges, and returned to the village. Damian

and I took some bread, and remained behind in the

<BR>forest.



<P>When they had all left us, Damian and I examined our guns, and after

tucking the skirts of our warm coats into our belts, we

<BR>started off, following the bear's tracks.



<P>The weather was fine, frosty and calm; but it was hard work snow-shoeing.

The snow was deep and soft: it had not caked

<BR>together at all in the forest, and fresh snow had fallen the day before,

so that our snow-shoes sank six inches deep in the snow,

<BR>and sometimes more.



<P>The bear's tracks were visible from a distance, and we could see how

he had been going; sometimes sinking in up to his belly

<BR>and ploughing up the snow as he went. At first, while under large trees,

we kept in sight of his track; but when it turned into a

<BR>thicket of small firs, Damian stopped.



<P>'We must leave the trail now,' said he. 'He has probably settled somewhere

here. You can see by the snow that he has been

<BR>squatting down. Let us leave the track and go round; but we must go

quietly. Don't shout or cough, or we shall frighten him

<BR>away.'



<P>Leaving the track, therefore, we turned off to the left. But when we

had gone about five hundred yards, there were the bear's

<BR>traces again right before us. We followed them, and they brought us

out on to the road. There we stopped, examining the road

<BR>to see which way the bear had gone. Here and there in the snow were

prints of the bear's paw, claws and all, and here and

<BR>there the marks of a peasant's bark shoes. The bear had evidently gone

towards the village.



<P>As we followed the road, Damian said:



<P>'It's no use watching the road now. We shall see where he has turned

off, to right or left, by the marks in the soft snow at the

<BR>side. He must have turned off somewhere; for he won't have gone on

to the village.'



<P>We went along the road for nearly a mile, and then saw, ahead of us,

the bear's track turning off the road. We examined it.

<BR>How strange! It was a bear's track right enough, only not going from

the road into the forest, but from the forest on to the road!

<BR>The toes were pointing towards the road.



<P>'This must be another bear,' I said.



<P>Damian looked at it, and considered a while.



<P>'No,' said he. 'It's the same one. He's been playing tricks, and walked

backwards when he left the road.'



<P>We followed the track, and found it really was so! The bear had gone

some ten steps backwards, and then, behind a fir tree,

<BR>had turned round and gone straight ahead. Damian stopped and said:



<P>'Now, we are sure to get round him. There is a marsh ahead of us, and

he must have settled down there. Let us go round it.'



<P>We began to make our way round, through a fir thicket. I was tired out

by this time, and it had become still more difficult to get

<BR>along. Now I glided on to juniper bushes and caught my snow-shoes in

them, now a tiny fir tree appeared between my feet, or,

<BR>from want of practise, my snow-shoes slipped off; and now I came upon

a stump or a log hidden by the snow. I was getting

<BR>very tired, and was drenched with perspiration; and I took off my fur

cloak. And there was Damian all the time, gliding along as

<BR>if in a boat, his snowshoes moving as if of their own accord, never

catching against anything, nor slipping off. He even took my

<BR>fur and slung it over his shoulder, and still kept urging me on.



<P>We went on for two more miles, and came out on the other side of the

marsh. I was lagging behind. My snow-shoes kept

<BR>slipping off, and my feet stumbled. Suddenly Damian, who was ahead

of me, stopped and waved his arm. When I came up to

<BR>him, he bent down, pointing with his hand, and whispered:



<P>'Do you see the magpie chattering above that undergrowth? It scents

the bear from afar. That is where he must be.'



<P>We turned off and went on for more than another half-mile, and presently

we came on to the old track again. We had,

<BR>therefore, been right round the bear who was now within the track we

had left. We stopped, and I took off my cap and

<BR>loosened all my clothes. I was as hot as in a steam bath, and as wet

as a drowned rat. Damian too was flushed, and wiped his

<BR>face with his sleeve.



<P>'Well, sir,' he said, 'we have done our job, and now we must have a

rest.'



<P>The evening glow already showed red through the forest. We took off

our snow-shoes and sat down on them, and got some

<BR>bread and salt out of our bags. First I ate some snow, and then some

bread; and the bread tasted so good, that I thought I had

<BR>never in my life had any like it before. We sat there resting until

it began to grow dusk, and then I asked Damian if it was far to

<BR>the village.



<P>'Yes,' he said. 'It must be about eight miles. We will go on there to-night,

but now we must rest. Put on your fur coat, sir, or

<BR>you'll be catching cold.'



<P>Damian flattened down the snow, and breaking off some fir branches made

a bed of them. We lay down side by side, resting

<BR>our heads on our arms. I do not remember how I fell asleep. Two hours

later I woke up, hearing something crack.



<P>I had slept so soundly that I did not know where I was. I looked around

me. How wonderful! I was in some sort of a hall, all

<BR>glittering and white with gleaming pillars, and when I looked up I

saw, through delicate white tracery, a vault, raven black and

<BR>studded with coloured lights. After a good look, I remembered that

we were in the forest, and that what I took for a hall and

<BR>pillars, were trees covered with snow and hoar-frost, and the coloured

lights were stars twinkling between the branches.



<P>Hoar-frost had settled in the night; all the twigs were thick with it,

Damian was covered with it, it was on my fur coat, and it

<BR>dropped down from the trees. I woke Damian, and we put on our snowshoes

and started. It was very quiet in the forest. No

<BR>sound was heard but that of our snow-shoes pushing through the soft

snow; except when now and then a tree, cracked by the

<BR>frost, made the forest resound. Only once we heard the sound of a living

creature. Something rustled close to us, and then

<BR>rushed away. I felt sure it was the bear, but when we went to the spot

whence the sound had come, we found the footmarks of

<BR>hares, and saw several young aspen trees with their bark gnawed. We

had startled some hares while they were feeding.



<P>We came out on the road, and followed it, dragging our snow-shoes behind

us. It was easy walking now. Our snow-shoes

<BR>clattered as they slid behind us from side to side of the hard-trodden

road. The snow creaked under our boots, and the cold

<BR>hoar-frost settled on our faces like down. Seen through the branches,

the stars seemed to be running to meet us, now twinkling,

<BR>now vanishing, as if the whole sky were on the move.



<P>I found my comrade sleeping, but woke him up, and related how we had

got round the bear. After telling our peasant host to

<BR>collect beaters for the morning, we had supper and lay down to sleep.



<P>I was so tired that I could have slept on till midday, if my comrade

had not roused me. I jumped up, and saw that he was

<BR>already dressed, and busy doing something to his gun.



<P>'Where is Damian?' said I.



<P>'In the forest, long ago. He has already been over the tracks you made,

and been back here, and now he has gone to look after

<BR>the beaters.'



<P>I washed and dressed, and loaded my guns; and then we got into a sledge,

and started.



<P>The sharp frost still continued. It was quiet, and the sun could not

be seen. There was a thick mist above us, and hoar-frost still

<BR>covered everything.



<P>After driving about two miles along the road, as we came near the forest,

we saw a cloud of smoke rising from a hollow, and

<BR>presently reached a group of peasants, both men and women, armed with

cudgels.



<P>We got out and went up to them. The men sat roasting potatoes, and laughing

and talking with the women.



<P>Damian was there too; and when we arrived the people got up, and Damian

led them away to place them in the circle we had

<BR>made the day before. They went along in single file, men and women,

thirty in all. The snow was so deep that we could only see

<BR>them from their waists upwards. They turned into the forest, and my

friend and I followed in their track.



<P>Though they had trodden a path, walking was difficult, but, on the other

hand, it was impossible to fall: it was like walking

<BR>between two walls of snow.



<P>We went on in this way for nearly half a mile, when all at once we saw

Damian coming from another direction -- running

<BR>towards us on his snowshoes, and beckoning us to join him. We went

towards him, and he showed us where to stand. I took

<BR>my place, and looked round me.



<P>To my left were tall fir trees, between the trunks of which I could

see a good way, and, like a black patch just visible behind the

<BR>trees, I could see a beater. In front of me was a thicket of young

firs, about as high as a man, their branches weighed down and

<BR>stuck together with snow. Through this copse ran a path thickly covered

with snow, and leading straight up to where I stood.

<BR>The thicket stretched away to the right of me, and ended in a small

glade, where I could see Damian placing my comrade.



<P>I examined both my guns, and considered where I had better stand. Three

steps behind me was a tall fir.



<P>'That's where I'll stand,' thought I, 'and then I can lean my second

gun against the tree'; and I moved towards the tree, sinking

<BR>up to my knees in the snow at each step. I trod the snow down, and

made a clearance about a yard square, to stand on. One

<BR>gun I kept in my hand; the other, ready cocked, I placed leaning up

against the tree. Then I unsheathed and replaced my

<BR>dagger, to make sure that I could draw it easily in case of need.



<P>Just as I had finished these preparations, I heard Damian shouting in

the forest:



<P>'He's up! He's up!'



<P>And as soon as Damian shouted, the peasants round the circle all replied

in their different voices.



<P>'Up, up, up! Ou! Ou! Ou!' shouted the men.



<P>'Ay! Ay! Ay!' screamed the women in high. pitched tones.



<P>The bear was inside the circle, and as Damian drove him on, the people

all round kept shouting. Only my friend and I stood

<BR>silent and motionless, waiting for the bear to come towards us. As

I stood gazing and listening, my heart beat violently. I

<BR>trembled, holding my gun fast.



<P>'Now now,' I thought. 'He will come suddenly. I shall aim, fire, and

he will drop -- '



<P>Suddenly, to my left, but at a distance, I heard something falling on

the snow. I looked between the tall fir trees, and, some fifty

<BR>paces off, behind the trunks, saw something big and black. I took aim

and waited, thinking:



<P>'Won't he come any nearer?'



<P>As I waited I saw him move his ears, turn, and go back; and then I caught

a glimpse of the whole of him in profile. He was an

<BR>immense brute. In my excitement, I fired, and heard my bullet go 'flop'

against a tree. Peering through the smoke, I saw my bear

<BR>scampering back into the circle, and disappearing among the trees.



<P>'Well,' thought I. 'My chance is lost. He won't come back to me. Either

my comrade will shoot him, or he will escape through

<BR>the line of beaters. In any case he won't give me another chance.'



<P>I reloaded my gun, however, and again stood listening. The peasants

were shouting all round, but to the right, not far from

<BR>where my comrade stood, I heard a woman screaming in a frenzied voice:

'Here he is! Here he is! Come here, come here! Oh!

<BR>Oh! Ay! Ay!'



<P>Evidently she could see the bear. I had given up expecting him, and

was looking to the right at my comrade. All at once I saw

<BR>Damian with a stick in his hand, and without his snow-shoes, running

along a footpath towards my friend. He crouched down

<BR>beside him, pointing his stick as if aiming at something, and then

I saw my friend raise his gun and aim in the same direction.

<BR>Crack! He fired.



<P>'There,' thought I. 'He has killed him.'



<P>But I saw that my comrade did not run towards the bear. Evidently he

had missed him, or the shot had not taken full effect.



<P>'The bear will get away,' I thought. 'He will go back, but he won't

come a second time towards me. -- But what is that?'



<P>Something was coming towards me like a whirlwind, snorting as it came;

and I saw the snow flying up quite near me. I glanced

<BR>straight before me, and there was the bear, rushing along the path

through the thicket right at me, evidently beside himself with

<BR>fear. He was hardly half a dozen paces off, and I could see the whole

of him -- his black chest and enormous head with a

<BR>reddish patch. There he was, blundering straight at me, and scattering

the snow about as he came. I could see by his eyes that

<BR>he did not see me, but, mad with fear, was rushing blindly along; and

his path led him straight at the tree under which I was

<BR>standing. I raised my gun and fired. He was almost upon me now, and

I saw that I had missed. My bullet had gone past him,

<BR>and he did not even hear me fire, but still came headlong towards me.

I lowered my gun, and fired again, almost touching his

<BR>head. Crack! I had hit, but not killed him!



<P>He raised his head, and laying his ears back, came at me, showing his

teeth.



<P>I snatched at my other gun, but almost before I had touched it, he had

down at me and, knocking me over into the snow, had

<BR>passed right over me.



<P>'Thank goodness, he has left me,' thought I.



<P>I tried to rise, but something pressed me down, and prevented my getting

up. The bear's rush had carried him past me, but he

<BR>had turned back, and had fallen on me with the whole weight of his

body. I felt something heavy weighing me down, and

<BR>something warm above my face, and I realized that he was drawing my

whole face into his mouth. My nose was already in it,

<BR>and I felt the heat of it, and smelt his blood. He was pressing my

shoulders down with his paws so that I could not move: all I

<BR>could do was to draw my head down towards my chest away from his mouth,

trying to free my nose and eyes, while he tried to

<BR>get his teeth into them. Then I felt that he had seized my forehead

just under the hair with the teeth of his lower jaw, and the

<BR>flesh below my eyes with his upper jaw, and was closing his teeth.

It was as if my face were being cut with knives. I struggled

<BR>to get away, while he made haste to close his jaws like a dog gnawing.

I managed to twist my face away, but he began drawing

<BR>it again into his mouth.



<P>'Now,' thought I, 'my end has come!'



<P>Then I felt the weight lifted, and looking up, I saw that he was no

longer there. He had jumped off me and run away.



<P>When my comrade and Damian had seen the bear knock me down and begin

worrying me, they rushed to the rescue. My

<BR>comrade, in his haste, blundered, and instead of following the trodden

path, ran into the deep snow and fell down. While he

<BR>was struggling out of the snow, the bear was gnawing at me. But Damian

just as he was, without a gun, and with only a stick in

<BR>his hand, rushed along the path shouting:



<P>'He's eating the master! He's eating the master!'



<P>And as he ran, he called to the bear:



<P>'Oh you idiot! What are you doing? Leave off! Leave off!'



<P>The bear obeyed him, and leaving me ran away. When I rose, there was

as much blood on the snow as if a sheep had been

<BR>killed, and the flesh hung in rags above my eyes, though in my excitement

I felt no pain.



<P>My comrade had come up by this time, and the other people collected

round: they looked at my wound, and put snow on it.

<BR>But I, forgetting about my wounds, only asked:



<P>'Where's the bear? Which way has he gone?'



<P>Suddenly I heard:



<P>'Here he is! Here he is!'



<P>And we saw the bear again running at us. We seized our guns, but before

any one had time to fire he had run past. He had

<BR>grown ferocious, and wanted to gnaw me again, but seeing so many people

he took fright. We saw by his track that his head

<BR>was bleeding and we wanted to follow him up; but, as my wounds had

become very painful, we went, instead, to the town to

<BR>find a doctor.



<P>The doctor stitched up my wounds with silk, and they soon began to heal.



<P>A month later we went to hunt that bear again, but I did not get a chance

of finishing him. He would not come out of the circle,

<BR>but went round and round growling in a terrible voice.



<P>Damian killed him. The bear's lower jaw had been broken, and one of

his teeth knocked out by my bullet.



<P>He was a huge creature, and had splendid black fur.



<P>I had him stuffed, and he now lies in my room. The wounds on my forehead

healed up so that the scars can scarcely be seen.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THIS volume is divided into seven parts.



<P>First we have Tales for Children, published about the year 1872, and

reminding us of the time when Tolstoy was absorbed in

<BR>efforts to educate the peasant children. This section of the book contains

the two stories which of all that he has written Tolstoy

<BR>likes best. In What is Art? he claims no place among examples of good

art for any of his own productions 'except for the story

<BR>God sees the Truth, but Waits, which seeks a place in the first class

(religious art), and A Prisoner in the Caucasus, which

<BR>belongs to the second (universal art).' In the first of these the subject

(a favourite one with Tolstoy) is the forgiveness of injuries.

<BR>The second deals with the simplest feelings common to all men: fear

and courage, pity, endurance, &amp;c.' expressed with that

<BR>individuality, clearness, and sincerity, which Tolstoy says are the

signs of true art.



<P>Part II contains a series of stories written for the people; and among

them What Men Live By, probably the most widely

<BR>circulated of all Tolstoy's tales. It is founded on the oft-repeated

legend of an angel sent by God to live for a while among men.



<P>Part III consists of a Fairy Tale, Iv&aacute;n the Fool, which contains

in popular form Tolstoy's indictment of militarism and

<BR>commercialism.



<P>Part IV contains three short stories written to help the sale of cheap

reproductions of some good drawings; Tolstoy having for

<BR>many years been anxious by all means in his power to further the circulation,

at a cheap price, of good works of pictorial as

<BR>well as literary art.



<P>In Part V we have a series of Russian Folk-Tales. The gems of this collection

are the temperance story, The Imp and the

<BR>Crust, the anti-war story, The Empty Drum, and another story, How Much

Land does a Man Need? which deals with a

<BR>peasant's greed for land. A Grain as big as a Hen's Egg and The Godson

are highly characteristic of the spirit of the Russian

<BR>peasantry, and supply a glimpse of the sources from whence Tolstoy

imbibed many of his own spiritual sympathies and

<BR>antipathies.



<P>Part VI gives two adaptations from the French which have appeared in

no previous English edition of Tolstoy's works. They

<BR>are not merely translations, for to some extent Tolstoy when translating

them, modified them and made them his own.



<P>Part VII consists of stories Tolstoy contributed in aid of the Jews

left destitute after the massacres and outrages in Kishin&eacute;f and

<BR>elsewhere in Russia in 1903, -- outrages which were forerunners of

the yet more terrible Jewish massacres of 1905.



<P>The importance Tolstoy attributes to literature of the kind contained

in this volume, is shown by the following passage in What is

<BR>Art? --



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The artist of the future will understand that

to compose a fairy tale, a little song which will touch a lullaby

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a riddle which will entertain, a jest which

will amuse, or to draw a sketch such as will delight dozens of

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generations or millions of children and adults,

is incomparably more important and more fruitful than to

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compose a novel, or a symphony, or paint a

picture, of the kind which diverts some members of the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wealthy classes for a short time and is then

for ever forgotten. The region of this art of the simplest

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feelings accessible to all is enormous, and

it is as yet almost untouched.'



<P>The sections of the book have been arranged in chronological order.

The date when each story was published is given. The

<BR>translations are new ones, and for the footnotes I am responsible.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>ESARHADDON, KING OF ASSYRIA</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE Assyrian King, Esarhaddon, had conquered the kingdom of King Lailie,

had destroyed and burnt the towns, taken all the

<BR>inhabitants captive to his own country, slaughtered the warriors, beheaded

some chieftains and impaled or flayed others, and had

<BR>confined King Lailie himself in a cage.



<P>As he lay on his bed one night, King Esarhaddon was thinking how he

should execute Lailie, when suddenly he heard a rustling

<BR>near his bed, and opening his eyes saw an old man with a long grey

bead and mild eyes.



<P>'You wish to execute Lailie?' asked the old man.



<P>'Yes,' answered the King. 'But I cannot make up my mind how to do it.'



<P>'But you are Lailie,' said the old man.



<P>'That's not true,' replied the King. 'Lailie is Lailie, and I am I.'



<P>'You and Lailie are one,' said the old man. 'You only imagine you are

not Lailie, and that Lailie is not you.'



<P>'What do you mean by that?' said the King. 'Here am I, lying on a soft

bed; around me are obedient men-slaves and

<BR>women-slaves, and to-morrow I shall feast with my friends as I did

to-day; whereas Lailie is sitting like a bird in a cage, and

<BR>to-morrow he will be impaled, and with his tongue hanging out will

struggle till he dies, and his body will be torn in pieces by dogs.'



<P>'You cannot destroy his life,' said the old man.



<P>'And how about the fourteen thousand warriors I killed, with whose bodies

I built a mound?' said the King. 'I am alive, but they no

<BR>longer exist. Does not that prove that I can destroy life?'



<P>'How do you know they no longer exist?'



<P>'Because I no longer see them. And, above all, they were tormented,

but I was not. It was ill for them, but well for me.'



<P>'That, also, only seems so to you. You tortured yourself, but not them.'



<P>'I do not understand,' said the King.



<P>'Do you wish to understand?'



<P>'Yes, I do.'



<P>'Then come here,' said the old man, pointing to a large font full of

water.



<P>The King rose and approached the font.



<P>'Strip, and enter the font.'



<P>Esarhaddon did as the old man bade him.



<P>'As soon as I begin to pour this water over you,' said the old man,

filling a pitcher with the water, 'dip down your head.'



<P>The old man tilted the pitcher over the King's head and the King bent

his head till it was under water.



<P>And as soon as King Esarhaddon was under the water he felt that he was

no longer Esarhaddon, but some one else. And, feeling

<BR>himself to be that other man, he saw himself lying on a rich bed, beside

a beautiful woman. He had never seen her before, but he

<BR>knew she was his wife. The woman raised herself and said to him:



<P>'Dear husband, Lailie! You were wearied by yesterday's work and have

slept longer than usual, and I have guarded your rest, and

<BR>have not roused you. But now the Princes await you in the Great Hall.

Dress and go out to them.'



<P>And Esarhaddon -- understanding from these words that he was Lailie,

and not feeling at all surprised at this, but only wondering

<BR>that he did not know it before -- rose, dressed, and went into the

Great Hall where the Princes awaited him.



<P>The Princes greeted Lailie, their King, bowing to the ground, and then

they rose, and at his word sat down before him; and the

<BR>eldest of the Princes began to speak, saying that it was impossible

longer to endure the insults of the wicked King Esarhaddon, and

<BR>that they must make war on him. But Lailie disagreed, and gave orders

that envoys shall be sent to remonstrate with King

<BR>Esarhaddon; and he dismissed the Princes from the audience. Afterwards

he appointed men of note to act as ambassadors, and

<BR>impressed on them what they were to say to King Esarhaddon. Having

finished this business, Esarhaddon -- feeling himself to be

<BR>Lailie -- rode out to hunt wild asses. The hunt was successful. He

killed two wild asses himself, and having returned home, feasted

<BR>with his friends, and witnessed a dance of slave girls. The next day

he went to the Court, where he was awaited by petitioners

<BR>suitors, and prisoners brought for trial; and there as usual he decided

the cases submitted to him. Having finished this business, he

<BR>again rode out to his favourite amusement: the hunt. And again he was

successful: this time killing with his own hand an old

<BR>lioness, and capturing her two cubs. After the hunt he again feasted

with his friends, and was entertained with music and dances,

<BR>and the night he spent with the wife whom he loved.



<P>So, dividing his time between kingly duties and pleasures, he lived

for days and weeks, awaiting the return of the ambassadors he

<BR>had sent to that King Esarhaddon who used to be himself. Not till a

month had passed did the ambassadors return, and they

<BR>returned with their noses and ears cut off.



<P>King Esarhaddon had ordered them to tell Lailie that what had been done

to them -- the ambassadors -- would be done to King

<BR>Lailie himself also, unless he sent immediately a tribute of silver,

gold, and cypress-wood, and came himself to pay homage to King

<BR>Esarhaddon.



<P>Lailie, formerly Esarhaddon, again assembled the Princes, and took counsel

with them as to what he should do. They all with one

<BR>accord said that war must be made against Esarhaddon, without waiting

for him to attack them. The King agreed; and taking his

<BR>place at the head of the army, started on the campaign. The campaign

lasts seven days. Each day the King rode round the army to

<BR>rouse the courage of his warriors. On the eighth day his army met that

of Esarhaddon in a broad valley through which a river

<BR>flowed. Lailie's army fought bravely, but Lailie, formerly Esarhaddon,

saw the enemy swarming down from the mountains like

<BR>ants, over-running the valley and overwhelming his army; and, in his

chariot, he flung himself into the midst of the battle, hewing

<BR>and felling the enemy. But the warriors of Lailie were but as hundreds,

while those of Esarhaddon were as thousands; and Lailie

<BR>felt himself wounded and taken prisoner. Nine days he journeyed with

other captives, bound, and guarded by the warriors of

<BR>Esarhaddon. On the tenth day he reached Nineveh, and was placed in

a cage. Lailie suffered not so much from hunger and from

<BR>his wound as from shame and impotent rage. He felt how powerless he

was to avenge himself on his enemy for all he was

<BR>suffering. All he could do was to deprive his enemies of the pleasure

of seeing his sufferings; and he firmly resolved to endure

<BR>courageously without a murmur, all they could do to him. For twenty

days he sat in his cage, awaiting execution. He saw his

<BR>relatives and friends led out to death; he heard the groans of those

who were executed: some had their hands and feet cut off,

<BR>others were flayed alive, but he showed neither disquietude, nor pity,

nor fear. He saw the wife he loved, bound, and led by two

<BR>black eunuchs. He knew she was being taken as a slave to Esarhaddon.

That, too, he bore without a murmur. But one of the

<BR>guards placed to watch him said, 'I pity you, Lailie; you were a king,

but what are you now?' And hearing these words, Lailie

<BR>remembered all he had lost. He clutched the bars of his cage, and,

wishing to kill himself, beat his head against them. But he had

<BR>not the strength to do so and, groaning in despair, he fell upon the

floor of his cage.



<P>At last two executioners opened his cage door, and having strapped his

arms tight behind him, led him to the place of execution,

<BR>which was soaked with blood. Lailie saw a sharp stake dripping with

blood, from which the corpse of one of his friends had just

<BR>been torn, and he understood that this had been done that the stake

might serve for his own execution. They stripped Lailie of his

<BR>clothes. He was startled at the leanness of his once strong, handsome

body. The two executioners seized that body by its lean

<BR>thighs; they lifted him up and were about to let him fall upon the

stake.



<P>'This is death, destruction!' thought Lailie, and, forgetful of his

resolve to remain bravely calm to the end, he sobbed and prayed for

<BR>mercy. But no one listened to him.



<P>'But this cannot be,' thought he. 'Surely I am asleep. It is a dream.'

And he made an effort to rouse himself, and did indeed awake,

<BR>to find himself neither Esarhaddon nor Lailie -- but some kind of an

animal. He was astonished that he was an animal, and

<BR>astonished, also, at not having known this before.



<P>He was grazing in a valley, tearing the tender grass with his teeth,

and brushing away flies with his long tail. Around him was

<BR>frolicking a long-legged, dark-gray ass-colt, striped down its back.

Kicking up its hind legs, the colt galloped full speed to

<BR>Esarhaddon, and poking him under the stomach with its smooth little

muzzle, searched for the teat, and, finding it, quieted down,

<BR>swallowing regularly. Esarhaddon understood that he was a she-ass,

the colt's mother, and this neither surprised nor grieved him,

<BR>but rather gave him pleasure. He experienced a glad feeling of simultaneous

life in himself and in his offspring.



<P>But suddenly something flew near with a whistling sound and hit him

in the side, and with its sharp point entered his skin and flesh.

<BR>Feeling a burning pain, Esarhaddon -- who was at the same time the

ass -- tore the udder from the colt's teeth, and laying back his

<BR>ears galloped to the herd from which he had strayed. The colt kept

up with him, galloping by his side. They had already nearly

<BR>reached the herd, which had started off, when another arrow in full

flight struck the colt's neck. It pierced the skin and quivered in

<BR>its flesh. The colt sobbed piteously and fell upon its knees. Esarhaddon

could not abandon it, and remained standing over it. The

<BR>colt rose, tottered on its long, thin legs, and again fell. A fearful

two-legged being -- a man -- ran up and cut its throat.



<P>'This cannot be; it is still a dream! thought Esarhaddon, and made a

last effort to awake. 'Surely I am not Lailie, nor the ass, but

<BR>Esarhaddon!'



<P>He cried out, and at the same instant lifted his head out of the font.

. . . The old man was standing by him, pouring over his head

<BR>the last drops from the pitcher.



<P>'Oh, how terribly I have suffered! And for how long!' said Esarhaddon.



<P>'Long?' replied the old man, 'you have only dipped your head under water

and lifted it again; see, the water is not yet all out of the

<BR>pitcher. Do you now understand?'



<P>Esarhaddon did not reply, but only looked at the old man with terror.



<P>'Do you now understand,' continued the old man, 'that Lailie is you,

and the warriors you put to death were you also? And not the

<BR>warriors only, but the animals which you slew when hunting and ate

at your feasts were also you. You thought life dwelt in you

<BR>alone but I have drawn aside the veil of delusion, and have let you

see that by doing evil to others you have done it to yourself also.

<BR>Life is one in them all, and yours is but a portion of this same common

life. And only in that one part of life that is yours, can you

<BR>make life better or worse -- increasing or decreasing it. You can only

improve life in yourself by destroying the barriers that divide

<BR>your life from that of others, and by considering others as yourself,

and loving them. By so doing you increase your share of life.

<BR>You injure your life when you think of it as the only life, and try

to add to its welfare at the expense of other lives. By so doing you

<BR>only lessen it. To destroy the life that dwells in others is beyond

your power. The life of those you have slain has vanished from

<BR>your eyes, but is not destroyed. You thought to lengthen your own life

and to shorten theirs, but you cannot do this. Life knows

<BR>neither time nor space. The life of a moment, and the life of a thousand

years: your life and the life of all the visible and invisible

<BR>beings in the world, are equal. To destroy life, or to alter it, is

impossible; for life is the one thing that exists. All else, but seems

to

<BR>us to be.'



<P>Having said this the old man vanished.



<P>Next morning King Esarhaddon gave orders that Lailie and all the prisoners

should be set at liberty and that the executions should

<BR>cease.



<P>On the third day he called his son Assur-bani-pal, and gave the kingdom

over into his hands; and he himself went into the desert to

<BR>think over all he had learnt. Afterwards he went about as a wanderer

through the towns and villages, preaching to the people that

<BR>all life is one, and that when men wish to harm others, they really

do evil to themselves.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P><B>A LEGEND.</B>



<P>THIS is a legend current among the South American Indians.



<P>God, say they, at first made men so that they had no need to work: they

needed neither houses, nor clothes, nor food, and they all

<BR>lived till they were a hundred, and did not know what illness was.



<P>When, after some time, God looked to see how people were living, he

saw that instead of being happy in their life, they had

<BR>quarrelled with one another, and, each caring for himself, had brought

matters to such a pass that far from enjoying life, they

<BR>cursed it.



<P>Then God said to himself: 'This comes of their living separately, each

for himself.' And to change this state of things, God so

<BR>arranged matters that it became impossible for people to live without

working. To avoid suffering from cold and hunger, they were

<BR>now obliged to build dwellings, and to dig the ground, and to grow

and gather fruits and grain.



<P>'Work will bring them together,' thought God.



<P>'They cannot make their tools, prepare and transport their timber, build

their houses, sow and gather their harvests, spin and

<BR>weave, and make their clothes, each one alone by himself.'



<P>'It will make them understand that the more heartily they work together,

the more they will have and the better they will live; and

<BR>this will unite them.'



<P>Time passed on, and again God came to see how men were living, and whether

they were now happy.



<P>But he found them living worse than before. They worked together (that

they could not help doing), but not all together, being

<BR>broken up into little groups. And each group tried to snatch work from

other groups, and they hindered one another, wasting time

<BR>and strength in their struggles, so that things went ill with them

all.



<P>Having seen that this, too, was not well, God decided so as to arrange

things that man should not know the time of his death, but

<BR>might die at any moment; and he announced this to them.



<P>'Knowing that each of them may die at any moment,' thought God, 'they

will not, by grasping at gains that may last so short a time,

<BR>spoil the hours of life allotted to them.'



<P>But it turned out otherwise. When God returned to see how people were

living, he saw that their life was as bad as ever.



<P>Those who were strongest, availing themselves of the fact that men might

die at any time, subdued those who were weaker, killing

<BR>some and threatening others with death. And it came about that the

strongest and their descendants did no work, and suffered

<BR>from the weariness of idleness, while those who were weaker had to

work beyond their strength, and suffered from lack of rest.

<BR>Each set of men feared and hated the other. And the life of man became

yet more unhappy.



<P>Having seen all this, God, to mend matters, decided to make use of one

last means; he sent all kinds of sickness among men. God

<BR>thought that when all men were exposed to sickness they would understand

that those who are well should have pity on those who

<BR>are sick, and should help them, that when they themselves fall ill

those who are well might in turn help them.



<P>And again God went away, but when He came back to see how men lived

now that they were subject to sicknesses, he saw that

<BR>their life was worse even than before. The very sickness that in God's

purpose should have united men, had divided them more

<BR>than ever. Those men who were strong enough to make others work, forced

them also to wait on them in times of sickness; but

<BR>they did not, in their turn, look after others who were ill. And those

who were forced to work for others and to look after them

<BR>when sick, were so worn with work that they had no time to look after

their own sick, but left them without attendance. That the

<BR>sight of sick folk might not disturb the pleasures of the wealthy,

houses were arranged in which these poor people suffered and

<BR>died, far from those whose sympathy might have cheered them, and in

the arms of hired people who nursed them without

<BR>compassion, or even with disgust. Moreover, people considered many

of the illnesses infectious, and, fearing to catch them, not

<BR>only avoided the sick, but even separated themselves from those who

attended the sick.



<P>Then God said to Himself: 'If even this means will not bring men to

understand wherein their happiness lies, let them be taught by

<BR>suffering.' And God left men to themselves.



<P>And, left to themselves, men lived long before they understood that

they all ought to, and might be, happy. Only in the very latest

<BR>times have a few of them begun to understand that work ought not to

be a bugbear to some and like galley-slavery for others, but

<BR>should be a common and happy occupation, uniting all men. They have

begun to understand that with death constantly threatening

<BR>each of us, the only reasonable business of every man is to spend the

years, months, hours, and minutes, allotted him -- in unity and

<BR>love. They have begun to understand that sickness, far from dividing

men, should, on the contrary, give opportunity for loving union

<BR>with one another.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>THE REPENTANT SINNER</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>'And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy

Kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee,

<BR>Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.' -- Luke xxiii. 42, 43.



<P>THERE was once a man who lived for seventy years in the world, and lived

in sin all that time. He fell ill but even then did not

<BR>repent. Only at the last moment, as he was dying, he wept and said:



<P>'Lord! forgive me, as Thou forgavest the thief upon the cross.'



<P>And as he said these words, his soul left his body. And the soul of

the sinner, feeling love towards God and faith in His mercy,

<BR>went to the gates of heaven and knocked, praying to be let into the

heavenly kingdom.



<P>Then a voice spoke from within the gate:



<P>'What man is it that knocks at the gates of Paradise and what deeds

did he do during his life?'



<P>And the voice of the Accuser replied, recounting all the man's evil

deeds, and not a single good one.



<P>And the voice from within the gates answered:



<P>'Sinners cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. Go hence!'



<P>Then the man said:



<P>'Lord, I hear thy voice, but cannot see thy face, nor do I know thy

name.'



<P>The voice answered:



<P>'I am Peter, the Apostle.'



<P>And the sinner replied:



<P>'Have pity on me, Apostle Peter! Remember man's weakness, and God's

mercy. Wert not thou a disciple of Christ? Didst not thou

<BR>hear his teaching from his own lips, and hadst thou not his example

before thee? Remember then how, when he sorrowed and was

<BR>grieved in spirit, and three times asked thee to keep awake and pray,

thou didst sleep, because thine eyes were heavy, and three

<BR>times he found thee sleeping. So it was with me. Remember, also, how

thou didst promise to be faithful unto death, and yet didst

<BR>thrice deny him, when he was taken before Caiaphas. So it was with

me. And remember, too, how when the cock crowed thou

<BR>didst go out and didst weep bitterly. So it is with me. Thou canst

not refuse to let me in.'



<P>And the voice behind the gates was silent.



<P>Then the sinner stood a little while, and again began to knock, and

to ask to be let into the kingdom of heaven.



<P>And he heard another voice behind the gates, which said:



<P>'Who is this man, and how did he live on earth?'



<P>And the voice of the Accuser again repeated all the sinner's evil deeds,

and not a single good one.



<P>And the voice from behind the gates replied:



<P>'Go hence! Such sinners cannot live with us in Paradise.' Then the sinner

said:



<P>'Lord, I hear thy voice, but I see thee not, nor do I know thy name.'



<P>And the voice answered:



<P>'I am David; king and prophet.'



<P>The sinner did not despair, nor did he leave the gates of Paradise,

but said:



<P>Have pity on me, King David! Remember man's weakness, and God's mercy.

God loved thee and exalted thee among men. Thou

<BR>hadst all: a kingdom, and honour, and riches, and wives, and children;

but thou sawest from thy house-top the wife of a poor man,

<BR>and sin entered into thee, and thou tookest the wife of Uriah, and

didst slay him with the sword of the Ammonites. Thou, a rich

<BR>man, didst take from the poor man his one ewe lamb, and didst kill

him. I have done likewise. Remember, then, how thou didst

<BR>repent, and how thou saidst, "I acknowledge my transgressions: my sin

is ever before me?" I have done the same. Thou canst not

<BR>refuse to let me in.'



<P>And the voice from within the gates was silent.



<P>The sinner having stood a little while, began knocking again, and asking

to be let into the kingdom of heaven. And a third voice

<BR>was heard within the gates, saying:



<P>'Who is this man, and how has he spent his life on earth?'



<P>And the voice of the Accuser replied for the third time, recounting

the sinner's evil deeds, and not mentioning one good deed.



<P>And the voice within the gates said:



<P>'Depart hence! Sinners cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.'



<P>And the sinner said:



<P>'Thy voice I hear, but thy face I see not, neither do I know thy name.'



<P>Then the voice replied:



<P>'I am John the Divine, the beloved disciple of Christ.'



<P>And the sinner rejoiced and said:



<P>'Now surely I shall be allowed to enter. Peter and David must let me

in, because they know man's weakness and God's mercy;

<BR>and thou wilt let me in, because thou lovest much. Was it not thou,

John the Divine who wrote that God is Love, and that he who

<BR>loves not, knows not God? And in thine old age didst thou not say unto

men: "Brethren, love one another." How, then, canst thou

<BR>look on me with hatred, and drive me away? Either thou must renounce

what thou hast said, or loving me, must let me enter the

<BR>kingdom of heaven.'



<P>And the gates of Paradise opened, and John embraced the repentant sinner

and took him into the kingdom of heaven.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>IN a certain town there lived a cobbler, Martin Avd&eacute;iteh by name.

He had a tiny room in a basement, the one window of which

<BR>looked out on to the street. Through it one could only see the feet

of those who passed by, but Martin recognized the people by

<BR>their boots. He had lived long in the place and had many acquaintances.

There was hardly a pair of boots in the neighbourhood

<BR>that had not been once or twice through his hands, so he often saw

his own handiwork through the window. Some he had re-soled,

<BR>some patched, some stitched up, and to some he had even put fresh uppers.

He had plenty to do, for he worked well, used good

<BR>material, did not charge too much, and could be relied on. If he could

do a job by the day required, he undertook it; if not, he told

<BR>the truth and gave no false promises; so he was well known and never

short of work.



<P>Martin had always been a good man; but in his old age he began to think

more about his soul and to draw nearer to God. While he

<BR>still worked for a master, before he set up on his own account, his

wife had died, leaving him with a three-year old son. None of

<BR>his elder children had lived, they had all died in infancy. At first

Martin thought of sending his little son to his sister's in the country,

<BR>but then he felt sorry to part with the boy, thinking: 'It would be

hard for my little Kapit&oacute;n to have to grow up in a strange family;

I

<BR>will keep him with me.'



<P>Martin left his master and went into lodgings with his little son. But

he had no luck with his children. No sooner had the boy

<BR>reached an age when he could help his father and be a support as well

as a joy to him, than he fell ill and, after being laid up for a

<BR>week with a burning fever, died. Martin buried his son, and gave way

to despair so great and overwhelming that he murmured

<BR>against God. In his sorrow he prayed again and again that he too might

die, reproaching God for having taken the son he loved, his

<BR>only son while he, old as he was, remained alive. After that Martin

left off going to church.



<P>One day an old man from Martin's native village who had been a pilgrim

for the last eight years, called in on his way from Tr&oacute;itsa

<BR>Monastery. Martin opened his heart to him, and told him of his sorrow.



<P>'I no longer even wish to live, holy man,' he said. 'All I ask of God

is that I soon may die. I am now quite without hope in the

<BR>world.'



<P>The old man replied: 'You have no right to say such things, Martin.

We cannot judge God's ways. Not our reasoning, but God's

<BR>will, decides. If God willed that your son should die and you should

live, it must be best so. As to your despair -- that comes

<BR>because you wish to live for your own happiness.'



<P>'What else should one live for?' asked Martin.



<P>'For God, Martin,' said the old man. 'He gives you life, and you must

live for Him. When you have learnt to live for Him, you will

<BR>grieve no more, and all will seem easy to you.'



<P>Martin was silent awhile, and then asked: 'But how is one to live for

God?'



<P>The old man answered: 'How one may live for God has been shown us by

Christ. Can you read? Then buy the Gospels, and read

<BR>them: there you will see how God would have you live. You have it all

there.'



<P>These words sank deep into Martin's heart, and that same day he went

and bought himself a Testament in large print, and began

<BR>to read.



<P>At first he meant only to read on holidays, but having once begun he

found it made his heart so light that he read every day.

<BR>Sometimes he was so absorbed in his reading that the oil in his lamp

burnt out before he could tear himself away from the book.

<BR>He continued to read every night, and the more he read the more clearly

he understood what God required of him, and how he

<BR>might live for God. And his heart grew lighter and lighter. Before,

when he went to bed he used to lie with a heavy heart, moaning

<BR>as he thought of his little Kapit&oacute;n; but now he only repeated

again and again: 'Glory to Thee, glory to Thee, O Lord! Thy will be

<BR>done!'



<P>From that time Martin's whole life changed. Formerly, on holidays he

used to go and have tea at the public house, and did not even

<BR>refuse a glass or two of v&oacute;dka. Sometimes, after having had

a drop with a friend, he left the public house not drunk, but rather

<BR>merry, and would say foolish things: shout at a man, or abuse him.

Now, all that sort of thing passed away from him. His life

<BR>became peaceful and joyful. He sat down to his work in the morning,

and when he had finished his day's work he took the lamp

<BR>down from the wall, stood it on the table, fetched his book from the

shelf, opened it, and sat down to read. The more he read the

<BR>better he understood, and the clearer and happier he felt in his mind.



<P>It happened once that Martin sat up late, absorbed in his book. He was

reading Luke's Gospel; and in the sixth chapter he came

<BR>upon the verses:



<P>'To him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and

from him that taketh away thy cloke withhold not thy coat

<BR>also. Give to every man that asketh thee; and of him that taketh away

thy goods ask them not again. And as ye would that men

<BR>should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.'



<P>He also read the verses where our Lord says:



<P>'And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?

Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth

<BR>them, I will shew you to whom he is like: He is like a man which built

an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock:

<BR>and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house,

and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. But

<BR>he that heareth and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation

built an house upon the earth, against which the stream did

<BR>beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house

was great.'



<P>When Martin read these words his soul was glad within him. He took off

his spectacles and laid them on the book, and leaning his

<BR>elbows on the table pondered over what he had read. He tried his own

life by the standard of those words, asking himself:



<P>'Is my house built on the rock, or on sand? If it stands on the rock,

it is well. It seems easy enough while one sits here alone, and

<BR>one thinks one has done all that God commands; but as soon as I cease

to be on my guard, I sin again. Still I will persevere. It

<BR>brings such joy. Help me, O Lord!'



<P>He thought all this, and was about to go to bed, but was loth to leave

his book. So he went on reading the seventh chapter -- about

<BR>the centurion, the widow's son, and the answer to John's disciples

-- and he came to the part where a rich Pharisee invited the

<BR>Lord to his house; and he read how the woman who was a sinner, anointed

his feet and washed them with her tears, and how he

<BR>justified her. Coming to the forty-fourth verse, he read:



<P>'And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman?

I entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my

<BR>feet: but she hath wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with

her hair. Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, since the time I

<BR>came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst

not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.'



<P>He read these verses and thought: 'He gave no water for his feet, gave

no kiss, his head with oil he did not anoint. . . .' And Martin

<BR>took off his spectacles once more, laid them on his book, and pondered.



<P>'He must have been like me, that Pharisee. He too thought only of himself

-- how to get a cup of tea, how to keep warm and

<BR>comfortable; never a thought of his guest. He took care of himself,

but for his guest he cared nothing at all. Yet who was the

<BR>guest? The Lord himself! If he came to me, should I behave like that?'



<P>Then Martin laid his head upon both his arms and, before he was aware

of it, he fell asleep.



<P>'Martin!' he suddenly heard a voice, as if some one had breathed the

word above his ear.



<P>He started from his sleep. 'Who's there?' he asked.



<P>He turned round and looked at the door; no one was there. He called

again. Then he heard quite distinctly: 'Martin, Martin! Look

<BR>out into the street to-morrow, for I shall come.'



<P>Martin roused himself, rose from his chair and rubbed his eyes, but

did not know whether he had heard these words in a dream or

<BR>awake. He put out the lamp and lay down to sleep.



<P>Next morning he rose before daylight, and after saying his prayers he

lit the fire and prepared his cabbage soup and buckwheat

<BR>porridge. Then he lit the samov&aacute;r, put on his apron, and sat

down by the window to his work. As he sat working Martin thought

<BR>over what had happened the night before. At times it seemed to him

like a dream, and at times he thought that he had really heard

<BR>the voice. 'Such things have happened before now,' thought he.



<P>So he sat by the window, looking out into the street more than he worked,

and whenever any one passed in unfamiliar boots he

<BR>would stoop and look up, so as to see not the feet only but the face

of the passer-by as well. A house-porter passed in new felt

<BR>boots; then a water-carrier. Presently an old soldier of Nicholas'

reign came near the window spade in hand. Martin knew him by

<BR>his boots, which were shabby old felt ones, goloshed with leather.

The old man was called Step&aacute;niteh: a neighbouring tradesman

<BR>kept him in his house for charity, and his duty was to help the house-porter.

He began to clear away the snow before Martin's

<BR>window. Martin glanced at him and then went on with his work.



<P>'I must be growing crazy with age,' said Martin, laughing at his fancy.

'Step&aacute;nitch comes to clear away the snow, and I must needs

<BR>imagine it's Christ coming to visit me. Old dotard that I am!'



<P>Yet after he had made a dozen stitches he felt drawn to look out of

the window again. He saw that Step&aacute;nitch had leaned his

<BR>spade against the wall, and was either resting himself or trying to

get warm. The man was old and broken down, and had evidently

<BR>not enough strength even to clear away the snow.



<P>'What if I called him in and gave him some tea?' thought Martin. 'The

samov&aacute;r is just on the boil.'



<P>He stuck his awl in its place, and rose; and putting the samov&aacute;r

on the table, made tea. Then he tapped the window with his

<BR>fingers. Step&aacute;nitch turned and came to the window. Martin beckoned

to him to come in, and went himself to open the door.



<P>'Come in,' he said, 'and warm yourself a bit. I'm sure you must be cold.'



<P>'May God bless you!' Step&aacute;nitch answered. 'My bones do ache to

be sure.' He came in, first shaking off the snow, and lest he

<BR>should leave marks on the floor he began wiping his feet; but as he

did so he tottered and nearly fell.



<P>'Don't trouble to wipe your feet,' said Martin 'I'll wipe up the floor

-- it's all in the day's work. Come, friend, sit down and have

<BR>some tea.'



<P>Filling two tumblers, he passed one to his visitor, and pouring his

own out into the saucer, began to blow on it.



<P>Step&aacute;niteh emptied his glass, and, turning it upside down, put

the remains of his piece of sugar on the top. He began to express his

<BR>thanks, but it was plain that he would be glad of some more.



<P>'Have another glass,' said Martin, refilling the visitor's tumbler and

his own. But while he drank his tea Martin kept looking out into

<BR>the street.



<P>'Are you expecting any one?' asked the visitor.



<P>'Am I expecting any one? Well, now, I'm ashamed to tell you. It isn't

that I really expect any one; but I heard something last night

<BR>which I can't get out of my mind Whether it was a vision, or only a

fancy, I can't tell. You see, friend, last night I was reading the

<BR>Gospel, about Christ the Lord, how he suffered, and how he walked on

earth. You have heard tell of it, I dare say.'



<P>'I have heard tell of it,' answered Step&aacute;nitch; 'but I'm an ignorant

man and not able to read.'



<P>'Well, you see, I was reading of how he walked on earth. I came to that

part, you know, where he went to a Pharisee who did not

<BR>receive him well. Well, friend, as I read about it, I thought now that

man did not receive Christ the Lord with proper honour.

<BR>Suppose such a thing could happen to such a man as myself, I thought,

what would I not do to receive him! But that man gave him

<BR>no reception at all. Well, friend, as I was thinking of this, I began

to doze, and as I dozed I heard some one call me by name. I got

<BR>up, and thought I heard some one whispering, "Expect me; I will come

to-morrow." This happened twice over. And to tell you the

<BR>truth, it sank so into my mind that, though I am ashamed of it myself,

I keep on expecting him, the dear Lord!'



<P>Step&aacute;nitch shook his head in silence, finished his tumbler and

laid it on its side; but Martin stood it up again and refilled it for him.



<P>'Here drink another glass, bless you! And I was thinking too, how he

walked on earth and despised no one, but went mostly among

<BR>common folk. He went with plain people, and chose his disciples from

among the likes of us, from workmen like us, sinners that

<BR>we are. "He who raises himself," he said, "shall be humbled and he

who humbles himself shall be raised." "You call me Lord," he

<BR>said, "and I will wash your feet." "He who would be first," he said,

"let him be the servant of all; because," he said, "blessed are the

<BR>poor, the humble, the meek, and the merciful."'



<P>Step&aacute;nitch forgot his tea. He was an old man easily moved to

tears, and as he sat and listened the tears ran down his cheeks.



<P>'Come, drink some more,' said Martin. But Step&aacute;nitch crossed

himself, thanked him, moved away his tumbler, and rose.



<P>'Thank you, Martin Avd&eacute;itch,' he said, 'you have given me food

and comfort both for soul and body.'



<P>'You're very welcome. Come again another time. I am glad to have a guest,'

said Martin.



<P>Step&aacute;nitch went away; and Martin poured out the last of the tea

and drank it up. Then he put away the tea things and sat down to

<BR>his work, stitching the back seam of a boot. And as he stitched he

kept looking out of the window, waiting for Christ, and thinking

<BR>about him and his doings. And his head was full of Christ's sayings.



<P>Two soldiers went by: one in Government boots the other in boots of

his own; then the master of a neighbouring house, in shining

<BR>goloshes; then a baker carrying a basket. All these passed on. Then

a woman came up in worsted stockings and peasant-made

<BR>shoes. She passed the window, but stopped by the wall. Martin glanced

up at her through the window, and saw that she was a

<BR>stranger, poorly dressed, and with a baby in her arms. She stopped

by the wall with her back to the wind, trying to wrap the baby

<BR>up though she had hardly anything to wrap it in. The woman had only

summer clothes on, and even they were shabby and worn.

<BR>Through the window Martin heard the baby crying, and the woman trying

to soothe it, but unable to do so. Martin rose and going

<BR>out of the door and up the steps he called to her.



<P>'My dear, I say, my dear!'



<P>The woman heard, and turned round.



<P>'Why do you stand out there with the baby in the cold? Come inside.

You can wrap him up better in a warm place. Come this

<BR>way!'



<P>The woman was surprised to see an old man in an apron, with spectacles

on his nose, calling to her, but she followed him in.



<P>They went down the steps, entered the little room, and the old man led

her to the bed.



<P>'There, sit down, my dear, near the stove. Warm yourself, and feed the

baby.'



<P>'Haven't any milk. I have eaten nothing myself since early morning,'

said the woman, but still she took the baby to her breast.



<P>Martin shook his head. He brought out a basin and some bread. Then he

opened the oven door and poured some cabbage soup

<BR>into the basin. He took out the porridge pot also but the porridge

was not yet ready, so he spread a cloth on the table and served

<BR>only the soup and bread.



<P>'Sit down and eat, my dear, and I'll mind the baby. Why, bless me, I've

had children of my own; I know how to manage them.'



<P>The woman crossed herself, and sitting down at the table began to eat,

while Martin put the baby on the bed and sat down by it.

<BR>He chucked and chucked, but having no teeth he could not do it well

and the baby continued to cry. Then Martin tried poking at

<BR>him with his finger; he drove his finger straight at the baby's mouth

and then quickly drew it back, and did this again and again. He

<BR>did not let the baby take his finger in its mouth, because it was all

black with cobbler's wax. But the baby first grew quiet watching

<BR>the finger, and then began to laugh. And Martin felt quite pleased.



<P>The woman sat eating and talking, and told him who she was, and where

she had been.



<P>'I'm a soldier's wife,' said she. 'They sent my husband somewhere, far

away, eight months ago, and I have heard nothing of him

<BR>since. I had a place as cook till my baby was born, but then they would

not keep me with a child. For three months now I have

<BR>been struggling, unable to find a place, and I've had to sell all I

had for food. I tried to go as a wet-nurse, but no one would have

<BR>me; they said I was too starved-looking and thin. Now I have just been

to see a tradesman's wife (a woman from our village is in

<BR>service with her) and she has promised to take me. I thought it was

all settled at last, but she tells me not to come till next week. It

<BR>is far to her place, and I am fagged out, and baby is quite starved,

poor mite. Fortunately our landlady has pity on us, and lets us

<BR>lodge free, else I don't know what we should do.'



<P>Martin sighed. 'Haven't you any warmer clothing?' he asked.



<P>'How could I get warm clothing?' said she. 'Why I pawned my last shawl

for sixpence yesterday.'



<P>Then the woman came and took the child, and Martin got up. He went and

looked among some things that were hanging on the

<BR>wall, and brought back an old cloak.



<P>'Here,' he said, 'though it's a worn-out old thing, it will do to wrap

him up in.'



<P>The woman looked at the cloak, then at the old man, and taking it, burst

into tears. Martin turned away, and groping under the bed

<BR>brought out a small trunk. He fumbled about in it, and again sat down

opposite the woman. And the woman said:



<P>'The Lord bless you, friend. Surely Christ must have sent me to your

window, else the child would have frozen. It was mild when I

<BR>started, but now see how cold it has turned. Surely it must have been

Christ who made you look out of your window and take pity

<BR>on me, poor wretch!'



<P>Martin smiled and said; 'It is quite true; it was he made me do it.

It was no mere chance made me look out.'



<P>And he told the woman his dream, and how he had heard the Lord's voice

promising to visit him that day.



<P>'Who knows? All things are possible,' said the woman. And she got up

and threw the cloak over her shoulders, wrapping it round

<BR>herself and round the baby. Then she bowed, and thanked Martin once

more.



<P>'Take this for Christ's sake,' said Martin, and gave her sixpence to

get her shawl out of pawn. The woman crossed herself, and

<BR>Martin did the same, and then he saw her out.



<P>After the woman had gone, Martin ate some cabbage soup, cleared the

things away, and sat down to work again. He sat and

<BR>worked, but did not forget the window, and every time a shadow fell

on it he looked up at once to see who was passing. People he

<BR>knew and strangers passed by, but no one remarkable.



<P>After a while Martin saw an apple-woman stop just in front of his window.

She had a large basket, but there did not seem to be

<BR>many apples left in it; she had evidently sold most of her stock. On

her back she had a sack full of chips, which she was taking

<BR>home. No doubt she had gathered them at some place where building was

going on. The sack evidently hurt her, and she wanted

<BR>to shift it from one shoulder to the other, so she put it down on the

footpath and, placing her basket on a post, began to shake down

<BR>the chips in the sack. While she was doing this a boy in a tattered

cap ran up, snatched an apple out of the basket, and tried to slip

<BR>away; but the old woman noticed it, and turning, caught the boy by

his sleeve. He began to struggle, trying to free himself, but the

<BR>old woman held on with both hands, knocked his cap off his head, and

seized hold of his hair. The boy screamed and the old

<BR>woman scolded. Martin dropped his awl, not waiting to stick it in its

place, and rushed out of the door. Stumbling up the steps, and

<BR>dropping his spectacles in his hurry, he ran out into the street. The

old woman was pulling the boy's hair and scolding him, and

<BR>threatening to take him to the police. The lad was struggling and protesting,

saying, 'I did not take it. What are you beating me for?

<BR>Let me go!'



<P>Martin separated them. He took the boy by the hand and said, 'Let him

go, Granny. Forgive him for Christ's sake.'



<P>'I'll pay him out, so that he won't forget it for a year! I'll take

the rascal to the police!'



<P>Martin began entreating the old woman.



<P>'Let him go, Granny. He won't do it again. Let him go for Christ's sake!'



<P>The old woman let go, and the boy wished to run away, but Martin stopped

him



<P>'Ask the Granny's forgiveness!' said he. 'And don't do it another time.

I saw you take the apple.'



<P>The boy began to cry and to beg pardon.



<P>'That's right. And now here's an apple for you, and Martin took an apple

from the basket and gave it to the boy, saying, 'I will pay

<BR>you, Granny.'



<P>'You will spoil them that way, the young rascals,' said the old woman.

'He ought to be whipped so that he should remember it for a

<BR>week.'



<P>'Oh, Granny, Granny,' said Martin, 'that's our way -- but it's not God's

way. If he should be whipped for stealing an apple, what

<BR>should be done to us for our sins?'



<P>The old woman was silent.



<P>And Martin told her the parable of the lord who forgave his servant

a large debt, and how the servant went out and seized his

<BR>debtor by the throat. The old woman listened to it all, and the boy,

too, stood by and listened.



<P>'God bids us forgive,' said Martin, 'or else we shall not be forgiven.

Forgive every one; and a thoughtless youngster most of all.'



<P>The old woman wagged her head and sighed.



<P>'It's true enough,' said she, 'but they are getting terribly spoilt.'



<P>'Then we old ones must show them better ways,' Martin replied.



<P>'That's just what I say,' said the old woman. 'I have had seven of them

myself, and only one daughter is left.' And the old woman

<BR>began to tell how and where she was living with her daughter, and how

many grandchildren she had. 'There now,' she said, 'I have

<BR>but little strength left, yet I work hard for the sake of my grandchildren;

and nice children they are, too. No one comes out to meet

<BR>me but the children. Little Annie, now, won't leave me for any one.

"It's grandmother, dear grandmother, darling grandmother."'

<BR>And the old woman completely softened at the thought.



<P>'Of course, it was only his childishness, God help him,' said she, referring

to the boy.



<P>As the old woman was about to hoist her sack on her back, the lad sprang

forward to her, saying, 'Let me carry it for you, Granny.

<BR>I'm going that way.'



<P>The old woman nodded her head, and put the sack on the boy's back, and

they went down the street together, the old woman quite

<BR>forgetting to ask Martin to pay for the apple. Martin stood and watched

them as they went along talking to each other.



<P>When they were out of sight Martin went back to the house. Having found

his spectacles unbroken on the steps, he picked up his

<BR>awl and sat down again to work. He worked a little, but could soon

not see to pass the bristle through the holes in the leather; and

<BR>presently he noticed the lamplighter passing on his way to light the

street lamps.



<P>'Seems it's time to light up,' thought he. So he trimmed his lamp, hung

it up, and sat down again to work. He finished off one boot

<BR>and, turning it about, examined it. It was all right. Then he gathered

his tools together, swept up the cuttings, put away the bristles

<BR>and the thread and the awls, and, taking down the lamp, placed it on

the table. Then he took the Gospels from the shelf. He meant

<BR>to open them at the place he had marked the day before with a bit of

morocco, but the book opened at another place. As Martin

<BR>opened it, his yesterday's dream came back to his mind, and no sooner

had he thought of it than he seemed to hear footsteps, as

<BR>though some one were moving behind him. Martin turned round, and it

seemed to him as if people were standing in the dark

<BR>corner, but he could not make out who they were. And a voice whispered

in his ear: 'Martin, Martin, don't you know me?'



<P>'Who is it?' muttered Martin.



<P>'It is I,' said the voice. And out of the dark corner stepped Step&aacute;nitch,

who smiled and vanishing like a cloud was seen no more.



<P>'It is I,' said the voice again. And out of the darkness stepped the

woman with the baby in her arms and the woman smiled and the

<BR>baby laughed, and they too vanished.



<P>'It is I,' said the voice once more. And the old woman and the boy with

the apple stepped out and both smiled, and then they too

<BR>vanished.



<P>And Martin's soul grew glad. He crossed himself put on his spectacles,

and began reading the Gospel just where it had opened;

<BR>and at the top of the page he read



<P>'I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me

drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in.'



<P>And at the bottom of the page he read



<P>'Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren even these least,

ye did it unto me' (Matt. xxv).



<P>And Martin understood that his dream had come true; and that the Saviour

had really come to him that day, and he had welcomed

<BR>him.

<P>'Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for

a tooth, but I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil.' -- Matt.

<BR>v. 38, 39.



<P>'Vengeance is mine; I will repay.' -- Rom. xii. 19.



<P>I



<P>A SON was born to a poor peasant. He was glad and went to his neighbour

to ask him to stand godfather to the boy. The

<BR>neighbour refused -- he did not like standing godfather to a poor man's

child. The peasant asked another neighbour, but he too

<BR>refused, and after that the poor father went to every house in the

village, but found no one willing to be godfather to his son. So he

<BR>set off to another village, and on the way he met a man who stopped

and said:



<P>'Good-day, my good man; where are you off to?'



<P>'God has given me a child,' said the peasant, 'to rejoice my eyes in

youth, to comfort my old age, and to pray for my soul after

<BR>death. But I am poor, and no one in our village will stand godfather

to him, so I am now on my way to seek a godfather for him

<BR>elsewhere.'



<P>'Let me be godfather,' said the stranger.



<P>The peasant was glad, and thanked him, but added: 'And whom shall I

ask to be godmother?'



<P>'Go to the town,' replied the stranger, 'and, in the square, you will

see a stone house with shop-windows in the front. At the

<BR>entrance you will find the tradesman to whom it belongs. Ask him to

let his daughter stand godmother to your child.'



<P>The peasant hesitated.



<P>'How can I ask a rich tradesman?' said he. 'He will despise me, and

will not let his daughter come.'



<P>'Don't trouble about that. Go and ask. Get everything ready by to-morrow

morning, and I will come to the christening.'



<P>The poor peasant returned home, and then drove to the town to find the

tradesman. He had hardly taken his horse into the yard,

<BR>when the tradesman himself came out.



<P>'What do you want?' said he.



<P>'Why, sir,' said the peasant, 'you see God has given me a son to rejoice

my eyes in youth, to comfort my old age, and to pray for

<BR>my soul after death. Be so kind as to let your daughter stand godmother

to him.



<P>'And when is the christening?' said the tradesman.



<P>'To-morrow morning.'



<P>'Very well. Go in peace. She shall be with you at Mass to-morrow morning.'



<P>The next day the godmother came, and the godfather also, and the infant

was baptized. Immediately after the christening the

<BR>godfather went away. They did not know who he was, and never saw him

again.



<P>II



<P>The child grew up to be a joy to his parents. He was strong, willing

to work, clever and obedient. When he was ten years old his

<BR>parents sent him to school to learn to read and write. What others

learnt in five years, he learnt in one, and soon there was nothing

<BR>more they could teach him.



<P>Easter came round, and the boy went to see his godmother, to give her

his Easter greeting.



<P>'Father and mother,' said he when he got home again, 'where does my

godfather live? I should like to give him my Easter greeting,

<BR>too.'



<P>And his father answered:



<P>'We know nothing about your godfather, dear son. We often regret it

ourselves. Since the day you were christened we have never

<BR>seen him, nor had any news of him. We do not know where he lives, or

even whether he is still alive.'



<P>The son bowed to his parents.



<P>'Father and mother,' said he, 'let me go and look for my godfather.

I must find him and give him my Easter greeting.



<P>So his father and mother let him go, and the boy set off to find his

godfather.



<P>III



<P>The boy left the house and set out along the road. He had been walking

for several hours when he met a stranger who stopped

<BR>him and said:



<P>'Good-day to you, my boy. Where are you going?'



<P>And the boy answered:



<P>'I went to see my godmother and to give her my Easter greeting, and

when I got home I asked my parents where my godfather

<BR>lives, that I might go and greet him also. They told me they did not

know. They said he went away as soon as I was christened,

<BR>and they know nothing about him, not even if he be still alive. But

I wished to see my godfather, and so I have set out to look for

<BR>him.'



<P>Then the stranger said: 'I am your godfather.'



<P>The boy was glad to hear this. After kissing his godfather three times

for an Easter greeting, he asked him:



<P>'Which way are you going now, godfather? If you are coming our way,

please come to our house; but if you are going home, I will

<BR>go with you.'



<P>'I have no time now,' replied his godfather, 'to come to your house.

I have business in several villages; but I shall return home

<BR>again to-morrow. Come and see me then.'



<P>'But how shall I find you, godfather?'



<P>'When you leave home, go straight towards the rising sun, and you will

come to a forest; going through the forest you will come to

<BR>a glade. When you reach this glade sit down and rest awhile, and look

around you and see what happens. On the further side of

<BR>the forest you will find a garden, and in it a house with a golden

roof. That is my home. Go up to the gate, and I will myself be

<BR>there to meet you.'



<P>And having said this the godfather disappeared from his godson's sight.



<P>IV



<P>The boy did as his godfather had told him. He walked eastward until

he reached a forest, and there he came to a glade, and in the

<BR>midst of the glade he saw a pine tree to a branch of which was tied

a rope supporting a heavy log of oak. Close under this log

<BR>stood a wooden trough filled with honey. Hardly had the boy had time

to wonder why the honey was placed there, and why the log

<BR>hung above it, when he heard a crackling in the wood, and saw some

bears approaching; a she-bear, followed by a yearling and

<BR>three tiny cubs. The she-bear, sniffing the air, went straight to the

trough, the cubs following her. She thrust her muzzle into the

<BR>honey, and called the cubs to do the same. They scampered up and began

to eat. As they did so, the log, which the she-bear had

<BR>moved aside with her head, swung away a little and, returning, gave

the cubs a push. Seeing this the she-bear shoved the log away

<BR>with her paw. It swung further out and returned more forcibly, striking

one cub on the back and another on the head. The cubs ran

<BR>away howling with pain, and the mother, with a growl, caught the log

in her fore paws and, raising it above her head flung it away.

<BR>The log flew high in the air and the yearling, rushing to the trough,

pushed his muzzle into the honey and began to suck noisily. The

<BR>others also drew near, but they had not reached the trough when the

log, flying back, struck the yearling on the head and killed

<BR>him. The mother growled louder than before and, seizing the log, flung

it from her with all her might. It flew higher than the branch

<BR>it was tied to; so high that the rope slackened; and the she-bear returned

to the trough, and the little cubs after her. The log flew

<BR>higher and higher, then stopped, and began to fall. The nearer it came

the faster it swung, and at last, at full speed, it crashed down

<BR>on her head. The she-bear rolled over, her legs jerked and she died!

The cubs ran away into the forest.



<P>V



<P>The boy watched all this in surprise, and then continued his way. Leaving

the forest, he came upon a large garden in the midst of

<BR>which stood a lofty palace with a golden roof. At the gate stood his

godfather, smiling. He welcomed his godson, and led him

<BR>through the gateway into the garden. The boy had never dreamed of such

beauty and delight as surrounded him in that place.



<P>Then his godfather led him into the palace, which was even more beautiful

inside than outside. The godfather showed the boy

<BR>through all the rooms: each brighter and finer than the other, but

at last they came to one door that was sealed up.



<P>'You see this door,' said he. 'It is not locked, but only sealed. It

can be opened, but I forbid you to open it. You may live here, and

<BR>go where you please and enjoy all the delights of the place. My only

command is -- do not open that door! But should you ever do

<BR>so, remember what you saw in the forest.'



<P>Having said this the godfather went away. The godson remained in the

palace, and life there was so bright and joyful that he

<BR>thought he had only been there three hours, when he had really lived

there thirty years. When thirty years had gone by, the godson

<BR>happened to be passing the sealed door one day, and he wondered why

his godfather had forbidden him to enter that room.



<P>'I'll just look in and see what is there,' thought he, and he gave the

door a push. The seals gave way, the door opened, and the

<BR>godson entering saw a hall more lofty and beautiful than all the others,

and in the midst of it a throne. He wandered about the hall

<BR>for a while, and then mounted the steps and seated himself upon the

throne. As he sat there he noticed a sceptre leaning against

<BR>the throne, and took it in his hand. Hardly had he done so when the

four walls of the hall suddenly disappeared. The godson looked

<BR>around, and saw the whole world, and all that men were doing in it.

He looked in front, and saw the sea with ships sailing on it. He

<BR>looked to the right, and saw where strange heathen people lived. He

looked to the left, and saw where men who were Christians,

<BR>but not Russians, lived. He looked round, and on the fourth side, he

saw Russian people, like himself.



<P>'I will look,' said he, 'and see what is happening at home, and whether

the harvest is good.'



<P>He looked towards his father's fields and saw the sheaves standing in

stooks. He began counting them to see whether there was

<BR>much corn, when he noticed a peasant driving in a cart. It was night,

and the godson thought it was his father coming to cart the

<BR>corn by night. But as he looked he recognized Vas&iacute;ly Koudryash&oacute;f,

the thief, driving into the field and beginning to load the

<BR>sheaves on to his cart. This made the godson angry, and he called out:



<P>'Father, the sheaves are being stolen from our field!'



<P>His father, who was out with the horses in the night-pasture, woke up.



<P>'I dreamt the sheaves were being stolen,' said he. 'I will just ride

down and see.'



<P>So he got on a horse and rode out to the field. Finding Vas&iacute;ly

there, he called together other peasants to help him, and Vas&iacute;ly

was

<BR>beaten, bound, and taken to prison.



<P>Then the godson looked at the town, where his godmother lived. He saw

that she was now married to a tradesman. She lay

<BR>asleep, and her husband rose and went to his mistress. The godson shouted

to her:



<P>'Get up, get up, your husband has taken to evil ways.'



<P>The godmother jumped up and dressed, and finding out where her husband

was, she shamed and beat his mistress, and drove him

<BR>away.



<P>Then the godson looked for his mother, and saw her lying asleep in her

cottage. And a thief crept into the cottage and began to

<BR>break open the chest in which she kept her things. The mother awoke

and screamed, and the robber seizing an axe, swung it over

<BR>his head to kill her.



<P>The godson could not refrain from hurling the sceptre at the robber.

It struck him upon the temple, and killed him on the spot.



<P>VI



<P>As soon as the godson had killed the robber, the walls closed and the

hall became just as it had been before.



<P>Then the door opened and the godfather entered, and coming up to his

godson he took him by the hand and led him down from the

<BR>throne.



<P>'You have not obeyed my command,' said he. 'You did one wrong thing,

when you opened the forbidden door; another, when you

<BR>mounted the throne and took my sceptre into your hands; and you have

now done a third wrong, which has much increased the

<BR>evil in the world. Had you sat here an hour longer, you would have

ruined half mankind.'



<P>Then the godfather led his godson back to the throne, and took the sceptre

in his hand; and again the walls fell asunder and all

<BR>things became visible. And the godfather said:



<P>'See what you have done to your father. Vas&iacute;ly has now been a

year in prison, and has come out having learnt every kind of

<BR>wickedness, and has become quite incorrigible. See, he has stolen two

of your father's horses, and he is now setting fire to his

<BR>barn. All this you have brought upon your father.'



<P>The godson saw his father's barn breaking into flames, but his godfather

shut off the sight from him, and told him to look another

<BR>way.



<P>'Here is your godmother's husband,' he said. 'It is a year since he

left his wife, and now he goes after other women. His former

<BR>mistress has sunk to still lower depths. Sorrow has driven his wife

to drink. That's what you have done to your godmother.'



<P>The godfather shut off this also, and showed the godson his father's

house. There he saw his mother weeping for her sins,

<BR>repenting, and saying:



<P>'It would have been better had the robber killed me that night. I should

not have sinned so heavily.'



<P>'That,' said the godfather, 'is what you have done to your mother.'



<P>He shut this off also, and pointed downwards; and the godson saw two

warders holding the robber in front of a prison-house.



<P>And the godfather said:



<P>'This man had murdered ten men. He should have expiated his sins himself,

but by killing him you have taken his sins on yourself.

<BR>Now you must answer for all his sins. That is what you have done to

yourself. The she-bear pushed the log aside once, and

<BR>disturbed her cubs; she pushed it again, and killed her yearling; she

pushed it a third time, and was killed herself. You have done

<BR>the same. Now I give you thirty years to go into the world and atone

for the robber's sins. If you do not atone for them, you will

<BR>have to take his place.'



<P>'How am I to atone for his sins?' asked the godson.



<P>And the godfather answered:



<P>'When you have rid the world of as much evil as you have brought into

it, you will have atoned both for your own sins and for

<BR>those of the robber.'



<P>'How can I destroy evil in the world?' the godson asked.



<P>'Go out,' replied the godfather, 'and walk straight towards the rising

sun. After a time you will come to a field with some men in it.

<BR>Notice what they are doing, and teach them what you know. Then go on

and note what you see. On the fourth day you will come

<BR>to a forest. In the midst of the forest is a cell and in the cell lives

a hermit. Tell him all that has happened. He will teach you what

<BR>to do. When you have done all he tells you, you will have atoned for

your own and the robber's sins.'



<P>And, having said this, the godfather led his godson out of the gate.



<P>VII



<P>The godson went his way, and as he went he thought: How am I to destroy

evil in the world? Evil is destroyed by banishing evil

<BR>men, keeping them in prison, or putting them to death. How then am

I to destroy evil without taking the sins of others upon

<BR>myself?'



<P>The godson pondered over it for a long time, but could come to no conclusion.

He went on until he came to a field where corn was

<BR>growing thick and good and ready for the reapers. The godson saw that

a little calf had got in among the corn. Some men who

<BR>were at hand saw it, and mounting their horses they chased it backwards

and forwards through the corn. Each time the calf was

<BR>about to come out of the corn some one rode up and the calf got frightened

and turned back again, and they all galloped after it,

<BR>trampling down the corn. On the road stood a woman crying.



<P>'They will chase my calf to death,' she said.



<P>And the godson said to the peasants:



<P>'What are you doing? Come out of the cornfield all of you, and let the

woman call her calf.'



<P>The men did so; and the woman came to the edge of the cornfield and

called to the calf. 'Come along browney, come along,' said

<BR>she. The calf pricked up its ears, listened a while, and then ran towards

the woman of its own accord, and hid its head in her skirts,

<BR>almost knocking her over. The men were glad the woman was glad, and

so was the little calf.



<P>The godson went on, and he thought:



<P>'Now I see that evil spreads evil. The more people try to drive away

evil, the more the evil grows. Evil, it seems, cannot be

<BR>destroyed by evil; but in what way it can be destroyed, I do not know.

The calf obeyed its mistress and so all went well; but if it

<BR>had not obeyed her, how could we have got it out of the field?'



<P>The godson pondered again, but came to no conclusion, and continued

his way.



<P>VIII



<P>He went on until he came to a village. At the furthest end he stopped

and asked leave to stay the night. The woman of the house

<BR>was there alone, house-cleaning, and she let him in. The godson entered,

and taking his seat upon the brick oven he watched what

<BR>the woman was doing. He saw her finish scrubbing the room and begin

scrubbing the table. Having done this, she began wiping

<BR>the table with a dirty cloth. She wiped it from side to side -- but

it did not come clean. The soiled cloth left streaks of dirt. Then she

<BR>wiped it the other way. The first streaks disappeared, but others came

in their place. Then she wiped it from one end to the other,

<BR>but again the same thing happened. The soiled cloth messed the table;

when one streak was wiped off another was left on. The

<BR>godson watched for awhile in silence, and then said:



<P>'What are you doing, mistress?'



<P>'Don't you see I'm cleaning up for the holiday. Only I can't manage

this table, it won't come clean. I'm quite tired out.'



<P>'You should rinse your cloth,' said the godson, 'before you wipe the

table with it.'



<P>The woman did so, and soon had the table clean.



<P>'Thank you for telling me,' said she.



<P>In the morning he took leave of the woman and went on his way. After

walking a good while, he came to the edge of a forest.

<BR>There he saw some peasants who were making wheel-rims of bent wood.

Coming nearer, the godson saw that the men were

<BR>going round and round, but could not bend the wood.



<P>He stood and looked on, and noticed that the block, to which the piece

of wood was fastened, was not fixed, but as the men

<BR>moved round it went round too. Then the godson said:



<P>'What are you doing, friends?'



<P>'Why, don't you see, we are making wheel rims. We have twice steamed

the wood, and are quite tired out, but the wood will not

<BR>bend.'



<P>'You should fix the block, friends,' said the godson, 'or else it goes

round when you do.'



<P>The peasants took his advice and fixed the block, and then the work

went on merrily.



<P>The godson spent the night with them, and then went on. He walked all

day and all night, and just before dawn he came upon

<BR>some drovers encamped for the night, and lay down beside them. He saw

that they had got all their cattle settled, and were trying

<BR>to light a fire. They had taken dry twigs and lighted them, but before

the twigs had time to burn up, they smothered them with

<BR>damp brushwood. The brushwood hissed and the fire smouldered and went

out. Then the drovers brought more dry wood, lit it,

<BR>and again put on the brushwood -- and again the fire went out. They

struggled with it for a long time, but could not get the fire to

<BR>burn. Then the godson said:



<P>'Do not be in such a hurry to put on the brushwood. Let the dry wood

burn up properly before you put any on. When the fire is

<BR>well alight you can put on as much as you please.'



<P>The drovers followed his advice. They let the fire burn up fiercely

before adding the brushwood, which then flared up so that they

<BR>soon had a roaring fire.



<P>The godson remained with them for a while, and then continued his way.

He went on, wondering what the three things he had

<BR>seen might mean; but he could not fathom them.



<P>IX



<P>The godson walked the whole of that day, and in the evening came to

another forest. There he found a hermit's cell, at which he

<BR>knocked.



<P>'Who is there?' asked a voice from within.



<P>'A great sinner,' replied the godson. I must atone for another's sins

as well as for my own.



<P>The hermit hearing this came out.



<P>'What sins are those that you have to bear for another?'



<P>The godson told him everything: about his godfather; about the she-bear

with the cubs; about the throne in the sealed room; about

<BR>the commands his godfather had given him, as well as about the peasants

he had seen trampling down the corn, and the calf that

<BR>ran out when its mistress called it.



<P>'I have seen that one cannot destroy evil by evil,' said he, 'but I

cannot understand how it is to be destroyed. Teach me how it can

<BR>be done.



<P>'Tell me,' replied the hermit, 'what else you have seen on your way.'



<P>The godson told him about the woman washing the table, and the men making

cart-wheels, and the drovers fighting their fire.



<P>The hermit listened to it all, and then went back to his cell and brought

out an old jagged axe.



<P>'Come with me,' said he.



<P>When they had gone some way, the hermit pointed to a tree.



<P>'Cut it down,' he said.



<P>The godson felled the tree.



<P>'Now chop it into three,' said the hermit.



<P>The godson chopped the tree into three pieces. Then the hermit went

back to his cell, and brought out some blazing sticks.



<P>'Burn those three logs,' said he.



<P>So the godson made a fire, and burnt the three logs till only three

charred stumps remained.



<P>'Now plant them half in the ground, like this.'



<P>The godson did so.



<P>'You see that river at the foot of the hill. Bring water from there

in your mouth, and water these stumps. Water this stump, as you

<BR>taught the woman: this one as you taught the wheel-wrights: and this

one, as you taught the drovers. When all three have taken

<BR>root and from these charred stumps apple-trees have sprung you will

know how to destroy evil in men, and will have atoned for all

<BR>your sins.'



<P>Having said this, the hermit returned to his cell. The godson pondered

for a long time, but could not understand what the hermit

<BR>meant. Nevertheless he set to work to do as he had been told.



<P>The godson went down to the river, filled his mouth with water, and

returning, emptied it on to one of the charred stumps. This he

<BR>did again and again, and watered all three-stumps. When he was hungry

and quite tired out, he went to the cell to ask the old

<BR>hermit for some food. He opened the door, and there upon a bench he

saw the old man lying dead. The godson looked round for

<BR>food, and he found some dried bread and ate a little of it. Then he

took a spade and set to work to dig the hermit's grave. During

<BR>the night he carried water and watered the stumps, and in the day he

dug the grave. He had hardly finished the grave and was

<BR>about to bury the corpse, when some people from the village came, bringing

food for the old man.



<P>The people heard that the old hermit was dead, and that he had given

the godson his blessing, and left him in his place. So they

<BR>buried the old man, gave the bread they had brought to the godson,

and promising to bring him some more, they went away.



<P>The godson remained in the old man's place. There he lived, eating the

food people brought him, and doing as he had been told:

<BR>carrying water from the river in his mouth and watering the charred

stumps.



<P>He lived thus for a year, and many people visited him. His fame spread

abroad, as a holy man who lived in the forest and brought

<BR>water from the bottom of a hill in his mouth to water charred stumps

for the salvation of his soul. People flocked to see him. Rich

<BR>merchants drove up bringing him presents, but he kept only the barest

necessaries for himself, and gave the rest away to the poor.



<P>And so the godson lived: carrying water in his mouth and watering the

stumps half the day, and resting and receiving people the

<BR>other half. And he began to think that this was the way he had been

told to live, in order to destroy evil and atone for his sins.



<P>He spent two years in this manner, not omitting for a single day to

water the stumps. But still not one of them sprouted.



<P>One day, as he sat in his cell, he heard a man ride past, singing as

he went. The godson came out to see what sort of a man it

<BR>was. He saw a strong young fellow, well dressed, and mounted on a handsome,

well-saddled horse.



<P>The godson stopped him, and asked him who he was, and where he was going.



<P>'I am a robber,' the man answered, drawing rein. 'I ride about the highways

killing people; and the more I kill, the merrier are the

<BR>songs I sing.'



<P>The godson was horror-struck, and thought:



<P>'How can the evil be destroyed in such a man as this? It is easy to

speak to those who come to me of their own accord and

<BR>confess their sins. But this one boasts of the evil he does.'



<P>So he said nothing, and turned away, thinking: 'What am I to do now?

This robber may take to riding about here, and he will

<BR>frighten away the people. They will leave off coming to me. It will

be a loss to them, and I shall not know how to live.'



<P>So the godson turned back, and said to the robber:



<P>'People come to me here, not to boast of their sins, but to repent,

and to pray for forgiveness. Repent of your sins, if you fear God;

<BR>but if there is no repentance in your heart, then go away and never

come here again. Do not trouble me, and do not frighten people

<BR>away from me. If you do not hearken, God will punish you.'



<P>The robber laughed:



<P>'I am not afraid of God, and I will not listen to you. You are not my

master,' said he. 'You live by your piety, and I by my robbery.

<BR>We all must live. You may teach the old women who come to you, but

you have nothing to teach me. And because you have

<BR>reminded me of God, I will kill two more men tomorrow. I would kill

you, but I do not want to soil my hands just now. See that in

<BR>future you keep out of my way!'



<P>Having uttered this threat, the robber rode away. He did not come again,

and the godson lived in peace, as before, for eight more

<BR>years.



<P>XI



<P>One night the godson watered his stumps, and, after returning to his

cell, he sat down to rest, and watched the footpath, wondering

<BR>if some one would soon come. But no one came at all that day. He sat

alone till evening, feeling lonely and dull, and he thought

<BR>about his past life. Ho remembered how the robber had reproached him

for living by his piety; and he reflected on his way of life.

<BR>'I am not living as the hermit commanded me to,' thought he. 'The hermit

laid a penance upon me, and I have made both a living

<BR>and fame out of it; and have been so tempted by it, that now I feel

dull when people do not come to me; and when they do come, I

<BR>only rejoice because they praise my holiness. That is not how one should

live. I have been led astray by love of praise. I have not

<BR>atoned for my past sins, but have added fresh ones. I will go to another

part of the forest where people will not find me; and I will

<BR>live so as to atone for my old sins and commit no fresh ones.'



<P>Having come to this conclusion the godson filled a bag with dried bread

and, taking a spade, left the cell and started for a ravine he

<BR>knew of in a lonely spot, where he could dig himself a cave and hide

from the people.



<P>As he was going along with his bag and his spade he saw the robber riding

towards him. The godson was frightened, and started

<BR>to run away, but the robber overtook him.



<P>'Where are you going?' asked the robber.



<P>The godson told him he wished to get away from the people and live somewhere

where no one would come to him. This surprised

<BR>the robber.



<P>'What will you live on, if people do not come to see you?' asked he.



<P>The godson had not even thought of this, but the robber's question reminded

him that food would be necessary.



<P>'On what God pleases to give me,' he replied.



<P>The robber said nothing, and rode away.



<P>'Why did I not say anything to him about his way of life?' thought the

godson. 'He might repent now. To-day he seems in a gentler

<BR>mood, and has not threatened to kill me.' And he shouted to the robber:



<P>'You have still to repent of your sins. You cannot escape from God.'



<P>The robber turned his horse, and drawing a knife from his girdle threatened

the hermit with it. The latter was alarmed, and ran

<BR>away further into the forest.



<P>The robber did not follow him, but only shouted:



<P>'Twice I have let you off, old man, but next time you come in my way

I will kill you!'



<P>Having said this, he rode away. In the evening when the godson went

to water his stumps -- one of them was sprouting! A little

<BR>apple tree was growing out of it.



<P>XII



<P>After hiding himself from everybody, the godson lived all alone. When

his supply of bread was exhausted, he thought: 'Now I must

<BR>go and look for some roots to eat.' He had not gone far, however, before

he saw a bag of dried bread hanging on a branch. He

<BR>took it down, and as long as it lasted he lived upon that.



<P>When he had eaten it all, he found another bagful on the same branch.

So he lived on, his only trouble being his fear of the robber.

<BR>Whenever he heard the robber passing he hid thinking:



<P>'He may kill me before I have had time to atone for my sins.'



<P>In this way he lived for ten more years. The one apple-tree continued

to grow, but the other two stumps remained exactly as they

<BR>were.



<P>One morning the godson rose early and went to his work. By the time

he had thoroughly moistened the ground round the stumps,

<BR>he was tired out and sat down to rest. As he sat there he thought to

himself:



<P>'I have sinned, and have become afraid of death. It may be God's will

that I should redeem my sins by death.'



<P>Hardly had this thought crossed his mind when he heard the robber riding

up, swearing at something. When the godson heard this,

<BR>he thought:



<P>'No evil and no good can befall me from any one but from God.'



<P>And he went to meet the robber. He saw the robber was not alone, but

behind him on the saddle sat another man, gagged, and

<BR>bound hand and foot. The man was doing nothing, but the robber was

abusing him violently. The godson went up and stood in front

<BR>of the horse.



<P>'Where are you taking this man?' he asked.



<P>'Into the forest,' replied the robber. 'He is a merchant's son, and

will not tell me where his father's money is hidden. I am going to

<BR>flog him till he tells me.'



<P>And the robber spurred on his horse, but the godson caught hold of his

bridle, and would not let him pass.



<P>'Let this man go!' he said.



<P>The robber grew angry, and raised his arm to strike.



<P>'Would you like a taste of what I am going to give this man? Have I

not promised to kill you? Let go!'



<P>The godson was not afraid.



<P>'You shall not go,' said he. 'I do not fear you. I fear no one but God,

and He wills that I should not let you pass. Set this man free!'



<P>The robber frowned, and snatching out his knife, cut the ropes with

which the merchant's son was bound, and set him free.



<P>'Get away both of you,' he said, 'and beware hour you cross my path

again.'



<P>The merchant's son jumped down and ran away. The robber was about to

ride on, but the godson stopped him again, and again

<BR>spoke to him about giving up his evil life. The robber heard him to

the end in silence, and then rode away without a word.



<P>The next morning the godson went to water his stumps and lo! the second

stump was sprouting. A second young apple-tree had

<BR>begun to grow.



<P>XIII



<P>Another ten years had gone by. The godson was sitting quietly one day,

desiring nothing, fearing nothing, and with a heart full of

<BR>joy.



<P>'What blessings God showers on men!' thought he. 'Yet how needlessly

they torment themselves. What prevents them from living

<BR>happily?'



<P>And remembering all the evil in men, and the troubles they bring upon

themselves, his heart filled with pity.



<P>'It is wrong of me to live as I do,' he said to himself. 'I must go

and teach others what I have myself learnt.'



<P>Hardly had he thought this, when he heard the robber approaching. He

let him pass, thinking:



<P>'It is no good talking to him, he will not understand.'



<P>That was his first thought, but ho changed his mind and went out into

the road. He saw that the robber was gloomy, and was riding

<BR>with downcast eyes. The godson looked at him, pitied him, and running

up to him laid his hand upon his knee.



<P>'Brother, dear,' said he, 'have some pity on your own soul! In you lives

the spirit of God. You suffer, and torment others, and lay up

<BR>more and more suffering for the future. Yet God loves you, and has

prepared such blessings for you. Do not ruin yourself utterly.

<BR>Change your life!'



<P>The robber frowned and turned away.



<P>'Leave me alone!' said he.



<P>But the godson held the robber still faster, and began to weep.



<P>Then the robber lifted his eyes and looked at the godson. He looked

at him for a long time, and alighting from his horse, fell on his

<BR>knees at the godson's feet.



<P>'You have overcome me, old man,' said he. 'For twenty years I have resisted

you, but now you have conquered me. Do what you

<BR>will with me, for I have no more power over myself. When you first

tried to persuade me, it only angered me more. Only when

<BR>you hid yourself from men did I begin to consider your words: for I

saw then that you asked nothing of them for yourself. Since

<BR>that day I have brought food for you, hanging it upon the tree.'



<P>Then the godson remembered that the woman got her table clean only after

she had rinsed her cloth. In the same way, it was only

<BR>when he ceased caring about himself, and cleansed his own heart, that

he was able to cleanse the hearts of others.



<P>The robber went on.



<P>'When I saw that you did not fear death, my heart turned.'



<P>Then the godson remembered that the wheel-wrights could not bend the

rims until they had fixed their block. So, not till he had

<BR>cast away the fear of death and made his life fast in God, could he

subdue this man's unruly heart.



<P>'But my heart did not quite melt,' continued the robber, 'until you

pitied me and wept for me.'



<P>The godson, full of joy, led the robber to the place where the stumps

were. And when they got there, they saw that from the third

<BR>stump an apple-tree had begun to sprout. And the godson remembered

that the drovers had not been able to light the damp wood

<BR>until the fire had burnt up well. So it was only when his own heart

burnt warmly, that another's heart had been kindled by it.



<P>And the godson was full of joy that he had at last atoned for his sins.



<P>He told all this to the robber, and died. The robber buried him, and

lived as the godson had commanded him, teaching to others

<BR>what the godson had taught him.

<P>'Then came Peter, and said to him, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin

against me, and I forgive him? until seven times? Jesus

<BR>saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until

seventy times seven. Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened

<BR>unto a certain king, which would make a reckoning with his servants.

And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto

<BR>him, which owed him ten thousand talents. But forasmuch as he had not

wherewith to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold,

<BR>and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be

made. The servant therefore fell down and worshipped him,

<BR>saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And the

lord of that servant, being moved with compassion,

<BR>released him, and forgave him the debt. But that servant went out,

and found one of his fellow-servants, which owed him a

<BR>hundred pence: and he laid hold on him, and took him by the throat

saying, Pay what thou owest. So his fellow-servant fell

<BR>down and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay

thee. And he would not: but went and cast him into

<BR>prison, till he should pay that which was due. So when his fellow-servants

saw what was done, they were exceeding sorry, and

<BR>came and told unto their lord all that was done. Then his lord called

him unto him, and saith to him, Thou wicked servant, I

<BR>forgave thee all that debt, because thou besoughtest me: shouldest

not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant, even as

<BR>I had mercy on thee? And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the

tormentors, till he should pay all that was due. So shall

<BR>also my heavenly Father do unto you, if ye forgive not every one his

brother from your hearts.' -- Matt. xviii. 21-35.



<P>THERE once lived in a village a peasant named Iv&aacute;n Stcherbak&oacute;f.

He was comfortably off, in the prime of life, the best worker

<BR>in the village, and had three sons all able to work. The eldest was

married, the second about to marry, and the third was a big

<BR>lad who could mind the horses and was already beginning to plough.

Ivan's wife was an able and thrifty woman, and they were

<BR>fortunate in having a quiet, hard-working daughter-in-law. There was

nothing to prevent Iv&aacute;n and his family from living happily.

<BR>They had only one idle mouth to feed; that was Iv&aacute;n's old father,

who suffered from asthma and had been lying ill on the top of

<BR>the brick oven for seven years. Iv&aacute;n had all he needed: three

horses and a colt, a cow with a calf, and fifteen sheep. The

<BR>women made all the clothing for the family, besides helping in the

fields, and the men tilled the land. They always had grain

<BR>enough of their own to last over beyond the next harvest and sold enough

oats to pay the taxes and meet their other needs. So

<BR>Iv&aacute;n and his children might have lived quite comfortably had

it not been for a feud between him and his next-door neighbour,

<BR>Limping Gabriel, the son of Gord&eacute;y Iv&aacute;nof.



<P>As long as old Gord&eacute;y was alive and Iv&aacute;n's father was

still able to manage the household, the peasants lived as neighbours

<BR>should. If the women of either house happened to want a sieve or a

tub, or the men required a sack, or if a cart-wheel got

<BR>broken and could not be mended at once, they used to send to the other

house, and helped each other in neighbourly fashion.

<BR>When a calf strayed into the neighbour's thrashing-ground they would

just drive it out, and only say, 'Don't let it get in again; our

<BR>grain is lying there.' And such things as locking up the barns and

outhouses, hiding things from one another, or backbiting were

<BR>never thought of in those days.



<P>That was in the fathers' time. When the sons came to be at the head

of the families, everything changed.



<P>It all began about a trifle.



<P>Iv&aacute;n's daughter-in-law had a hen that began laying rather early

in the season, and she started collecting its eggs for Easter.

<BR>Every day she went to the cart-shed, and found an egg in the cart;

but one day the hen, probably frightened by the children,

<BR>flew across the fence into the neighbour's yard and laid its egg there.

The woman heard the cackling, but said to herself: 'I have

<BR>no time now; I must tidy up for Sunday. I'll fetch the egg later on.'

In the evening she went to the cart, but found no egg there.

<BR>She went and asked her mother-in-law and brother-in-law whether they

had taken the egg. 'No,' they had not; but her

<BR>youngest brother-in-law, Tar&aacute;s, said: 'Your Biddy laid its egg

in the neighbour's yard. It was there she was cackling, and she

<BR>flew back across the fence from there.'



<P>The woman went and looked at the hen. There she was on the perch with

the other birds, her eyes just closing ready to go to

<BR>sleep. The woman wished she could have asked the hen and got an answer

from her.



<P>Then she went to the neighbour's, and Gabriel's mother came out to meet

her.



<P>'What do you want, young woman?'



<P>'Why, Granny, you see, my hen flew across this morning. Did she not

lay an egg here?'



<P>'We never saw anything of it. The Lord be thanked, our own hens started

laying long ago. We collect our own eggs and have

<BR>no need of other people's! And we don't go looking for eggs in other

people's yards, lass!'



<P>The young woman was offended, and said more than she should have done.

Her neighbour answered back with interest, and

<BR>the women began abusing each other. Ivan's wife, who had been to fetch

water, happening to pass just then, joined in too.

<BR>Gabriel's wife rushed out, and began reproaching the young woman with

things that had really happened and with other things

<BR>that never had happened at all. Then a general uproar commenced, all

shouting at once, trying to get out two words at a time,

<BR>and not choice words either.



<P>'You're this!' and 'You're that!' 'You're a thief!' and 'You're a slut!'

and 'You're starving your old father-in-law to death!' and

<BR>'You're a good-for-nothing!' and so on.



<P>'And you've made a hole in the sieve I lent you, you jade! And it's

our yoke you're carrying your pails on -- you just give back

<BR>our yoke!'



<P>Then they caught hold of the yoke, and spilt the water, snatched off

one another's shawls, and began fighting. Gabriel, returning

<BR>from the fields, stopped to take his wife's part. Out rushed Iv&aacute;n

and his son and joined in with the rest. Iv&aacute;n was a strong

<BR>fellow, he scattered the whole lot of them, and pulled a handful of

hair out of Gabriel's beard. People came to see what was the

<BR>matter, and the fighters were separated with difficulty.



<P>That was how it all began.



<P>Gabriel wrapped the hair torn from his beard in a paper, and went to

the District Court to have the law of Iv&aacute;n. 'I didn't grow

<BR>my beard,' said he, 'for pockmarked Iv&aacute;n to pull it out!' And

his wife went bragging to the neighbours, saying they'd have Iv&aacute;n

<BR>condemned and sent to Siberia. And so the feud grew.



<P>The old man, from where he lay on the top of the oven, tried from the

very first to persuade them to make peace, but they

<BR>would not listen. He told them, 'It's a stupid thing you are after,

children, picking quarrels about such a paltry matter. Just think!

<BR>The whole thing began about an egg. The children may have taken it

-- well, what matter? What's the value of one egg? God

<BR>sends enough for all! And suppose your neighbour did say an unkind

word -- put it right; show her how to say a better one! If

<BR>there has been a fight -- well, such things will happen; we're all

sinners, but make it up, and let there be an end of it! If you

<BR>nurse your anger it will be worse for you yourselves.'



<P>But the younger folk would not listen to the old man. They thought his

words were mere senseless dotage. Iv&aacute;n would not

<BR>humble himself before his neighbour.



<P>'I never pulled his beard,' he said, 'he pulled the hair out himself.

But his son has burst all the fastenings on my shirt, and torn it. .

<BR>. . Look at it!'



<P>And Iv&aacute;n also went to law. They were tried by the Justice of

the Peace and by the District Court. While all this was going on,

<BR>the coupling-pin of Gabriel's cart disappeared. Gabriel's womenfolk

accused Ivan's son of having taken it. They said: 'We saw

<BR>him in the night go past our window, towards the cart; and a neighbour

says he saw him at the pub, offering the pin to the

<BR>landlord.'



<P>So they went to law about that. And at home not a day passed without

a quarrel or even a fight. The children, too, abused one

<BR>another, having learnt to do so from their elders; and when the women

happened to meet by the river-side, where they went to

<BR>rinse the clothes, their arms did not do as much wringing as their

tongues did nagging, and every word was a bad one.



<P>At first the peasants only slandered one another; but afterwards they

began in real earnest to snatch anything that lay handy, and

<BR>the children followed their example. Life became harder and harder

for them. Iv&aacute;n Stcherbak&oacute;f and Limping Gabriel kept suing

<BR>one another at the Village Assembly, and at the District Court, and

before the Justice of the Peace until all the judges were tired

<BR>of them. Now Gabriel got Iv&aacute;n fined or imprisoned; then Iv&aacute;n

did as much to Gabriel; and the more they spited each other the

<BR>angrier they grew -- like dogs that attack one another and get more

and more furious the longer they fight. You strike one dog

<BR>from behind, and it thinks it's the other dog biting him, and gets

still fiercer. So these peasants: they went to law, and one or

<BR>other of them was fined or locked up, but that only made them more

and more angry with each other. 'Wait a bit,' they said,

<BR>'and I'll make you pay for it.' And so it went on for six years. Only

the old man lying on the top of the oven kept telling them

<BR>again and again: 'Children, what are you doing? Stop all this paying

back; keep to your work, and don't bear malice -- it will be

<BR>better for you. The more you bear malice, the worse it will be.'



<P>But they would not listen to him.



<P>In the seventh year, at a wedding, Ivan's daughter-in-law held Gabriel

up to shame, accusing him of having been caught

<BR>horse-stealing. Gabriel was tipsy, and unable to contain his anger,

gave the woman such a blow that she was laid up for a

<BR>week; and she was pregnant at the time. Iv&aacute;n was delighted.

He went to the magistrate to lodge a complaint. 'Now I'll get rid of

<BR>my neighbour! He won't escape imprisonment, or exile to Siberia.' But

Ivan's wish was not fulfilled. The magistrate dismissed

<BR>the case. The woman was examined, but she was up and about and showed

no sign of any injury. Then Ivan went to the Justice

<BR>of the Peace, but he referred the business to the District Court. Ivan

bestirred himself: treated the clerk and the Elder of the

<BR>District Court to a gallon of liquor and got Gabriel condemned to be

flogged. The sentence was read out to Gabriel by the

<BR>clerk: 'The Court decrees that the peasant Gabriel Gord&eacute;yef

shall receive twenty lashes with a birch rod at the District Court.'



<P>Ivan too heard the sentence read, and looked at Gabriel to see how he

would take it. Gabriel grew as pale as a sheet, and

<BR>turned round and went out into the passage. Ivan followed him, meaning

to see to the horse, and he overheard Gabriel say,

<BR>'Very well! He will have my back flogged: that will make it burn; but

something of his may burn worse than that!'



<P>Hearing these words, Ivan at once went back into the Court, and said:

'Upright judges! He threatens to set my house on fire!

<BR>Listen: he said it in the presence of witnesses!'



<P>Gabriel was recalled. 'Is it true that you said this?'



<P>'I haven't said anything. Flog me, since you have the power. It seems

that I alone am to suffer, and all for being in the right,

<BR>while he is allowed to do as he likes.'



<P>Gabriel wished to say something more, but his lips and his cheeks quivered,

and he turned towards the wall. Even the officials

<BR>were frightened by his looks. 'He may do some mischief to himself or

to his neighbour,' thought they.



<P>Then the old Judge said: 'Look here, my men; you'd better be reasonable

and make it up. Was it right of you, friend Gabriel, to

<BR>strike a pregnant woman? It was lucky it passed off so well, but think

what might have happened! Was it right? You had better

<BR>confess and beg his pardon, and he will forgive you, and we will alter

the sentence.'



<P>The clerk heard these words, and remarked: 'That's impossible under

Statute 117. An agreement between the parties not

<BR>having been arrived at, a decision of the Court has been pronounced

and must be executed.'



<P>But the Judge would not listen to the clerk.



<P>'Keep your tongue still, my friend,' said he. 'The first of all laws

is to obey God, Who loves peace.' And the Judge began again

<BR>to persuade the peasants, but could not succeed. Gabriel would not

listen to him.



<P>'I shall be fifty next year,' said he, 'and have a married son, and

have never been flogged in my life, and now that pockmarked

<BR>Ivan has had me condemned to be flogged, and am I to go and ask his

forgiveness? No; I've borne enough. . . . Ivan shall have

<BR>cause to remember me!'



<P>Again Gabriel's voice quivered, and he could say no more, but turned

round and went out.



<P>It was seven miles from the Court to the village, and it was getting

late when Ivan reached home. He unharnessed his horse, put

<BR>it up for the night, and entered the cottage. No one was there. The

women had already gone to drive the cattle in, and the

<BR>young fellows were not yet back from the fields. Iv&aacute;n went in,

and sat down, thinking. He remembered how Gabriel had

<BR>listened to the sentence, and how pale he had become, and how he had

turned to the wall; and Ivan's heart grew heavy. He

<BR>thought how he himself would feel if he were sentenced, and he pitied

Gabriel. Then he heard his old father up on the oven

<BR>cough, and saw him sit up, lower his legs, and scramble down. The old

man dragged himself slowly to a seat, and sat down. He

<BR>was quite tired out with the exertion, and coughed a long time till

he had cleared his throat. Then, leaning against the table, he

<BR>said: 'Well, has he been condemned?'



<P>'Yes, to twenty strokes with the rods,' answered Iv&aacute;n.



<P>The old man shook his head.



<P>'A bad business,' said he. 'You are doing wrong, Iv&aacute;n! Ah! it's

very bad -- not for him so much as for yourself! . . . Well, they'll

<BR>flog him: but will that do you any good?'



<P>'He'll not do it again,' said Iv&aacute;n.



<P>'What is it he'll not do again? What has he done worse than you?'



<P>'Why, think of the harm he has done me!' said Iv&aacute;n. 'He nearly

killed my wife, and now he's threatening to burn us up. Am I to

<BR>thank him for it?'



<P>The old man sighed, and said: 'You go about the wide world, Iv&aacute;n,

while I am lying on the oven all these years, so you think

<BR>you see everything, and that I see nothing. . . . Ah, lad! It's you

that don't see; malice blinds you. Others' sins are before your

<BR>eyes, but your own are behind your back. "He's acted badly!" What a

thing to say! If he were the only one to act badly, how

<BR>could strife exist? Is strife among men ever bred by one alone? Strife

is always between two. His badness you see, but your

<BR>own you don't. If he were bad, but you were good, there would be no

strife. Who pulled the hair out of his beard? Who spoilt

<BR>his haystack? Who dragged him to the law court? Yet you put it all

on him! You live a bad life yourself, that's what is wrong!

<BR>It's not the way I used to live, lad, and it's not the way I taught

you. Is that the way his old father and I used to live? How did

<BR>we live? Why, as neighbours should! If he happened to run out of flour,

one of the women would come across: "Uncle Trol, we

<BR>want some flour." "Go to the barn, dear," I'd say: "take what you need."

If he'd no one to take his horses to pasture, "Go, Iv&aacute;n,"

<BR>I'd say, "and look after his horses." And if I was short of anything,

I'd go to him. "Uncle Gord&eacute;y," I'd say, "I want so-and-so!"

<BR>"Take it Uncle Trol!" That's how it was between us, and we had an easy

time of it. But now? . . . That soldier the other day

<BR>was telling us about the fight at Plevna[9]. Why, there's war between

you worse than at Plevna! Is that living? . . . What a sin it

<BR>is! You are a man and master of the house; it's you who will have to

answer. What are you teaching the women and the

<BR>children? To snarl and snap? Why, the other day your Tar&aacute;ska

-- that greenhorn -- was swearing at neighbour Irena, calling her

<BR>names; and his mother listened and laughed. Is that right? It is you

will have to answer. Think of your soul. Is this all as it should

<BR>be? You throw a word at me, and I give you two in return; you give

me a blow, and I give you two. No, lad! Christ, when He

<BR>walked on earth, taught us fools something very different. . . . If

you get a hard word from any one, keep silent, and his own

<BR>conscience will accuse him. That is what our Lord taught. If you get

a slap, turn the other cheek. "Here, beat me, if that's what I

<BR>deserve!" And his own conscience will rebuke him. He will soften, and

will listen to you. That's the way He taught us, not to be

<BR>proud! . . . Why don't you speak? Isn't it as I say?'



<P>Iv&aacute;n sat silent and listened.



<P>The old man coughed, and having with difficulty cleared his throat,

began again: 'You think Christ taught us wrong? Why, it's all

<BR>for our own good. Just think of your earthly life; are you better off,

or worse, since this Plevna began among you? Just reckon

<BR>up what you've spent on all this law business -- what the driving backwards

and forwards and your food on the way have cost

<BR>you! What fine fellows your sons have grown; you might live and get

on well; but now your means are lessening. And why? All

<BR>because of this folly; because of your pride. You ought to be ploughing

with your lads, and do the sowing yourself; but the fiend

<BR>carries you off to the judge, or to some pettifogger or other. The

ploughing is not done in time, nor the sowing, and mother

<BR>earth can't bear properly. Why did the oats fail this year? When did

you sow them? When you came back from town! And

<BR>what did you gain? A burden for your own shoulders. . . . Eh, lad,

think of your own business! Work with your boys in the field

<BR>and at home, and if some one offends you, forgive him, as God wished

you to. Then life will be easy, and your heart will always

<BR>be light.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n remained silent.



<P>'Iv&aacute;n, my boy, hear your old father! Go and harness the roan,

and go at once to the Government office; put an end to all this

<BR>affair there; and in the morning go and make it up with Gabriel in

God's name, and invite him to your house for to-morrow's

<BR>holiday' (it was the eve of the Virgin's Nativity). 'Have tea ready,

and get a bottle of v&oacute;dka and put an end to this wicked

<BR>business, so that there should not be any more of it in future, and

tell the women and children to do the same.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n sighed, and thought, 'What he says is true,' and his heart

grew lighter. Only he did not know how, now, to begin to put

<BR>matters right.



<P>But again the old man began, as if he had guessed what was in Ivan's

mind.



<P>'Go, Iv&aacute;n, don't put it off! Put out the fire before it spreads,

or it will be too late.'



<P>The old man was going to say more, but before he could do so the women

came in, chattering like magpies. The news that

<BR>Gabriel was sentenced to be flogged, and of his threat to set fire

to the house, had already reached them. They had heard all

<BR>about it and added to it something of their own, and had again had

a row, in the pasture, with the women of Gabriel's

<BR>household. They began telling how Gabriel's daughter-in-law threatened

a fresh action: Gabriel had got the right side of the

<BR>examining magistrate, who would now turn the whole affair upside down;

and the schoolmaster was writing out another petition,

<BR>to the Tsar himself this time, about Iv&aacute;n; and everything was

in the petition -- all about the coupling-pin and the kitchen-garden

<BR>-- so that half of Ivan's homestead would be theirs soon. Iv&aacute;n

heard what they were saying, and his heart grew cold again, and

<BR>he gave up the thought of making peace with Gabriel.



<P>In a farmstead there is always plenty for the master to do. Iv&aacute;n

did not stop to talk to the women, but went out to the

<BR>threshing-floor and to the barn. By the time he had tidied up there,

the sun had set and the young fellows had returned from the

<BR>field. They had been ploughing the field for the winter crops with

two horses. Iv&aacute;n met them, questioned them about their work,

<BR>helped to put everything in its place, set a torn horse-collar aside

to be mended, and was going to put away some stakes under

<BR>the barn, but it had grown quite dusk, so he decided to leave them

where they were till next day. Then he gave the cattle their

<BR>food, opened the gate, let out the horses. Tar&aacute;s was to take

to pasture for the night, and again closed the gate and barred it.

<BR>'Now,' thought he, 'I'll have my supper, and then to bed.' He took

the horse-collar and entered the hut. By this time he had

<BR>forgotten about Gabriel and about what his old father had been saying

to him. But, just as he took hold of the door-handle to

<BR>enter the passage, he heard his neighbour on the other side of the

fence cursing somebody in a hoarse voice: 'What the devil is

<BR>he good for?' Gabriel was saying. 'He's only fit to be killed!' At

these words all Ivan's former bitterness towards his neighbour

<BR>re-awoke. He stood listening while Gabriel scolded, and, when he stopped,

Iv&aacute;n went into the hut.



<P>There was a light inside; his daughter-in-law sat spinning, his wife

was getting supper ready, his eldest son was making straps

<BR>for bark shoes, his second sat near the table with a book, and Tar&aacute;s

was getting ready to go out to pasture the horses for the

<BR>night. Everything in the hut would have been pleasant and bright, but

for that plague -- a bad neighbour!



<P>Iv&aacute;n entered, sullen and cross; threw the cat down from the bench,

and scolded the women for putting the slop-pail in the

<BR>wrong place. He felt despondent, and sat down, frowning, to mend the

horse-collar. Gabriel's words kept ringing in his ears: his

<BR>threat at the law court, and what he had just been shouting in a hoarse

voice about some one who was 'only fit to be killed.'



<P>His wife gave Tar&aacute;s his supper, and, having eaten it, Tar&aacute;s

put on an old sheepskin and another coat, tied a sash round his

<BR>waist, took some bread with him, and went out to the horses. His eldest

brother was going to see him off, but Iv&aacute;n himself rose

<BR>instead, and went out into the porch. It had grown quite dark outside,

clouds had gathered, and the wind had risen. Iv&aacute;n went

<BR>down the steps, helped his boy to mount, started the foal after him,

and stood listening while Tar&aacute;s rode down the village and

<BR>was there joined by other lads with their horses. Iv&aacute;n waited

until they were all out of hearing. As he stood there by the gate he

<BR>could not get Gabriel's words out of his head: 'Mind that something

of yours does not burn worse!'



<P>'He is desperate,' thought Iv&aacute;n. 'Everything is dry, and it's

windy weather besides. He'll come up at the back somewhere, set

<BR>fire to something, and be off. He'll burn the place and escape scot

free, the villain! . . . There now, if one could but catch him in

<BR>the act, he'd not get off then!' And the thought fixed itself so firmly

in his mind that he did not go up the steps but went out into

<BR>the street and round the corner. I'll just walk round the buildings;

who can tell what he's after?' And Iv&aacute;n, stepping softly,

<BR>passed out of the gate. As soon as he reached the corner, he looked

round along the fence, and seemed to see something

<BR>suddenly move at the opposite corner, as if some one had come out and

disappeared again. Iv&aacute;n stopped, and stood quietly,

<BR>listening and looking. Everything was still; only the leaves of the

willows fluttered in the wind, and the straws of the thatch

<BR>rustled. At first it seemed pitch dark, but, when his eyes had grown

used to the darkness, he could see the far corner, and a

<BR>plough that lay there, and the eaves. He looked a while, but saw no

one.



<P>'I suppose it was a mistake,' thought Iv&aacute;n; 'but still I will

go round,' and Iv&aacute;n went stealthily along by the shed. Iv&aacute;n

stepped so

<BR>softly in his bark shoes that he did not hear his own footsteps. As

he reached the far corner, something seemed to flare up for a

<BR>moment near the plough and to vanish again. Iv&aacute;n felt as if

struck to the heart; and he stopped. Hardly had he stopped, when

<BR>something flared up more brightly in the same place, and he clearly

saw a man with a cap on his head, crouching down, with his

<BR>back towards him, lighting a bunch of straw he held in his hand. Iv&aacute;n's

heart fluttered within him like a bird. Straining every

<BR>nerve, he approached with great strides, hardly feeling his legs under

him. 'Ah,' thought Iv&aacute;n, 'now he won't escape! I'll catch

<BR>him in the act!'



<P>Iv&aacute;n was still some distance off, when suddenly he saw a bright

light, but not in the same place as before, and not a small flame.

<BR>The thatch had flared up at the eaves, the flames were reaching up

to the roof, and, standing beneath it, Gabriel's whole figure

<BR>was clearly visible.



<P>Like a hawk swooping down on a lark, Iv&aacute;n rushed at Limping Gabriel.

'Now I'll have him; he shan't escape me!' thought Iv&aacute;n.

<BR>But Gabriel must have heard his steps, and (however he managed it)

glancing round, he scuttled away past the barn like a hare.



<P>'You shan't escape!' shouted Iv&aacute;n, darting after him.



<P>Just as he was going to seize Gabriel, the latter dodged him; but Iv&aacute;n

managed to catch the skirt of Gabriel's coat. It tore right

<BR>off, and Iv&aacute;n fell down. He recovered his feet, and shouting,

'Help! Seize him! Thieves! Murder!' ran on again. But meanwhile

<BR>Gabriel had reached his own gate. There Iv&aacute;n overtook him and

was about to seize him, when something struck Iv&aacute;n a stunning

<BR>blow, as though a stone had hit his temple, quite deafening him. It

was Gabriel who, seizing an oak wedge that lay near the gate,

<BR>had struck out with all his might.



<P>Iv&aacute;n was stunned; sparks flew before his eyes, then all grew

dark and he staggered. When he came to his senses Gabriel was

<BR>no longer there: it was as light as day, and from the side where his

homestead was something roared and crackled like an

<BR>engine at work. Iv&aacute;n turned round and saw that his back shed

was all ablaze, and the side shed had also caught fire, and flames

<BR>and smoke and bits of burning straw mixed with the smoke, were being

driven towards his hut.



<P>'What is this, friends? . . .' cried Iv&aacute;n, lifting his arms and

striking his thighs.' Why, all I had to do was just to snatch it out from

<BR>under the eaves and trample on it! What is this, friends? . . .' he

kept repeating. He wished to shout, but his breath failed him;

<BR>his voice was gone. He wanted to run, but his legs would not obey him,

and got in each other's way. He moved slowly, but

<BR>again staggered and again his breath failed. He stood still till he

had regained breath, and then went on. Before he had got round

<BR>the back shed to reach the fire, the side shed was also all ablaze;

and the corner of the hut and the covered gateway had caught

<BR>fire as well. The flames were leaping out of the hut, and it was impossible

to get into the yard. A large crowd had collected, but

<BR>nothing could be done. The neighbours were carrying their belongings

out of their own houses, and driving the cattle out of their

<BR>own sheds. After Ivan's house, Gabriel's also caught fire, then, the

wind rising, the flames spread to the other side of the street

<BR>and half the village was burnt down.



<P>At Ivan's house they barely managed to save his old father; and the

family escaped in what they had on; everything else, except

<BR>the horses that had been driven out to pasture for the night, was lost;

all the cattle, the fowls on their perches, the carts, ploughs,

<BR>and harrows, the women's trunks with their clothes, and the grain in

the granaries -- all were burnt up!



<P>At Gabriel's, the cattle were driven out, and a few things saved from

his house.



<P>The fire lasted all night. Iv&aacute;n stood in front of his homestead

and kept repeating, 'What is this? . . . Friends! . . . One need only

<BR>have pulled it out and trampled on it!' But when the roof fell in,

Iv&aacute;n rushed into the burning place, and seizing a charred beam,

<BR>tried to drag it out. The women saw him, and called him back; but he

pulled out the beam, and was going in again for another

<BR>when he lost his footing and fell among the flames. Then his son made

his way in after him and dragged him out. Iv&aacute;n had singed

<BR>his hair and beard and burnt his clothes and scorched his hands, but

he felt nothing. 'His grief has stupefied him,' said the

<BR>people. The fire was burning itself out, but Iv&aacute;n still stood

repeating: 'Friends! . . . What is this? . . . One need only have pulled

<BR>it out!'



<P>In the morning the village Elder's son came to fetch Iv&aacute;n.



<P>'Daddy Iv&aacute;n, your father is dying! He has sent for you to say

good-bye.'



<P>Iv&aacute;n had forgotten about his father, and did not understand what

was being said to him.



<P>'What father?' he said. 'Whom has he sent for?'



<P>'He sent for you, to say good-bye; he is dying in our cottage! Come

along, daddy Iv&aacute;n,' said the Elder's son, pulling him by the

<BR>arm; and Iv&aacute;n followed the lad.



<P>When he was being carried out of the hut, some burning straw had fallen

on to the old man and burnt him, and he had been

<BR>taken to the village Elder's in the farther part of the village, which

the fire did not reach.



<P>When Iv&aacute;n came to his father, there was only the Elder's wife

in the hut, besides some little children on the top of the oven. All

<BR>the rest were still at the fire. The old man, who was lying on a bench

holding a wax candle[10] in his hand, kept turning his eyes

<BR>towards the door. When his son entered, he moved a little. The old

woman went up to him and told him that his son had come.

<BR>He asked to have him brought nearer. Iv&aacute;n came closer.



<P>'What did I tell you, Iv&aacute;n?' began the old man 'Who has burnt

down the village?'



<P>'It was he, father!' Iv&aacute;n answered. 'I caught him in the act.

I saw him shove the firebrand into the thatch. I might have pulled

<BR>away the burning straw and stamped it out, and then nothing would have

happened.'



<P>'Iv&aacute;n,' said the old man, 'I am dying, and you in your turn will

have to face death. Whose is the sin?'



<P>Iv&aacute;n gazed at his father in silence, unable to utter a word.



<P>'Now, before God, say whose is the sin? What did I tell you?'



<P>Only then Iv&aacute;n came to his senses and understood it all. He sniffed

and said, 'Mine, father!' And he fell on his knees before his

<BR>father, saying, 'Forgive me, father; I am guilty before you and before

God.'



<P>The old man moved his hands, changed the candle from his right hand

to his left, and tried to lift his right hand to his forehead to

<BR>cross himself, but could not do it, and stopped.



<P>'Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!' said he, and again he turned his

eyes towards his son.



<P>'Iv&aacute;n! I say, Iv&aacute;n!'



<P>'What, father?'



<P>'What must you do now?'



<P>Iv&aacute;n was weeping.



<P>'I don't know how we are to live now, father!' he said.



<P>The old man closed his eyes, moved his lips as if to gather strength,

and opening his eyes again, said: 'You'll manage. If you

<BR>obey God's will, you'll manage!' He paused, then smiled, and said:

'Mind, Iv&aacute;n! Don't tell who started the fire! Hide another

<BR>man's sin, and God will forgive two of yours!' And the old man took

the candle in both hands and, folding them on his breast,

<BR>sighed, stretched out, and died.



<P>Iv&aacute;n did not say anything against Gabriel, and no one knew what

had caused the fire.



<P>And Ivan's anger against Gabriel passed away, and Gabriel wondered that

Iv&aacute;n did not tell anybody. At first Gabriel felt afraid,

<BR>but after awhile he got used to it. The men left off quarrelling, and

then their families left off also. While rebuilding their huts,

<BR>both families lived in one house; and when the village was rebuilt

and they might have moved farther apart, Iv&aacute;n and Gabriel

<BR>built next to each other, and remained neighbours as before.



<P>They lived as good neighbours should. Iv&aacute;n Stcherbak&oacute;f

remembered his old father's command to obey God's law, and quench

<BR>a fire at the first spark; and if any one does him an injury he now

tries not to revenge himself, but rather to set matters right

<BR>again; and if any one gives him a bad word, instead of giving a worse

in return, he tries to teach the other not to use evil words;

<BR>and so he teaches his womenfolk and children. And Iv&aacute;n Stcherbak&oacute;f

has got on his feet again, and now lives better even than

<BR>he did before.

<BODY>

&nbsp;



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>A GRAIN AS BIG AS A HEN'S EGG</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>ONE day some children found, in a ravine, a thing shaped like a grain

of corn, with a groove down the middle, but as large as a

<BR>hen's egg. A traveller passing by saw the thing, bought it from the

children for a penny, and taking it to town sold it to the King as

<BR>a curiosity.



<P>The King called together his wise men, and told them to find out what

the thing was. The wise men pondered and pondered and

<BR>could not make head or tail of it, till one day, when the thing was

lying on a window-sill, a hen flew in and pecked at it till she made

<BR>a hole in it, and then every one saw that it was a grain of corn. The

wise men went to the King and said:



<P>'It is a grain of corn.'



<P>At this the King was much surprised; and he ordered the learned men

to find out when and where such corn had grown. The

<BR>learned men pondered again, and searched in their books, but could

find nothing about it. So they returned to the King and said:



<P>'We can give you no answer. There is nothing about it in our books.

You will have to ask the peasants; perhaps some of them may

<BR>have heard from their fathers when and where grain grew to such a size.'



<P>So the King gave orders that some very old peasant should be brought

before him; and his servants found such a man and brought

<BR>him to the King. Old and bent, ashy pale and toothless, he just managed

with the help of two crutches to totter into the King's

<BR>presence.



<P>The King showed him the grain, but the old man could hardly see it;

he took it, however, and felt it with his hands. The King

<BR>questioned him, saying:



<P>'Can you tell us, old man, where such grain as this grew? Have you ever

bought such corn, or sown such in your fields?'



<P>The old man was so deaf that he could hardly hear what the King said,

and only understood with great difficulty.



<P>'No!' he answered at last, 'I never sowed nor reaped any like it in

my fields, nor did I ever buy any such. When we bought corn,

<BR>the grains were always as small as they are now. But you might ask

my father. He may have heard where such grain grew.'



<P>So the King sent for the old man's father, and he was found and brought

before the King. He came walking with one crutch. The

<BR>King showed him the grain, and the old peasant, who was still able

to see, took a good look at it. And the King asked him:



<P>'Can you not tell us, old man, where corn like this used to grow? Have

you ever bought any like it, or sown any in your fields?'



<P>Though the old man was rather hard of hearing, he still heard better

than his son had done.



<P>'No,' he said, 'I never sowed nor reaped any grain like this in my field.

As to buying, I never bought any, for in my time money was

<BR>not yet in use. Every one grew his own corn, and when there was any

need we shared with one another. I do not know where

<BR>corn like this grew. Ours was larger and yielded more flour than present-day

grain, but I never saw any like this. I have, however,

<BR>heard my father say that in his time the grain grew larger and yielded

more flour than ours. You had better ask him.'



<P>So the King sent for this old man's father, and they found him too,

and brought him before the King. He entered walking easily and

<BR>without crutches: his eye was clear, his hearing good, and he spoke

distinctly. The King showed him the grain, and the old

<BR>grandfather looked at it, and turned it about in his hand.



<P>'It is long since I saw such a fine grain,' said he, and he bit a piece

off and tasted it.



<P>'It's the very same kind,' he added.



<P>'Tell me, grandfather,' said the King, 'when and where was such corn

grown? Have you ever bought any like it, or sown any in

<BR>your fields?'



<P>And the old man replied:



<P>'Corn like this used to grow everywhere in my time. I lived on corn

like this in my young days, and fed others on it. It was grain

<BR>like this that we used to sow and reap and thrash.'



<P>And the King asked:



<P>'Tell me, grandfather, did you buy it anywhere, or did you grow it all

yourself?'



<P>The old man smiled.



<P>'In my time,' he answered, 'no one ever thought of such a sin as buying

or selling bread; and we knew nothing of money. Each

<BR>man had corn enough of his own.'



<P>'Then tell me, grandfather,' asked the King, 'where was your field,

where did you grow corn like this?'



<P>And the grandfather answered:



<P>'My field was God's earth. Wherever I ploughed, there was my field.

Land was free. It was a thing no man called his own.

<BR>Labour was the only thing men called their own.'



<P>'Answer me two more questions,' said the King. 'The first is, Why did

the earth bear such grain then and has ceased to do so

<BR>now? And the second is, Why your grandson walks with two crutches,

your son with one, and you yourself with none? Your eyes

<BR>are bright, your teeth sound, and your speech clear and pleasant to

the ear. How have these things come about?'



<P>And the old man answered:



<P>'These things are so, because men have ceased to live by their own labour,

and have taken to depending on the labour of others. In

<BR>the old time, men lived according to God's law. They had what was their

own, and coveted not what others had produced.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>HOW MUCH LAND DOES A MAN NEED?</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>I



<P>AN elder sister came to visit her younger sister in the country. The

elder was married to a tradesman in town, the younger to a

<BR>peasant in the village. As the sisters sat over their tea talking,

the elder began to boast of the advantages of town life: saying how

<BR>comfortably they lived there, how well they dressed, what fine clothes

her children wore what good things they ate and drank, and

<BR>how she went to the theatre, promenades, and entertainments.



<P>The younger sister was piqued, and in turn disparage the life of a tradesman,

and stood up for that of a peasant.



<P>'I would not change my way of life for yours,' said she. We may live

roughly, but at least we are free from anxiety. You live in

<BR>better style than we do but though you often earn more than you need,

you are very likely to lose all you have. You know the

<BR>proverb, "Loss and gain are brothers twain." It often happens that

people who are wealthy one day are begging their bread the

<BR>next. Our way is safer. Though a peasant's life is not a fat one, it

is a long one. We shall never grow rich, but we shall always

<BR>have enough to eat.'



<P>The elder sister said sneeringly:



<P>'Enough? Yes, if you like to share with the pigs and the calves! What

do you know of elegance or manners! However much your

<BR>goodman may slave, you will die as you are living -- on a dung heap

-- and your children the same.'



<P>'Well, what of that?' replied the younger. 'Of course our work is rough

and coarse. But, on the other hand, it is sure; and we need

<BR>not bow to any one. But you, in your towns, are surrounded by temptations;

to-day all may be right, but to-morrow the Evil One

<BR>may tempt your husband with cards, wine, or women, and all will go

to ruin. Don't such things happen often enough?'



<P>Pah&oacute;m, the master of the house, was lying on the top of the oven,

and he listened to the women's chatter.



<P>'It is perfectly true,' thought he. 'Busy as we are from childhood tilling

mother earth, we peasants have no time to let any nonsense

<BR>settle in our heads. Our only trouble is that we haven't land enough.

If I had plenty of land, I shouldn't fear the Devil himself!'



<P>The women finished their tea, chatted a while about dress, and then

cleared away the tea-things and lay down to sleep.



<P>But the Devil had been sitting behind the oven, and had heard all that

was said. He was pleased that the peasant's wife had led her

<BR>husband into boasting, and that he had said that if he had plenty of

land he would not fear the Devil himself.



<P>'All right,' thought the Devil. 'We will have a tussle. I'll give you

land enough; and by means of that land I will get you into my

<BR>power.'



<P>II



<P>Close to the village there lived a lady, a small landowner, who had

an estate of about three hundred acres[19]. She had always

<BR>lived on good terms with the peasants, until she engaged as her steward

an old soldier, who took to burdening the people with

<BR>fines. However careful Pah&oacute;m tried to be, it happened again

and again that now a horse of his got among the lady's oats, now a

<BR>cow strayed into her garden, now his calves found their way into her

meadows -- and he always had to pay a fine.



<P>Pah&oacute;m paid up, but grumbled, and, going home in a temper, was

rough with his family. All through that summer, Pah&oacute;m had much

<BR>trouble because of this steward; and he was even glad when winter came

and the cattle had to be stabled. Though he grudged the

<BR>fodder when they could no longer graze on the pasture-land, at least

he was free from anxiety about them.



<P>In the winter the news got about that the lady was going to sell her

land, and that the keeper of the inn on the high road was

<BR>bargaining for it. When the peasants heard this they were very much

alarmed.



<P>'Well', thought they, 'if the innkeeper gets the land, he will worry

us with fines worse than the lady's steward. We all depend on

<BR>that estate.'



<P>So the peasants went on behalf of their Commune and asked the lady not

to sell the land to the innkeeper offering her a better

<BR>price for it themselves. The lady agreed to let them have it. Then

the peasants tried to arrange for the Commune to buy the whole

<BR>estate so that it might be held by them all in common. They met twice

to discuss it, but could not settle the matter; the Evil One

<BR>sowed discord among them, and they could not agree. So they decided

to buy the land individually, each according to his means;

<BR>and the lady agreed to this plan as she had to the other.



<P>Presently Pah&oacute;m heard that a neighbour of his was buying fifty

acres, and that the lady had consented to accept one half in cash

<BR>and to wait a year for the other half. Pah&oacute;m felt envious



<P>'Look at that,' thought he, 'the land is all being sold, and I shall

get none of it.' So he spoke to his wife.



<P>'Other people are buying,' said he, 'and we must also buy twenty acres

or so. Life is becoming impossible. That steward is simply

<BR>crushing us with his fines.'



<P>So they put their heads together and considered how they could manage

to buy it. They had one hundred roubles laid by. They sold

<BR>a colt, and one half of their bees; hired out one of their sons as

a labourer, and took his wages in advance; borrowed the rest from

<BR>a brother-in-law, and so scraped together half the purchase money.



<P>Having done this, Pah&oacute;m chose out a farm of forty acres, some

of it wooded, and went to the lady to bargain for it. They came to

<BR>an agreement, and he shook hands with her upon it, and paid her a deposit

in advance. Then they went to town and signed the

<BR>deeds; he paying half the price down, and undertaking to pay the remainder

within two years.



<P>So now Pah&oacute;m had land of his own. He borrowed seed, and sowed

it on the land he had bought. The harvest was a good one, and

<BR>within a year he had managed to pay off his debts both to the lady

and to his brother-in-law. So he became a landowner, ploughing

<BR>and sowing his own land, making hay on his own land, cutting his own

trees, and feeding his cattle on his own pasture. When he

<BR>went out to plough his fields, or to look at his growing corn, or at

his grass-meadows, his heart would fill with joy. The grass that

<BR>grew and the flowers that bloomed there, seemed to him unlike any that

grew elsewhere. Formerly, when he had passed by that

<BR>land it had appeared the same as any other land, but now it seemed

quite different.



<P>III



<P>So Pah&oacute;m was well-contented, and everything would have been right

if the neighbouring peasants would only not have trespassed

<BR>on his corn-fields and meadows. He appealed to them most civilly, but

they still went on: now the Communal herdsmen would let

<BR>the village cows stray into his meadows; then horses from the night

pasture would get among his corn. Pah&oacute;m turned them out

<BR>again and again, and forgave their owners, and for a long time he forbore

from prosecuting any one. But at last he lost patience

<BR>and complained to the District Court. He knew it was the peasants'

want of land, and no evil intent on their part, that caused the

<BR>trouble; but he thought:



<P>'I cannot go on overlooking it, or they will destroy all I have. They

must be taught a lesson.'



<P>So he had them up, gave them one lesson, and then another, and two or

three of the peasants were fined. After a time Pah&oacute;m's

<BR>neighbours began to bear him a grudge for this, and would now and then

let their cattle on to his land on purpose. One peasant

<BR>even got into Pah&oacute;m's wood at night and cut down five young

lime trees for their bark. Pah&oacute;m passing through the wood one day

<BR>noticed something white. He came nearer, and saw the stripped trunks

lying on the ground, and close by stood the stumps, where

<BR>the trees had been. Pah&oacute;m was furious.



<P>'If he had only cut one here and there it would have been bad enough,'

thought Pah&oacute;m, 'but the rascal has actually cut down a

<BR>whole clump. If I could only find out who did this, I would pay him

out.'



<P>He racked his brains as to who it could be. Finally he decided: 'It

must be Simon -- no one else could have done it.' So he went to

<BR>Simon's homestead to have a look round, but he found nothing, and only

had an angry scene. However, he now felt more certain

<BR>than ever that Simon had done it, and he lodged a complaint. Simon

was summoned. The case was tried, and re-tried, and at the

<BR>end of it all Simon was acquitted, there being no evidence against

him. Pah&oacute;m felt still more aggrieved, and let his anger loose

<BR>upon the Elder and the Judges.



<P>'You let thieves grease your palms,' said he. 'If you were honest folk

yourselves, you would not let a thief go free.'



<P>So Pah&oacute;m quarrelled with the Judges and with his neighbours.

Threats to burn his building began to be uttered. So though Pah&oacute;m

<BR>had more land, his place in the Commune was much worse than before.



<P>About this time a rumour got about that many people were moving to new

parts.



<P>'There's no need for me to leave my land,' thought Pah&oacute;m. 'But

some of the others might leave our village and then there would be

<BR>more room for us. I would take over their land myself, and make my

estate a bit bigger. I could then live more at ease. As it is, I

<BR>am still too cramped to be comfortable.



<P>One day Pah&oacute;m was sitting at home, when a peasant, passing through

the village, happened to call in. He was allowed to stay the

<BR>night, and supper was given him. Pah&oacute;m had a talk with this

peasant and asked him where he came from. The stranger answered

<BR>that he came from beyond the Volga, where he had been working. One

word led to another, and the man went on to say that

<BR>many people were settling in those parts. He told how some people from

his village had settled there. They had joined the

<BR>Commune, and had had twenty-five acres per man granted them. The land

was so good, he said, that the rye sown on it grew as

<BR>high as a horse, and so thick that five cuts of a sickle made a sheaf.

One peasant, he said, had brought nothing with him but his

<BR>bare hands, and now he had six horses and two cows of his own.



<P>Pah&oacute;m's heart kindled with desire. He thought:



<P>'Why should I suffer in this narrow hole, if one can live so well elsewhere?

I will sell my land and my homestead here, and with

<BR>the money I will start afresh over there and get everything new. In

this crowded place one is always having trouble. But I must

<BR>first go and find out all about it myself.



<P>Towards summer he got ready and started. He went down the Volga on a

steamer to Sam&aacute;ra, then walked another three hundred

<BR>miles on foot, and at last reached the place. It was just as the stranger

had said. The peasants had plenty of land: every man had

<BR>twenty-five acres of Communal land given him for his use, and any one

who had money could buy, besides, at two shillings an

<BR>acre[20] as much good freehold land as he wanted.



<P>Having found out all he wished to know, Pah&oacute;m returned home as

autumn came on, and began selling off his belongings. He sold

<BR>his land at a profit, sold his homestead and all his cattle, and withdrew

from membership of the Commune. He only waited till the

<BR>spring, and then started with his family for the new settlement.



<P>IV



<P>As soon as Pah&oacute;m and his family arrived at their new abode, he

applied for admission into the Commune of a large village. He

<BR>stood treat to the Elders, and obtained the necessary documents. Five

shares of Communal land were given him for his own and

<BR>his sons' use: that is to say -- 125 acres (not all together but in

different fields) besides the use of the Communal pasture. Pah&oacute;m

<BR>put up the buildings he needed, and bought cattle. Of the Communal

land alone he had three times as much as at his former home,

<BR>and the land was good corn-land. He was ten times better off than he

had been. He had plenty of arable land and pasturage, and

<BR>could keep as many head of cattle as he liked.



<P>At first, in the bustle of building and settling down, Pah&oacute;m

was pleased with it all, but when he got used to it he began to think that

<BR>even here he had not enough land. The first year, he sowed wheat on

his share of the Communal land, and had a good crop. He

<BR>wanted to go on sowing wheat, but had not enough Communal land for

the purpose, and what he had already used was not

<BR>available; for in those parts wheat is only sown on virgin soil or

on fallow land. It is sown for one or two years, and then the land

<BR>lies fallow till it is again overgrown with prairie grass. There were

many who wanted such land, and there was not enough for all;

<BR>so that people quarrelled about it. Those who were better off, wanted

it for growing wheat, and those who were poor, wanted it to

<BR>let to dealers, so that they might raise money to pay their taxes.

Pah&oacute;m wanted to sow more wheat; so he rented land from a

<BR>dealer for a year. He sowed much wheat and had a fine crop, but the

land was too far from the village -- the wheat had to be

<BR>carted more than ten miles. After a time Pah&oacute;m noticed that

some peasant-dealers were living on separate farms, and were

<BR>growing wealthy; and he thought:



<P>'If I were to buy some freehold land, and have a homestead on it, it

would be a different thing altogether. Then it would all be nice

<BR>and compact.'



<P>The question of buying freehold land recurred to him again and again.



<P>He went on in the same way for three years: renting land and sowing

wheat. The seasons turned out well and the crops were

<BR>good, so that he began to lay money by. He might have gone on living

contentedly, but he grew tired of having to rent other

<BR>people's land every year, and having to scramble for it. Wherever there

was good land to be had, the peasants would rush for it

<BR>and it was taken up at once, so that unless you were sharp about it

you got none. It happened in the third year that he and a dealer

<BR>together rented a piece of pasture land from some peasants; and they

had already ploughed it up, when there was some dispute,

<BR>and the peasants went to law about it, and things fell out so that

the labour was all lost.



<P>'If it were my own land,' thought Pah&oacute;m, 'I should be independent,

and there would not be all this unpleasantness.'



<P>So Pah&oacute;m began looking out for land which he could buy; and he

came across a peasant who had bought thirteen hundred acres,

<BR>but having got into difficulties was willing to sell again cheap. Pah&oacute;m

bargained and haggled with him, and at last they settled the

<BR>price at 1,500 roubles, part in cash and part to be paid later. They

had all but clinched the matter, when a passing dealer happened

<BR>to stop at Pah&oacute;m's one day to get a feed for his horses. He

drank tea with Pah&oacute;m, and they had a talk. The dealer said that

he

<BR>was just returning from the land of the Bashk&iacute;rs, far away,

where he had bought thirteen thousand acres of land, all for 1,000

<BR>roubles. Pah&oacute;m questioned him further, and the tradesman said:



<P>'All one need do is to make friends with the chiefs. I gave away about

one hundred roubles, worth of dressing-gowns and carpets,

<BR>besides a case of tea, and I gave wine to those who would drink it;

and I got the land for less than twopence an acre[21]. And he

<BR>showed Pah&oacute;m the title-deeds, saying:



<P>'The land lies near a river, and the whole prairie is virgin soil.'



<P>Pah&oacute;m plied him with questions, and the tradesman said:



<P>'There is more land there than you could cover if you walked a year,

and it all belongs to the Bashk&iacute;rs. They are as simple as

<BR>sheep, and land can be got almost for nothing.'



<P>'There now,' thought Pah&oacute;m, 'with my one thousand roubles, why

should I get only thirteen hundred acres, and saddle myself with

<BR>a debt besides. If I take it out there, I can get more than ten times

as much for the money.'



<P>V



<P>Pah&oacute;m inquired how to get to the place, and as soon as the tradesman

had left him, he prepared to go there himself. He left his

<BR>wife to look after the homestead, and started on his journey taking

his man with him. They stopped at a town on their way, and

<BR>bought a case of tea, some wine, and other presents, as the tradesman

had advised. On and on they went until they had gone more

<BR>than three hundred miles, and on the seventh day they came to a place

where the Bashk&iacute;rs had pitched their tents. It was all just

<BR>as the tradesman had said. The people lived on the steppes, by a river,

in felt-covered tents[22]. They neither tilled the ground, nor

<BR>ate bread. Their cattle and horses grazed in herds on the steppe. The

colts were tethered behind the tents, and the mares were

<BR>driven to them twice a day. The mares were milked, and from the milk

kumiss was made. It was the women who prepared

<BR>kumiss, and they also made cheese. As far as the men were concerned,

drinking kumiss and tea, eating mutton, and playing on

<BR>their pipes, was all they cared about. They were all stout and merry,

and all the summer long they never thought of doing any

<BR>work. They were quite ignorant, and knew no Russian, but were good-natured

enough.



<P>As soon as they saw Pah&oacute;m, they came out of their tents and gathered

round their visitor. An interpreter was found, and Pah&oacute;m

<BR>told them he had come about some land. The Bashk&iacute;rs seemed very

glad they took Pah&oacute;m and led him into one of the best tents,

<BR>where they made him sit on some down cushions placed on a carpet, while

they sat round him. They gave him tea and kumiss, and

<BR>had a sheep killed, and gave him mutton to eat. Pah&oacute;m took presents

out of his cart and distributed them among the Bashk&iacute;rs, and

<BR>divided amongst them the tea. The Bashk&iacute;rs were delighted. They

talked a great deal among themselves, and then told the

<BR>interpreter to translate.



<P>'They wish to tell you,' said the interpreter, 'that they like you,

and that it is our custom to do all we can to please a guest and to

<BR>repay him for his gifts. You have given us presents, now tell us which

of the things we possess please you best, that we may

<BR>present them to you.'



<P>'What pleases me best here,' answered Pah&oacute;m 'is your land. Our

land is crowded, and the soil is exhausted; but you have plenty of

<BR>land and it is good land. I never saw the like of it.'



<P>The interpreter translated. The Bashk&iacute;rs talked among themselves

for a while. Pah&oacute;m could not understand what they were

<BR>saying, but saw that they were much amused, and that they shouted and

laughed. Then they were silent and looked at Pah&oacute;m

<BR>while the interpreter said:



<P>'They wish me to tell you that in return for your presents they will

gladly give you as much land as you want. You have only to

<BR>point it out with your hand and it is yours.'



<P>The Bashk&iacute;rs talked again for a while and began to dispute. Pah&oacute;m

asked what they were disputing about, and the interpreter told

<BR>him that some of them thought they ought to ask their Chief about the

land and not act in his absence, while others thought there

<BR>was no need to wait for his return.



<P>VI



<P>While the Bashk&iacute;rs were disputing, a man in a large fox-fur cap

appeared on the scene. They all became silent and rose to their

<BR>feet. The interpreter said, 'This is our Chief himself.'



<P>Pah&oacute;m immediately fetched the best dressing-gown and five pounds

of tea, and offered these to the Chief. The Chief accepted

<BR>them, and seated himself in the place of honour. The Bashk&iacute;rs

at once began telling him something. The Chief listened for a while,

<BR>then made a sign with his head for them to be silent, and addressing

himself to Pah&oacute;m, said in Russian:



<P>'Well, let it be so. Choose whatever piece of land you like; we have

plenty of it.'



<P>'How can I take as much as I like?' thought Pah&oacute;m. 'I must get

a deed to make it secure, or else they may say, "It is yours," and

<BR>afterwards may take it away again.'



<P>'Thank you for your kind words,' he said aloud. 'You have much land,

and I only want a little. But I should like to be sure which bit

<BR>is mine. Could it not be measured and made over to me? Life and death

are in God's hands. You good people give it to me, but

<BR>your children might wish to take it away again.'



<P>'You are quite right,' said the Chief. 'We will make it over to you.'



<P>'I heard that a dealer had been here,' continued Pah&oacute;m, 'and

that you gave him a little land, too, and signed title-deeds to that

<BR>effect. I should like to have it done in the same way.'



<P>The Chief understood.



<P>'Yes,' replied he, 'that can be done quite easily. We have a scribe,

and we will go to town with you and have the deed properly

<BR>sealed.'



<P>'And what will be the price?' asked Pah&oacute;m.



<P>'Our price is always the same: one thousand roubles a day.'



<P>Pah&oacute;m did not understand.



<P>'A day? What measure is that? How many acres would that be?'



<P>'We do not know how to reckon it out,' said the Chief. 'We sell it by

the day. As much as you can go round on your feet in a day is

<BR>yours, and the price is one thousand roubles a day.'



<P>Pah&oacute;m was surprised.



<P>'But in a day you can get round a large tract of land,' he said.



<P>The Chief laughed.



<P>'It will all be yours!' said he. 'But there is one condition: If you

don't return on the same day to the spot whence you started, your

<BR>money is lost.'



<P>'But how am I to mark the way that I have gone?'



<P>'Why, we shall go to any spot you like, and stay there. You must start

from that spot and make your round, taking a spade with

<BR>you. Wherever you think necessary, make a mark. At every turning, dig

a hole and pile up the turf; then afterwards we will go

<BR>round with a plough from hole to hole. You may make as large a circuit

as you please, but before the sun sets you must return to

<BR>the place you started from. All the land you cover will be yours.'



<P>Pah&oacute;m was delighted. It was decided to start early next morning.

They talked a while, and after drinking some more kumiss and

<BR>eating some more mutton, they had tea again, and then the night came

on. They gave Pah&oacute;m a feather-bed to sleep on, and the

<BR>Bashk&iacute;rs dispersed for the night, promising to assemble the

next morning at daybreak and ride out before sunrise to the appointed

<BR>spot.



<P>VII



<P>Pah&oacute;m lay on the feather-bed, but could not sleep. He kept thinking

about the land.



<P>'What a large tract I will mark off!' thought he. 'I can easily do thirty-five

miles in a day. The days are long now, and within a

<BR>circuit of thirty-five miles what a lot of land there will be! I will

sell the poorer land, or let it to peasants, but I'll pick out the best

<BR>and farm it. I will buy two ox-teams, and hire two more labourers.

About a hundred and fifty acres shall be plough-land, and I will

<BR>pasture cattle on the rest.'



<P>Pah&oacute;m lay awake all night, and dozed off only just before dawn.

Hardly were his eyes closed when he had a dream. He thought

<BR>he was lying in that same tent, and heard somebody chuckling outside.

He wondered who it could be, and rose and went out and

<BR>he saw the Bashk&iacute;r Chief sitting in front of the tent holding

his sides and rolling about with laughter. Going nearer to the Chief,

<BR>Pah&oacute;m asked: 'What are you laughing at?' But he saw that it

was no longer the Chief, but the dealer who had recently stopped at

<BR>his house and had told him about the land. Just as Pah&oacute;m was

going to ask, 'Have you been here long?' he saw that it was not the

<BR>dealer, but the peasant who had come up from the Volga, long ago, to

Pah&oacute;m's old home. Then he saw that it was not the peasant

<BR>either, but the Devil himself with hoofs and horns sitting there and

chuckling, and before him lay a man barefoot, prostrate on the

<BR>ground, with only trousers and a shirt on. And Pah&oacute;m dreamt

that he looked more attentively to see what sort of a man it was that

<BR>was lying there, and he saw that the man was dead and that it was himself!

He awoke horror-struck.



<P>'What things one does dream,' thought he.



<P>Looking round he saw through the open door that the dawn was breaking.



<P>'It's time to wake them up,' thought he. 'We ought to be starting.'



<P>He got up, roused his man (who was sleeping in his cart), bade him harness;

and went to call the Bashk&iacute;rs.



<P>'It's time to go to the steppe to measure the land,' he said.



<P>The Bashk&iacute;rs rose and assembled, and the Chief came too. Then

they began drinking kumiss again, and offered Pah&oacute;m some tea,

<BR>but he would not wait.



<P>'If we are to go, let us go. It is high time,' said he.



<P>VIII



<P>The Bashk&iacute;rs got ready and they all started: some mounted on

horses, and some in carts. Pah&oacute;m drove in his own small cart with

<BR>his servant, and took a spade with him. When they reached the steppe,

the morning red was beginning to kindle. They ascended a

<BR>hillock (called by the Bashk&iacute;rs a shikhan) and dismounting from

their carts and their horses, gathered in one spot. The Chief came

<BR>up to Pah&oacute;m and stretching out his arm towards the plain:



<P>'See,' said he, 'all this, as far as your eye can reach, is ours. You

may have any part of it you like.'



<P>Pah&oacute;m's eyes glistened: it was all virgin soil, as flat as the

palm of your hand, as black as the seed of a poppy, and in the hollows

<BR>different kinds of grasses grew breast high.



<P>The Chief took off his fox-fur cap, placed it on the ground and said:



<P>'This will be the mark. Start from here, and return here again. All

the land you go round shall be yours.'



<P>Pah&oacute;m took out his money and put it on the cap. Then he took

off his outer coat, remaining in his sleeveless under-coat. He

<BR>unfastened his girdle and tied it tight below his stomach, put a little

bag of bread into the breast of his coat, and tying a flask of

<BR>water to his girdle, he drew up the tops of his boots, took the spade

from his man, and stood ready to start. He considered for

<BR>some moments which way he had better go -- it was tempting everywhere.



<P>'No matter,' he concluded, 'I will go towards the rising sun.'



<P>He turned his face to the east, stretched himself and waited for the

sun to appear above the rim.



<P>'I must lose no time,' he thought, 'and it is easier walking while it

is still cool.'



<P>The sun's rays had hardly flashed above the horizon, before Pah&oacute;m,

carrying the spade over his shoulder went down into the

<BR>steppe.



<P>Pah&oacute;m started walking neither slowly nor quickly. After having

gone a thousand yards he stopped, dug a hole, and placed pieces

<BR>of turf one on another to make it more visible. Then he went on; and

now that he had walked off his stiffness he quickened his

<BR>pace. After a while he dug another hole.



<P>Pah&oacute;m looked back. The hillock could be distinctly seen in the

sunlight, with the people on it, and the glittering tyres of the

<BR>cart-wheels. At a rough guess Pah&oacute;m concluded that he had walked

three miles. It was growing warmer; he took off his

<BR>under-coat, flung it across his shoulder, and went on again. It had

grown quite warm now; he looked at the sun, it was time to think

<BR>of breakfast.



<P>'The first shift is done, but there are four in a day, and it is too

soon yet to turn. But I will just take off my boots,' said he to

<BR>himself.



<P>He sat down, took off his boots, stuck them into his girdle, and went

on. It was easy walking now.



<P>'I will go on for another three miles,' thought he, 'and then turn to

the left. This spot is so fine, that it would be a pity to lose it. The

<BR>further one goes, the better the land seems.'



<P>He went straight on for a while, and when he looked round, the hillock

was scarcely visible and the people on it looked like black

<BR>ants, and he could just see something glistening there in the sun.



<P>'Ah,' thought Pah&oacute;m, 'I have gone far enough in this direction,

it is time to turn. Besides I am in a regular sweat, and very thirsty.'



<P>He stopped, dug a large hole, and heaped up pieces of turf. Next he

untied his flask, had a drink, and then turned sharply to the

<BR>left. He went on and on; the grass was high, and it was very hot.



<P>Pah&oacute;m began to grow tired: he looked at the sun and saw that

it was noon.



<P>'Well,' he thought, 'I must have a rest.'



<P>He sat down, and ate some bread and drank some water; but he did not

lie down, thinking that if he did he might fall asleep. After

<BR>sitting a little while, he went on again. At first he walked easily:

the food had strengthened him; but it had become terribly hot, and

<BR>he felt sleepy; still he went on, thinking: 'An hour to suffer, a life-time

to live.'



<P>He went a long way in this direction also, and was about to turn to

the left again, when he perceived a damp hollow: 'It would be a

<BR>pity to leave that out,' he thought. 'Flax would do well there.' So

he went on past the hollow, and dug a hole on the other side of it

<BR>before he turned the corner. Pah&oacute;m looked towards the hillock.

The heat made the air hazy: it seemed to be quivering, and through

<BR>the haze the people on the hillock could scarcely be seen.



<P>'Ah!' thought Pah&oacute;m, 'I have made the sides too long; I must

make this one shorter.' And he went along the third side stepping

<BR>faster. He looked at the sun: it was nearly half way to the horizon,

and he had not yet done two miles of the third side of the

<BR>square. He was still ten miles from the goal.



<P>'No,' he thought, 'though it will make my land lop-sided, I must hurry

back in a straight line now. I might go too far, and as it is I

<BR>have a great deal of land.'



<P>So Pah&oacute;m hurriedly dug a hole, and turned straight towards the

hillock.



<P>IX



<P>Pah&oacute;m went straight towards the hillock, but he now walked with

difficulty. He was done up with the heat, his bare feet were cut

<BR>and bruised, and his legs began to fail. He longed to rest, but it

was impossible if he meant to get back before sunset. The sun

<BR>waits for no man, and it was sinking lower and lower.



<P>'Oh dear,' he thought, 'if only I have not blundered trying for too

much! What if I am too late?'



<P>He looked towards the hillock and at the sun. He was still far from

his goal, and the sun was already near the rim



<P>Pah&oacute;m walked on and on; it was very hard walking, but he went

quicker and quicker. He pressed on, but was still far from the

<BR>place. He began running, threw away his coat, his boots, his flask,

and his cap, and kept only the spade which he used as a

<BR>support.



<P>'What shall I do,' he thought again, 'I have grasped too much, and ruined

the whole affair. I can't get there before the sun sets.'



<P>And this fear made him still more breathless. Pah&oacute;m went on running,

his soaking shirt and trousers stuck to him, and his mouth

<BR>was parched. His breast was working like a blacksmith's bellows, his

heart was beating like a hammer, and his legs were giving

<BR>way as if they did not belong to him. Pah&oacute;m was seized with

terror lest he should die of the strain.



<P>Though afraid of death, he could not stop. 'After having run all that

way they will call me a fool if I stop now,' thought he. And he

<BR>ran on and on, and drew near and heard the Bashk&iacute;rs yelling

and shouting to him, and their cries inflamed his heart still more. He

<BR>gathered his last strength and ran on.



<P>The sun was close to the rim, and cloaked in mist looked large, and

red as blood. Now, yes now, it was about to set! The sun was

<BR>quite low, but he was also quite near his aim. Pah&oacute;m could already

see the people on the hillock waving their arms to hurry him up.

<BR>He could see the fox-fur cap on the ground, and the money on it, and

the Chief sitting on the ground holding his sides. And Pah&oacute;m

<BR>remembered his dream.



<P>'There is plenty of land,' thought he, 'but will God let me live on

it? I have lost my life, I have lost my life! I shall never reach that

<BR>spot!'



<P>Pah&oacute;m looked at the sun, which had reached the earth: one side

of it had already disappeared. With all his remaining strength he

<BR>rushed on, bending his body forward so that his legs could hardly follow

fast enough to keep him from falling. Just as he reached

<BR>the hillock it suddenly grew dark. He looked up -- the sun had already

set! He gave a cry: 'All my labour has been in vain,' thought

<BR>he, and was about to stop, but he heard the Bashk&iacute;rs still shouting,

and remembered that though to him, from below, the sun

<BR>seemed to have set, they on the hillock could still see it. He took

a long breath and ran up the hillock. It was still light there. He

<BR>reached the top and saw the cap. Before it sat the Chief laughing and

holding his sides. Again Pah&oacute;m remembered his dream, and

<BR>he uttered a cry: his legs gave way beneath him, he fell forward and

reached the cap with his hands.



<P>'Ah, that's a fine fellow!' exclaimed the Chief 'He has gained much

land!'



<P>Pah&oacute;m's servant came running up and tried to raise him, but he

saw that blood was flogging from his mouth. Pah&oacute;m was dead!



<P>The Bashk&iacute;rs clicked their tongues to show their pity.



<P>His servant picked up the spade and dug a grave long enough for Pah&oacute;m

to he in, and buried him in it. Six feet from his head to his

<BR>heels was all he needed.

<P>I



<P>A SHOEMAKER named Simon, who had neither house nor land of his own,

lived with his wife and children in a peasant's hut,

<BR>and earned his living by his work. Work was cheap but bread was dear,

and what he earned he spent for food. The man and

<BR>his wife had but one sheepskin coat between them for winter wear, and

even that was worn to tatters, and this was the second

<BR>year he had been wanting to buy sheep-skins for a new coat. Before

winter Simon saved up a little money: a three-rouble note

<BR>lay hidden in his wife's box, and five roubles and twenty kopeks[6]

were owed him by customers in the village.



<P>So one morning he prepared to go to the village to buy the sheep-skins.

He put on over his shirt his wife's wadded nankeen

<BR>jacket, and over that he put his own cloth coat. He took the three-rouble

note in his pocket, cut himself a stick to serve as a

<BR>staff, and started off after breakfast. 'I'll collect the five roubles

that are due to me,' thought he, 'add the three I have got, and

<BR>that will be enough to buy sheep-skins for the winter coat.'



<P>He came to the village and called at a peasant's hut, but the man was

not at home. The peasant's wife promised that the money

<BR>should be paid next week, but she would not pay it herself. Then Simon

called on another peasant, but this one swore he had

<BR>no money, and would only pay twenty kopeks which he owed for a pair

of boots Simon had mended. Simon then tried to buy

<BR>the sheep-skins on credit, but the deader would not trust him.



<P>'Bring your money,' said he, 'then you may have your pick of the skins.

We know what debt-collecting is like.'



<P>So all the business the shoemaker did was to get the twenty kopeks for

boots he had mended, and to take a pair of felt boots a

<BR>peasant gave him to sole with leather.



<P>Simon felt downhearted. He spent the twenty kopeks on v&oacute;dka,

and started homewards without having bought any skins. In

<BR>the morning he had felt the frost; but now, after drinking the v&oacute;dka,

he felt warm even without a sheep-skin coat. He trudged

<BR>along, striking his stick on the frozen earth with one hand, swinging

the felt boots with the other, and talking to himself.



<P>'I'm quite warm,' said he, 'though I have no sheepskin coat. I've had

a drop, and it runs through all my veins. I need no

<BR>sheepskins. I go along and don't worry about anything. That's the sort

of man I am! What do I care? I can live without sheep

<BR>skins. I don't need them. My wife will fret, to be sure. And, true

enough, it's a shame; one works all day long, and then does

<BR>not get paid. Stop a bit! If you don't bring that money along, sure

enough I'll skin you, blessed if I don't. How's that? He pays

<BR>twenty kopeks at a time! What can I do with twenty kopeks: Drink it

-- that's all one can do! Hard up, he says he is! So he

<BR>may be -- but what about me? You have house, and cattle, and everything;

I've only what I stand up in! You have corn of your

<BR>own growing; I have to buy every grain. Do what I will, I must spend

three roubles every week for bread alone. I come home

<BR>and find the bread all used up, and I have to fork out another rouble

and a half. So just you pay up what you owe, and no

<BR>nonsense about it!'



<P>By this time he had nearly reached the shrine at the bend of the road.

Looking up, he saw something whitish behind the shrine.

<BR>The daylight was fading, and the shoemaker peered at the thing without

being able to make out what it was. 'There was no

<BR>white stone here before. Can it be an ox? It's not like an ox. It has

a head like a man, but it's too white; and what could a man

<BR>be doing there?'



<P>He came closer, so that it was clearly visible. To his surprise it really

was a man, alive or dead, sitting naked, leaning motionless

<BR>against the shrine. Terror seized the shoemaker, and he thought, 'Some

one has killed him, stripped him, and left him here. If I

<BR>meddle I shall surely get into trouble.'



<P>So the shoemaker went on. He passed in front of the shrine so that he

could not see the man. When he had gone some way, he

<BR>looked back, and saw that the man was no longer leaning against the

shrine, but was moving as if looking towards him. The

<BR>shoemaker felt more frightened than before, and thought, 'Shall I go

back to him, or shall I go on? If I go near him something

<BR>dreadful may happen. Who knows who the fellow is? He has not come here

for any good. If I go near him he may jump up and

<BR>throttle me, and there will be no getting away. Or if not, he'd still

be a burden on one's hands. What could I do with a naked

<BR>man? I couldn't give him my last clothes. Heaven only help me to get

away!'



<P>So the shoemaker hurried on, leaving the shrine behind him -- when suddenly

his conscience smote him and he stopped in the

<BR>road.



<P>'What are you doing, Simon?' said he to himself. 'The man may be dying

of want, and you slip past afraid. Have you grown so

<BR>rich as to be afraid of robbers? Ah, Simon, shame on you!'



<P>So he turned back and went up to the man.



<P>II



<P>Simon approached the stranger, looked at him, and saw that he was a

young man, fit, with no bruises on his body, only

<BR>evidently freezing and frightened, and he sat there leaning back without

looking up at Simon, as if too faint to lift his eyes. Simon

<BR>went close to him, and then the man seemed to wake up. Turning his

head, he opened his eyes and looked into Simon's face.

<BR>That one look was enough to make Simon fond of the man. He threw the

felt boots on the ground undid his sash, laid it on the

<BR>boots, and took off his cloth coat.



<P>'It's not a time for talking,' said he. 'Come, put this coat on at once!'

And Simon took the man by the elbows and helped him to

<BR>rise. As he stood there, Simon saw that his body was clean and in good

condition, his hands and feet shapely, and his face

<BR>good and kind. He threw his coat over the man's shoulders but the latter

could not find the sleeves. Simon guided his arms into

<BR>them, and drawing the coat well on trapped it closely about him, tying

the sash round the man's waist.



<P>Simon even took off his torn cap to put it on the man's head, but then

his own head felt cold, and he thought: 'I'm quite bald,

<BR>while he has long curly hair.' So he put his cap on his own head again.

'It will be better to give him something for his feet,'

<BR>thought he; and he made the man sit down, and helped him to put on

the felt boots, saying, 'There, friend, now move about and

<BR>warm yourself. Other matters can be settled later on. Can you walk?'



<P>The man stood up and looked kindly at Simon, but could not say a word.



<P>'Why don't you speak?' said Simon. 'It's too cold to stay here; we must

be getting home. There now, take my stick, and if

<BR>you're feeling weak, lean on that. Now step out!'



<P>The man started walking, and moved easily, not lagging behind.



<P>As they went along, Simon asked him, 'And where do you belong to?'



<P>'I'm not from these parts.'



<P>'I thought as much. I know the folks hereabouts. But how did you come

to be there by the shrine?'



<P>'I cannot tell.'



<P>'Has some one been ill-treating you?'



<P>'No one has ill-treated me. God has punished me.



<P>'Of course God rules all. Still, you'll have to find food and shelter

somewhere. Where do you want to go to?'



<P>'It is all the same to me.'



<P>Simon was amazed. The man did not look like a rogue, and he spoke gently,

but yet he gave no account of himself. Still Simon

<BR>thought, 'Who knows what may have happened?' And he said to the stranger:

'Well then, come home with me, and at least

<BR>warm yourself awhile.'



<P>So Simon walked towards his home, and the stranger kept up with him,

walking at his side. The wind had risen and Simon felt

<BR>it cold under his shirt. He was getting over his tipsiness by now,

and began to feel the frost. He went along sniffling and

<BR>wrapping his wife's coat round him, and he thought to himself: 'There

now -- talk about sheepskins! I went out for sheepskins

<BR>and come home without even a coat to my back and what is more, I'm

bringing a naked man along with me. Matry&oacute;na won't

<BR>be pleased!' And when he thought of his wife he felt sad; but when

he looked at the stranger and remembered how he had

<BR>looked up at him at the shrine, his heart was glad.



<P>III



<P>Simon's wife had everything ready early that day. She had cut wood,

brought water, fed the children eaten her own meal, and

<BR>now she sat thinking. She wondered when she ought to make bread: now

or to-morrow? There was still a large piece left.



<P>'If Simon has had some dinner in town,' thought she, and does not eat

much for supper, the bread will last out another day.'



<P>She weighed the piece of bread in her hand again and again, and thought:

'I won't make any more to-day. We have only

<BR>enough flour left to bake one batch. We can manage to make this last

out till Friday.'



<P>So Matry&oacute;na put away the bread, and sat down at the table to

patch her husband's shirt. While she worked she thought how

<BR>her husband was buying skins for a winter coat.



<P>'If only the dealer does not cheat him. My good man is much too simple;

he cheats nobody, but any child can take him in. Eight

<BR>roubles is a lot of money -- he should get a good coat at that price.

Not tanned skins, but still a proper winter coat. How

<BR>difficult it was last winter to get on without a warm coat. I could

neither get down to the river, nor go out anywhere. When he

<BR>went out he put on all we had, and there was nothing left for me. He

did not start very early to-day, but still it's time he was

<BR>back. I only hope he has not gone on the spree!'



<P>Hardly had Matry&oacute;na thought this, when steps were heard on the

threshold, and some one entered. Matry&oacute;na stuck her needle

<BR>into her work and went out into the passage. There she saw two men:

Simon, and with him a man without a hat, and wearing

<BR>felt boots.



<P>Matry&oacute;na noticed at once that her husband smelt of spirits. 'There

now, he has been drinking,' thought she. And when she saw

<BR>that he was coatless, had only her jacket on, brought no parcel, stood

there silent, and seemed ashamed, her heart was ready

<BR>to break with disappointment. 'He has drunk the money,' thought she,

'and has been on the spree with some good-for-nothing

<BR>fellow whom he has brought home with him.'



<P>Matry&oacute;na let them pass into the hut, followed them in, and saw

that the stranger was a young, slight man, wearing her husband's

<BR>coat. There was no shirt to be seen under it, and he had no hat. Having

entered, he stood neither moving, nor raising his eyes,

<BR>and Matry&oacute;na thought: 'He must be a bad man -- he's afraid.'



<P>Matry&oacute;na frowned, and stood beside the oven looking to see what

they would do.



<P>Simon took off his cap and sat down on the bench as if things were all

right.



<P>'Come, Matry&oacute;na; if supper is ready, let us have some.'



<P>Matry&oacute;na muttered something to herself and did not move, but

stayed where she was, by the oven. She looked first at the one

<BR>and then at the other of them, and only shook her head. Simon saw that

his wife was annoyed, but tried to pass it off.

<BR>Pretending not to notice anything, he took the stranger by the arm.



<P>'Sit down, friend,' said he, 'and let us have some supper.'



<P>The stranger sat down on the bench.



<P>'Haven't you cooked anything for us?' said Simon.



<P>Matry&oacute;na's anger boiled over. 'I've cooked, but not for you.

It seems to me you have drunk your wits away. You went to buy

<BR>a sheep-skin coat, but come home without so much as the coat you had

on, and bring a naked vagabond home with you. I

<BR>have no supper for drunkards like you.'



<P>'That's enough, Matry&oacute;na. Don't wag your tongue without reason!

You had better ask what sort of man --'



<P>'And you tell me what you've done with the money?'



<P>Simon found the pocket of the jacket, drew out the three-rouble note,

and unfolded it.



<P>'Here is the money. Tr&iacute;fonof did not pay, but promises to pay

soon.'



<P>Matry&oacute;na got still more angry; he had bought no sheep-skins,

but had put his only coat on some naked fellow and had even

<BR>brought him to their house.



<P>She snatched up the note from the table, took it to put away in safety,

and said: 'I have no supper for you. We can't feed all the

<BR>naked drunkards in the world.'



<P>'There now, Matry&oacute;na, hold your tongue a bit. First hear what

a man has to say!'



<P>'Much wisdom I shall hear from a drunken fool. I was right in not wanting

to marry you -- a drunkard. The linen my mother

<BR>gave me you drank; and now you've been to buy a coat -- and have drunk

it too!'



<P>Simon tried to explain to his wife that he had only spent twenty kopeks;

tried to tell how he had found the man -- but Matry&oacute;na

<BR>would not let him get a word in. She talked nineteen to the dozen,

and dragged in things that had happened ten years before.



<P>Matry&oacute;na talked and talked, and at last she flew at Simon and

seized him by the sleeve.



<P>'Give me my jacket. It is the only one I have and you must needs take

it from me and wear it yourself. Give it here, you mangy

<BR>dog, and may the devil take you.'



<P>Simon began to pull off the jacket, and turned a sleeve of it inside

out; Matry&oacute;na seized the jacket and it burst its seams. She

<BR>snatched it up, threw it over her head and went to the door. She meant

to go out, but stopped undecided -- she wanted to

<BR>work off her anger, but she also wanted to learn what sort of a man

the stranger was.



<P>IV



<P>Matry&oacute;na stopped and said: 'If he were a good man he would not

be naked. Why, he hasn't even a shirt on him. If he were all

<BR>right, you would say where you came across the fellow.'



<P>'That's just what I am trying to tell you,' said Simon. 'As I came to

the shrine I saw him sitting all naked and frozen. It isn't quite

<BR>the weather to sit about naked! God sent me to him, or he would have

perished. What was I to do? How do we know what

<BR>may have happened to him? So I took him, clothed him, and brought him

along. Don't be so angry, Matry&oacute;na. It is a sin.

<BR>Remember, we all must die one day.'



<P>Angry words rose to Matry&oacute;na's lips, but she looked at the stranger

and was silent. He sat on the edge of the bench,

<BR>motionless, his hands folded on his knees, his head drooping on his

breast, his eyes closed, and his brows knit as if in pain.

<BR>Matry&oacute;na was silent, and Simon said: 'Matry&oacute;na, have

you no love of God?'



<P>Matry&oacute;na heard these words, and as she looked at the stranger,

suddenly her heart softened towards him. She came back from

<BR>the door, and going to the oven she got out the supper. Setting a cup

on the table, she poured out some kvas[7]. Then she

<BR>brought out the last piece of bread, and set out a knife and spoons.



<P>'Eat, if you want to,' said she.



<P>Simon drew the stranger to the table.



<P>'Take your place, young man,' said he.



<P>Simon cut the bread, crumbled it into the broth, and they began to eat.

Matry&oacute;na sat at the corner of the table, resting her head

<BR>on her hand and looking at the stranger.



<P>And Matry&oacute;na was touched with pity for the stranger, and began

to feel fond of him. And at once the stranger's face lit up; his

<BR>brows were no longer bent, he raised his eyes and smiled at Matry&oacute;na.



<P>When they had finished supper, the woman cleared away the things and

began questioning the stranger. 'Where are you from?'

<BR>said she.



<P>'I am not from these parts.'



<P>'But how did you come to be on the road?'



<P>'I may not tell.'



<P>'Did some one rob you?'



<P>'God punished me.'



<P>'And you were lying there naked?'



<P>'Yes, naked and freezing. Simon saw me and had pity on me. He took off

his coat, put it on me and brought me here. And you

<BR>have fed me, given me drink, and shown pity on me. God will reward

you!'



<P>Matry&oacute;na rose, took from the window Simon's old shirt she had

been patching, and gave it to the stranger. She also brought

<BR>out a pair of trousers for him.



<P>'There,' said she, 'I see you have no shirt. Put this on, and lie down

where you please, in the loft or on the oven[8].'



<P>The stranger took off the coat, put on the shirt, and lay down in the

loft. Matry&oacute;na put out the candle, took the coat, and

<BR>climbed to where her husband lay.



<P>Matry&oacute;na drew the skirts of the coat over her and lay down, but

could not sleep; she could not get the stranger out of her mind.



<P>When she remembered that he had eaten their last piece of bread and

that there was none for to-morrow and thought of the

<BR>shirt and trousers she had given away, she felt grieved; but when she

remembered how he had smiled, her heart was glad.



<P>Long did Matry&oacute;na lie awake, and she noticed that Simon also

was awake -- he drew the coat towards him.



<P>'Simon!'



<P>'Well?'



<P>'You have had the last of the bread, and I have not put any to rise.

I don't know what we shall do tomorrow. Perhaps I can

<BR>borrow some of neighbour Martha.'



<P>'If we're alive we shall find something to eat.'



<P>The woman lay still awhile, and then said, 'He seems a good man, but

why does he not tell us who he is?'



<P>'I suppose he has his reasons.'



<P>'Simon!'



<P>'Well?'



<P>'We give; but why does nobody give us anything?'



<P>Simon did not know what to say; so he only said, 'Let us stop talking,'

and turned over and went to sleep.



<P>V



<P>In the morning Simon awoke. The children were still asleep; his wife

had gone to the neighbour's to borrow some bread. The

<BR>stranger alone was sitting on the bench, dressed in the old shirt and

trousers, and looking upwards. His face was brighter than it

<BR>had been the day before.



<P>Simon said to him, 'Well, friend; the belly wants bread and the naked

body clothes. One has to work for a living. What work

<BR>do you know?'



<P>'I do not know any.'



<P>This surprised Simon, but he said, 'Men who want to learn can learn

anything.'



<P>'Men work, and I will work also.'



<P>'What is your name?'



<P>'Michael.'



<P>'Well Michael, if you don't wish to talk about yourself that is your

own affair; but you'll have to earn a living for yourself. If you

<BR>will work as I tell you, I will give you food and shelter.'



<P>'May God reward you! I will learn. Show me what to do.'



<P>Simon took yarn, put it round his thumb and began to twist it.



<P>'It is easy enough -- see!'



<P>Michael watched him, put some yarn round his own thumb in the same way,

caught the knack, and twisted the yarn also.



<P>Then Simon showed him how to wax the thread. This also Michael mastered.

Next Simon showed him how to twist the bristle

<BR>in, and how to sew, and this, too, Michael learned at once.



<P>Whatever Simon showed him he understood at once, and after three days

he worked as if he had sewn boots all his life. He

<BR>worked without stopping, and ate little. When work was over he sat

silently, looking upwards. He hardly went into the street,

<BR>spoke only when necessary, and neither joked nor laughed. They never

saw him smile, except that first evening when Matry&oacute;na

<BR>gave them supper.



<P>VI



<P>Day by day and week by week the year went round. Michael lived and worked

with Simon. His fame spread till people said

<BR>that no one sewed boots so neatly and strongly as Simon's workman,

Michael; and from all the district round people came to

<BR>Simon for their boots, and he began to be well off.



<P>One winter day, as Simon and Michael sat working a carriage on sledge-runners,

with three horses and with bells, drove up to

<BR>the hut. They looked out of the window; the carriage stopped at their

door, a fine servant jumped down from the box and

<BR>opened the door. A gentleman in a fur coat got out and walked up to

Simon's hut. Up jumped Matry&oacute;na and opened the door

<BR>wide. The gentleman stooped to enter the hut, and when he drew himself

up again his head nearly reached the ceiling, and he

<BR>seemed quite to fill his end of the room.



<P>Simon rose, bowed, and looked at the gentleman with astonishment. He

had never seen any one like him. Simon himself was

<BR>lean, Michael was thin, and Matry&oacute;na was dry as a bone, but

this man was like some one from another world: red-faced, burly,

<BR>with a neck like a bull's, and looking altogether as if he were cast

in iron.



<P>The gentleman puffed, threw off his fur coat, sat down on the bench,

and said, 'Which of you is the master bootmaker?'



<P>'I am, your Excellency,' said Simon, coming forward.



<P>Then the gentleman shouted to his lad, 'Hey, F&eacute;dka, bring the

leather!'



<P>The servant ran in, bringing a parcel. The gentleman took the parcel

and put it on the table.



<P>'Untie it' said he. The lad untied it.



<P>The gentleman pointed to the leather.



<P>'Look here, shoemaker,' said he, 'do you see this leather?'



<P>'Yes, your honour.'



<P>'But do you know what sort of leather it is?'



<P>Simon felt the leather and said, 'It is good leather.'



<P>'Good, indeed! Why, you fool, you never saw such leather before in your

life. It's German, and cost twenty roubles.'



<P>Simon was frightened, and said, 'Where should I ever see leather like

that?'



<P>'Just so! Now, can you make it into boots for me?'



<P>'Yes, your Excellency, I can.'



<P>Then the gentleman shouted at him: 'You can, can you? Well, remember

whom you are to make them for, and what the leather

<BR>is. You must make me boots that will wear for a year, neither losing

shape nor coming unsewn. If you can do it, take the leather

<BR>and cut it up; but if you can't, say so. I warn you now, if your boots

come unsewn or lose shape within a year, I will have you

<BR>put in prison. If they don't burst or lose shape for a year, I will

pay you ten roubles for your work.'



<P>Simon was frightened, and did not know what to say. He glanced at Michael

and nudging him with his elbow, whispered: 'Shall

<BR>I take the work?'



<P>Michael nodded his head as if to say, 'Yes, take it.'



<P>Simon did as Michael advised, and undertook to make boots that would

not lose shape or split for a whole year.



<P>Calling his servant, the gentleman told him to pull the boot off his

left leg, which he stretched out.



<P>'Take my measure!' said he.



<P>Simon stitched a paper measure seventeen inches long, smoothed it out,

knelt down, wiped his hands well on his apron so as

<BR>not to soil the gentleman's sock, and began to measure. He measured

the sole, and round the instep, and began to measure the

<BR>calf of the leg, but the paper was too short. The calf of the leg was

as thick as a beam.



<P>'Mind you don't make it too tight in the leg.'



<P>Simon stitched on another strip of paper. The gentleman twitched his

toes about in his sock, looking round at those in the hut,

<BR>and as he did so he noticed Michael.



<P>'Whom have you there?' asked he



<P>'That is my workman. He will sew the boots.'



<P>'Mind,' said the gentleman to Michael, 'remember to make them so that

they will last me a year.'



<P>Simon also looked at Michael, and saw that Michael was not looking at

the gentleman, but was gazing into the corner behind

<BR>the gentleman, as if he saw some one there. Michael looked and looked,

and suddenly he smiled, and his face became brighter.



<P>'What are you grinning at, you fool?' thundered the gentleman. 'You

had better look to it that the boots are ready in time.'



<P>'They shall be ready in good time,' said Michael.



<P>'Mind it is so,' said the gentleman, and he put on his boots and his

fur coat, wrapped the latter round him, and went to the door.

<BR>But he forgot to stoop and struck his head against the lintel.



<P>He swore and rubbed his head. Then he took his seat in the carriage

and drove away.



<P>When he had gone, Simon said: 'There's a figure of a man for you! You

could not kill him with a mallet. He almost knocked out

<BR>the lintel, but little harm it did him.'



<P>And Matry&oacute;na said: 'Living as he does, how should he not grow

strong? Death itself can't touch such a rock as that.'



<P>VII



<P>Then Simon said to Michael: 'Well, we have taken the work, but we must

see we don't get into trouble over it. The leather is

<BR>dear, and the gentleman hot-tempered. We must make no mistakes. Come,

your eye is truer and your hands have become

<BR>nimbler than mine, so you take this measure and cut out the boots.

I will finish off the sewing of the vamps.'



<P>Michael did as he was told. He took the leather spread it out on the

table, folded it in two, took a knife and began to cut out.



<P>Matry&oacute;na came and watched him cutting, and was surprised to see

how he was doing it. Matry&oacute;na was accustomed to seeing

<BR>boots made, and she looked and saw that Michael was not cutting the

leather for boots, but was cutting it round.



<P>She wished to say something, but she thought to herself: 'Perhaps I

do not understand how gentlemen's boots should be made.

<BR>I suppose Michael knows more about it -- and I won't interfere.'



<P>When Michael had cut up the leather, he took a thread and began to sew

not with two ends, as boots are sewn, but with a

<BR>single end, as for soft slippers.



<P>Again Matry&oacute;na wondered, but again she did not interfere. Michael

sewed on steadily till noon. Then Simon rose for dinner,

<BR>looked around, and saw that Michael had made slippers out of the gentleman's

leather.



<P>'Ah!' groaned Simon, and he thought, 'How is it that Michael, who has

been with me a whole year and never made a mistake

<BR>before, should do such a dreadful thing? The gentleman ordered high

boots, welted, with whole fronts, and Michael has made

<BR>soft slippers with single soles, and has wasted the leather. What am

I to say to the gentleman? I can never replace leather such

<BR>as this.'



<P>And he said to Michael, 'What are you doing friend? You have ruined

me! You know the gentleman ordered high booth but

<BR>see what you have made!'



<P>Hardly had he begun to rebuke Michael, when 'rat-tat , went the iron

ring that hung at the door. Some one was knocking. They

<BR>looked out of the window; a man had come on horseback, and was fastening

his horse. They opened the door, and the servant

<BR>who had been with the gentleman came in.



<P>'Good day,' said he.



<P>'Good day,' replied Simon. 'What can we do for you?'



<P>'My mistress has sent me about the boots.'



<P>'What about the boots?'



<P>'Why, my master no longer needs them. He is dead.'



<P>'Is it possible?'



<P>'He did not live to get home after leaving you, but died in the carriage.

When we reached home and the servants came to help

<BR>him alight he rolled over like a sack. He was dead already, and so

stiff that he could hardly be got out of the carriage. My

<BR>mistress sent me here, saying: "Tell the bootmaker that the gentleman

who ordered boots of him and left the leather for them no

<BR>longer needs the boots, but that he must quickly make soft slippers

for the corpse. Wait till they are ready, and bring them back

<BR>with you." That is why I have come.'



<P>Michael gathered up the remnants of the leather; rolled them up, took

the soft slippers he had made, slapped them together,

<BR>wiped them down with his apron, and handed them and the roll of leather

to the servant, who took them and said: 'Good-bye,

<BR>masters and good day to you!'



<P>VIII



<P>Another year passed, and another, and Michael was now living his sixth

year with Simon. He lived as before. He went

<BR>nowhere, only spoke when necessary, and had only smiled twice in all

those years -- once when Matry&oacute;na gave him food, and

<BR>a second time when the gentleman was in their hut. Simon was more than

pleased with his workman. He never now asked him

<BR>where he came from, and only feared lest Michael should go away.



<P>They were all at home one day. Matry&oacute;na was putting iron pots

in the oven, the children were running along the benches and

<BR>looking out of the window; Simon was sewing at one window, and Michael

was fastening on a heel at the other.



<P>One of the boys ran along the bench to Michael, leant on his shoulder,

and looked out of the window.



<P>'Look, Uncle Michael! There is a lady with little girls! She seems to

be coming here. And one of the girls is lame.'



<P>When the boy said that, Michael dropped his work, turned to the window,

and looked out into the street.



<P>Simon was surprised. Michael never used to look out into the street,

but now he pressed against the window, staring at

<BR>something. Simon also looked out, and saw that a well-dressed woman

was really coming to his hut, leading by the hand two

<BR>little girls in fur coats and woollen shawls. The girls could hardly

be told one from the other, except that one of them was

<BR>crippled in her left leg and walked with a limp.



<P>The woman stepped into the porch and entered the passage. Feeling about

for the entrance she found the latch, which she

<BR>lifted, and opened the door. She let the two girls go in first, and

followed them into the hut.



<P>'Good day, good folk!'



<P>'Pray come in,' said Simon. 'What can we do for you?'



<P>The woman sat down by the table. The two little girls pressed close

to her knees, afraid of the people in the hut.



<P>'I want leather shoes made for these two little girls, for spring.'



<P>'We can do that. We never have made such small shoes, but we can make

them; either welted or turnover shoes, linen lined.

<BR>My man, Michael, is a master at the work.'



<P>Simon glanced at Michael and saw that he had left his work and was sitting

with his eyes fixed on the little girls. Simon was

<BR>surprised. It was true the girls were pretty, with black eyes, plump,

and rosy-cheeked, and they wore nice kerchiefs and fur

<BR>coats, but still Simon could not understand why Michael should look

at them like that -- just as if he had known them before.

<BR>He was puzzled, but went on talking with the woman, and arranging the

price. Having fixed it, he prepared the measure. The

<BR>woman lifted the lame girl on to her lap and said: 'Take two measures

from this little girl. Make one shoe for the lame foot and

<BR>three for the sound one. They both have the same sized feet. They are

twins.'



<P>Simon took the measure and, speaking of the lame girl, said: 'How did

it happen to her? She is such a pretty girl. Was she born

<BR>so?'



<P>'No, her mother crushed her leg.'



<P>Then Matry&oacute;na joined in. She wondered who this woman was, and

whose the children were, so she said: 'Are not you their

<BR>mother, then?'



<P>'No, my good woman, I am neither their mother nor any relation to them.

They were quite strangers to me, but I adopted them.'



<P>'They are not your children and yet you are so fond of them?'



<P>'How can I help being fond of them? I fed them both at my own breasts.

I had a child of my own, but God took him. I was not

<BR>so fond of him as I now am of them.'



<P>'Then whose children are they?'



<P>IX



<P>The woman, having begun talking, told them the whole story.



<P>'It is about six years since their parents died, both in one week: their

father was buried on the Tuesday, and their mother died

<BR>on the Friday. These orphans were born three days after their father's

death, and their mother did not live another day. My

<BR>husband and I were then living as peasants in the village. We were

neighbours of theirs, our yard being next to theirs. Their

<BR>father was a lonely man; a wood-cutter in the forest. When felling

trees one day, they let one fall on him. It fell across his body

<BR>and crushed his bowels out. They hardly got him home before his soul

went to God; and that same week his wife gave birth to

<BR>twins -- these little girls. She was poor and alone; she had no one,

young or old, with her. Alone she gave them birth, and alone

<BR>she met her death.



<P>'The next morning I went to see her, but when I entered the hut, she,

poor thing, was already stark and cold. In dying she had

<BR>rolled on to this child and crushed her leg. The village folk came

to the hut washed the body, laid her out, made a coffin, and

<BR>buried her. They were good folk. The babies were left alone. What was

to be done with them? I was the only woman there

<BR>who had a baby at the time. I was nursing my first-born -- eight weeks

old. So I took them for a time. The peasants came

<BR>together, and thought and thought what to do with them, and at last

they said to me: "For the present, Mary, you had better

<BR>keep the girls, and later on we will arrange what to do for them."

So I nursed the sound one at my breast, but at first I did not

<BR>feed this crippled one. I did not suppose she would live. But then

I thought to myself, why should the poor innocent suffer? I

<BR>pitied her, and began to feed her. And so I fed my own boy and these

two -- the three of them -- at my own breast. I was

<BR>young and strong, and had good food, and God gave me so much milk that

at times it even overflowed. I used sometimes to

<BR>feed two at a time, while the third was waiting. When one had had enough

I nursed the third. And God so ordered it that these

<BR>grew up, while my own was buried before he was two years old. And I

had no more children, though we prospered. Now my

<BR>husband is working for the corn merchant at the mill. The pay is good

and we are well off. But I have no children of my own,

<BR>and how lonely I should be without these little girls! How can I help

loving them! They are the joy of my life!'



<P>She pressed the lame little girl to her with one hand while with the

other she wiped the tears from her cheeks.



<P>And Matry&oacute;na sighed, and said: 'The proverb is true that says,

"One may live without father or mother, but one cannot live

<BR>without God."'



<P>So they talked together, when suddenly the whole hut was lighted up

as though by summer lightning from the corner where

<BR>Michael sat. They all looked towards him and saw him sitting, his hands

folded on his knees, gazing upwards and smiling.



<P>X



<P>The woman went away with the girls. Michael rose from the bench, put

down his work, and took off his apron. Then, bowing

<BR>low to Simon and his wife, he said: 'Farewell, masters. God has forgiven

me. I ask your forgiveness, too, for anything done

<BR>amiss.'



<P>And they saw that a light shone from Michael. And Simon rose, bowed

down to Michael, and said: 'I see, Michael, that you

<BR>are no common man, and I can neither keep you nor question you. Only

tell me this: how is it that when I found you and

<BR>brought you home, you were gloomy, and when my wife gave you food you

smiled at her and became brighter? Then when the

<BR>gentleman came to order the boots, you smiled again and became brighter

still? And now, when this woman brought the little

<BR>girls, you smiled a third time, and have become as bright as day? Tell

me, Michael, why does your face shine so, and why did

<BR>you smile those three times?'



<P>And Michael answered: 'Light shines from me because I have been punished,

but now God has pardoned me. And I smiled

<BR>three times, because God sent me to learn three truths, and I have

learnt them. One I learnt when your wife pitied me and that is

<BR>why I smiled the first time. The second I learnt when the rich man

ordered the boots and then I smiled again. And now, when I

<BR>saw those little girls, I learnt the third and last truth, and I smiled

the third time.'



<P>And Simon said, 'Tell me, Michael, what did God punish you for? and

what were the three truths? that I, too, may know them.'



<P>And Michael answered: 'God punished me for disobeying Him. I was an

angel in heaven and disobeyed God. God sent me to

<BR>fetch a woman's soul. I flew to earth, and saw a sick woman lying alone,

who had just given birth to twin girls. They moved

<BR>feebly at their mother's side, but she could not lift them to her breast.

When she saw me, she understood that God had sent me

<BR>for her soul, and she wept and said: "Angel of God! My husband has

just been buried, killed by a falling tree. I have neither

<BR>sister, nor aunt, nor mother: no one to care for my orphans. Do not

take my soul! Let me nurse my babes, feed them, and set

<BR>them on their feet before I die. Children cannot live without father

or mother." And I hearkened to her. I placed one child at her

<BR>breast and gave the other into her arms, and returned to the Lord in

heaven. I flew to the Lord, and said: "I could not take the

<BR>soul of the mother. Her husband was killed by a tree; the woman has

twins, and prays that her soul may not be taken. She says:

<BR>'Let me nurse and feed my children, and set them on their feet. Children

cannot live without father or mother.' I have not taken

<BR>her soul." And God said: "Go -- take the mother's soul, and learn three

truths: Learn What dwells in man, What is not given

<BR>to man, and What men live by. When thou hast learnt these things, thou

shalt return to heaven." So I flew again to earth and

<BR>took the mother's soul. The babes dropped from her breasts. Her body

rolled over on the bed and crushed one babe, twisting

<BR>its leg. I rose above the village, wishing to take her soul to God;

but a wind seized me, and my wings drooped and dropped off.

<BR>Her soul rose alone to God, while I fell to earth by the roadside.'



<P>XI



<P>And Simon and Matry&oacute;na understood who it was that had lived with

them, and whom they had clothed and fed. And they wept

<BR>with awe and with joy. And the angel said: 'I was alone in the field,

naked. I had never known human needs, cold and hunger,

<BR>till I became a man. I was famished, frozen, and did not know what

to do. I saw, near the field I was in, a shrine built for God,

<BR>and I went to it hoping to find shelter. But the shrine was locked,

and I could not enter. So I sat down behind the shrine to

<BR>shelter myself at least from the wind. Evening drew on. I was hungry,

frozen, and in pain. Suddenly I heard a man coming along

<BR>the road. He carried a pair of boots, and was talking to himself. For

the first time since I became a man I saw the mortal face of

<BR>a man, and his face seemed terrible to me and I turned from it. And

I heard the man talking to himself of how to cover his body

<BR>from the cold in winter, and how to feed wife and children. And I thought:

"I am perishing of cold and hunger, and here is a man

<BR>thinking only of how to clothe himself and his wife, and how to get

bread for themselves. He cannot help me. When the man

<BR>saw me he frowned and became still more terrible, and passed me by

on the other side. I despaired, but suddenly I heard him

<BR>coming back. I looked up, and did not recognize the same man: before,

I had seen death in his face; but now he was alive, and

<BR>I recognized in him the presence of God. He came up to me, clothed

me, took me with him and brought me to his home. I

<BR>entered the house a woman came to meet us and began to speak. The woman

was still more terrible than the man had been;

<BR>the spirit of death came from her mouth; I could not breathe for the

stench of death that spread around her. She wished to drive

<BR>me out into the cold, and I knew that if she did so she would die.

Suddenly her husband spoke to her of God, and the woman

<BR>changed at once. And when she brought me food and looked at me, I glanced

at her and saw that death no longer dwelt in her;

<BR>she had become alive, and in her too I saw God.



<P>'Then I remembered the first lesson God had set me: "Learn what dwells

in man." And I understood that in man dwells Love!

<BR>I was glad that God had already begun to show me what He had promised,

and I smiled for the first time. But I had not yet

<BR>learnt all. I did not yet know What is not given to man, and What men

live by.



<P>'I lived with you, and a year passed. A man came to order boots that

should wear for a year without losing shape or cracking. I

<BR>looked at him, and suddenly, behind his shoulder, I saw my comrade

-- the angel of death. None but me saw that angel; but I

<BR>knew him, and knew that before the sun set he would take that rich

man's soul. And I thought to myself, "The man is making

<BR>preparations for a year, and does not know that he will die before

evening." And I remembered God's second saying, "Learn

<BR>what is not given to man."



<P>'What dwells in man I already knew. Now I learnt what is not given him.

It is not given to man to know his own needs. And I

<BR>smiled for the second time. I was glad to have seen my comrade angel

-- glad also that God had revealed to me the second

<BR>saying.



<P>'But I still did not know all. I did not know What men live by. And

I lived on, waiting till God should reveal to me the last

<BR>lesson. In the sixth year came the girl-twins with the woman; and I

recognized the girls, and heard how they had been kept

<BR>alive. Having heard the story, I thought, "Their mother besought me

for the children's sake, and I believed her when she said

<BR>that children cannot live without father or mother; but a stranger

has nursed them, and has brought them up." And when the

<BR>woman showed her love for the children that were not her own, and wept

over them, I saw in her the living God, and

<BR>understood What men live by. And I knew that God had revealed to me

the last lesson, and had forgiven my sin. And then I

<BR>smiled for the third time.'



<P>XII



<P>And the angel's body was bared, and he was clothed in light so that

eye could not look on him; and his voice grew louder, as

<BR>though it came not from him but from heaven above. And the angel said:



<P>'I have learnt that all men live not by care for themselves, but by

love.



<P>'It was not given to the mother to know what her children needed for

their life. Nor was it given to the rich man to know what

<BR>he himself needed. Nor is it given to any man to know whether, when

evening comes, he will need boots for his body or

<BR>slippers for his corpse.



<P>'I remained alive when I was a man, not by care of myself, but because

love was present in a passer-by, and because he and

<BR>his wife pitied and loved me. The orphans remained alive, not because

of their mother's care, but because there was love in the

<BR>heart of a woman a stranger to them, who pitied and loved them. And

all men live not by the thought they spend on their own

<BR>welfare, but because love exists in man.



<P>'I knew before that God gave life to men and desires that they should

live; now I understood more than that.



<P>'I understood that God does not wish men to live apart, and therefore

he does not reveal to them what each one needs for

<BR>himself; but he wishes them to live united, and therefore reveals to

each of them what is necessary for all.



<P>'I have now understood that though it seems to men that they live by

care for themselves, in truth it is love alone by which they

<BR>live. He who has love, is in God, and God is in him, for God is love.'



<P>And the angel sang praise to God, so that the hut trembled at his voice.

The roof opened, and a column of fire rose from earth

<BR>to heaven. Simon and his wife and children fell to the ground. Wings

appeared upon the angel's shoulders, and he rose into the

<BR>heavens.



<P>And when Simon came to himself the hut stood as before, and there was

no one in it but his own family.

<P><B>(A FOLK-TALE LONG CURRENT IN THE REGION OF THE VOLGA)</B>



<P>EMELY&Aacute;N was a labourer and worked for a master. Crossing the

meadows one day on his way to work, he nearly trod on a

<BR>frog that jumped right in front of him, but he just managed to avoid

it. Suddenly he heard some one calling to him from behind.



<P>Emely&aacute;n looked round and saw a lovely lassie, who said to him:

'Why don't you get married, Emely&aacute;n?'



<P>'How can I marry, my lass?' said he. 'I have but the clothes I stand

up in, nothing more, and no one would have me for a husband.'



<P>'Take me for a wife,' said she.



<P>Emely&aacute;n liked the maid. 'I should be glad to,' said he, 'but

where and how could we live?'



<P>'Why trouble about that?' said the girl. 'One only has to work more

and sleep less, and one can clothe and feed oneself anywhere.'



<P>'Very well then, let us marry,' said Emely&aacute;n. 'Where shall we

go to?'



<P>'Let us go to town.'



<P>So Emely&aacute;n and the lass went to town, and she took him to a small

hut on the very edge of the town, and they married and began

<BR>housekeeping.



<P>One day the King, driving through the town, passed by Emely&aacute;n's

hut. Emely&aacute;n's wife came out to see the King. The King noticed

<BR>her and was quite surprised.



<P>'Where did such a beauty come from?' said he and stopping his carriage

he called Emely&aacute;n's wife and asked her: 'Who are you?'



<P>'The peasant Emely&aacute;n's wife,' said she.



<P>'Why did you, who are such a beauty, marry a peasant?' said the King.

'You ought to be a queen!'



<P>'Thank you for your kind words,' said she, 'but a peasant husband is

good enough for me.'



<P>The King talked to her awhile and then drove on. He returned to the

palace, but could not get Emely&aacute;n's wife out of his head. All

<BR>night he did not sleep, but kept thinking how to get her for himself.

He could think of no way of doing it, so he called his servants

<BR>and told them they must find a way.



<P>The King's servants said: 'Command Emely&aacute;n to come to the palace

to work, and we will work him so hard that he will die. His

<BR>wife will be left a widow, and then you can take her for yourself.'



<P>The King followed their advice. He sent an order that Emely&aacute;n

should come to the palace as a workman and that he should live at

<BR>the palace, and his wife with him.



<P>The messengers came to Emely&aacute;n and gave him the King's message.

His wife said, 'Go, Emely&aacute;n; work all day, but come back

<BR>home at night.'



<P>So Emely&aacute;n went, and when he got to the palace the King's steward

asked him, 'Why have you come alone, without your wife?'



<P>'Why should I drag her about?' said Emely&aacute;n. 'She has a house

to live in.'



<P>At the King's palace they gave Emely&aacute;n work enough for two. He

began the job not hoping to finish it; but when evening came, lo

<BR>and behold! it was all done. The steward saw that it was finished,

and set him four times as much for next day.



<P>Emely&aacute;n went home. Everything there was swept and tidy; the oven

was heated, his supper was cooked and ready, and his wife

<BR>sat by the table sewing and waiting for his return. She greeted him,

laid the table, gave him to eat and drink, and then began to ask

<BR>him about his work.



<P>'Ah!' said he, 'it's a bad business: they give me tasks beyond my strength,

and want to kill me with work.'



<P>'Don't fret about the work,' said she, 'don't look either before or

behind to see how much you have done or how much there is left

<BR>to do; only keep on working and all will be right.'



<P>So Emely&aacute;n lay down and slept. Next morning he went to work again

and worked without once looking round. And, lo and behold!

<BR>by the evening it was all done, and before dark he came home for the

night.



<P>Again and again they increased Emely&aacute;n's work, but he always

got through it in good time and went back to his hut to sleep. A

<BR>week passed, and the King's servants saw they could not crush him with

rough work so they tried giving him work that required

<BR>skill. But this, also, was of no avail. Carpentering, and masonry,

and roofing, whatever they set him to do, Emely&aacute;n had it ready in

<BR>time, and went home to his wife at night. So a second week passed.



<P>Then the King called his servants and said: 'Am I to feed you for nothing?

Two weeks have gone, and I don't see that you have

<BR>done anything. You were going to tire Emely&aacute;n out with work,

but I see from my windows how he goes home every evening --

<BR>singing cheerfully! Do you mean to make a fool of me?'



<P>The King's servants began to excuse themselves. 'We tried our best to

wear him out with rough work,' they said, 'but nothing was

<BR>too hard for him; he cleared it all off as though he had swept it away

with a broom. There was no tiring him out. Then we set him

<BR>to tasks needing skill, which we did not think he was clever enough

to do, but he managed them all. No matter what one sets him,

<BR>he does it all, no one knows how. Either he or his wife must know some

spell that helps them. We ourselves are sick of him, and

<BR>wish to find a task he cannot master. We have now thought of setting

him to build a cathedral in a single day. Send for Emely&aacute;n,

<BR>and order him to build a cathedral in front of the palace in a single

day. Then, if he does not do it, let his head be cut off for

<BR>disobedience.'



<P>The King sent for Emely&aacute;n. 'Listen to my command,' said he: 'build

me a new cathedral on the square in front of my palace, and

<BR>have it ready by to-morrow evening. If you have it ready I will reward

you, but if not I will have your head cut off.'



<P>When Emely&aacute;n heard the King's command he turned away and went

home. 'My end is near,' thought he. And coming to his wife,

<BR>he said: 'Get ready, wife we must fly from here, or I shall be lost

by no fault of my own.'



<P>'What has frightened you so?' said she, 'and why should we run away?'



<P>'How can I help being frightened? The King has ordered me, to-morrow,

in a single day, to build him a cathedral. If I fail he will

<BR>cut my head off. There is only one thing to be done: we must fly while

there is yet time.'



<P>But his wife would not hear of it. 'The King has many soldiers,' said

she. 'They would catch us anywhere. We cannot escape from

<BR>him, but must obey him as long as strength holds out.'



<P>'How can I obey him when the task is beyond my strength?'



<P>'Eh, goodman, don't be downhearted. Eat your supper now, and go to sleep.

Rise early in the morning and all will get done.'



<P>So Emely&aacute;n lay down and slept. His wife roused him early next

day. 'Go quickly,' said she, 'and finish the cathedral. Here are nails

<BR>and a hammer; there is still enough work there for a day.'



<P>Emely&aacute;n went into the town, reached the palace square, and there

stood a large cathedral not quite finished. Emely&aacute;n set to work

<BR>to do what was needed, and by the evening all was ready.



<P>When the King awoke he looked out from his palace, and saw the cathedral,

and Emely&aacute;n going about driving in nails here and

<BR>there. And the King was not pleased to have the cathedral -- he was

annoyed at not being able to condemn Emely&aacute;n and take his

<BR>wife. Again he called his servants. 'Emely&aacute;n has done this task

also,' said the King, 'and there is no excuse for putting him to

<BR>death. Even this work was not too hard for him. You must find a more

cunning plan, or I will cut off your heads as well as his.'



<P>So his servants planned that Emely&aacute;n should be ordered to make

a river round the palace, with ships sailing on it. And the King

<BR>sent for Emely&aacute;n and set him this new task.



<P>'If,' said he, 'you could build a cathedral in one night, you can also

do this. To-morrow all must be ready. If not, I will have your

<BR>head off.'



<P>Emely&aacute;n was more downcast than before, and returned to his wife

sad at heart.



<P>'Why are you so sad?' said his wife. 'Has the King set you a fresh task?'



<P>Emely&aacute;n told her about it. 'We must fly,' said he.



<P>But his wife replied: 'There is no escaping the soldiers; they will

catch us wherever we go. There is nothing for it but to obey.'



<P>'How can I do it?' groaned Emely&aacute;n.



<P>'Eh! eh! goodman,' said she, 'don't be downhearted. Eat your supper

now, and go to sleep. Rise early, and all will get done in good

<BR>time.'



<P>So Emely&aacute;n lay down and slept. In the morning his wife woke him.

'Go,' said she 'to the palace -- all is ready. Only, near the

<BR>wharf in front of the palace, there is a mound left; take a spade and

level it.



<P>When the King awoke he saw a river where there had not been one; ships

were sailing up and down, and Emely&aacute;n was levelling a

<BR>mound with a spade. The King wondered, but was pleased neither with

the river nor with the ships, so vexed was he at not being

<BR>able to condemn Emely&aacute;n. 'There is no task,' thought he, 'that

he cannot manage. What is to be done?' And he called his servants

<BR>and again asked their advice.



<P>'Find some task,' said he, 'which Emely&aacute;n cannot compass. For

whatever we plan he fulfils, and I cannot take his wife from him.'



<P>The King's servants thought and thought, and at last devised a plan.

They came to the King and said: 'Send for Emely&aacute;n and say to

<BR>him: "Go to there, don't know where," and bring back "that, don't know

what." Then he will not be able to escape you. No matter

<BR>where he goes, you can say that he has not gone to the right place,

and no matter what he brings, you can say it is not the right

<BR>thing. Then you can have him beheaded and can take his wife.'



<P>The King was pleased. 'That is well thought of,' said he. So the King

sent for Emely&aacute;n and said to him: 'Go to "there, don't know

<BR>where," and bring back "that, don't know what." If you fail to bring

it, I will have you beheaded.'



<P>Emely&aacute;n returned to his wife and told her what the King had said.

His wife became thoughtful.



<P>'Well,' said she, 'they have taught the King how to catch you. Now we

must act warily.' So she sat and thought, and at last said to

<BR>her husband: 'You must go far, to our Grandam -- the old peasant woman,

the mother of soldiers -- and you must ask her aid. If

<BR>she helps you to anything, go straight to the palace with it, I shall

be there: I cannot escape them now. They will take me by force,

<BR>but it will not be for long. If you do everything as Grandam directs,

you will soon save me.'



<P>So the wife got her husband ready for the journey. She gave him a wallet,

and also a spindle. 'Give her this,' said she. 'By this

<BR>token she will know that you are my husband.' And his wife showed him

his road.



<P>Emely&aacute;n set off. He left the town behind, and came to where some

soldiers were being drilled. Emely&aacute;n stood and watched them.

<BR>After drill the soldiers sat down to rest. Then Emely&aacute;n went

up to them and asked: 'Do you know, brothers, the way to "there,

<BR>don't know where?" and how I can get "that, don't know what?"'



<P>The soldiers listened to him with surprise. 'Who sent you on this errand?'

said they



<P>'The King,' said he.



<P>'We ourselves,' said they, 'from the day we became soldiers, go we "don't

know where," and never yet have we got there; and we

<BR>seek we "don't know what," and cannot find it. We cannot help you.'



<P>Emely&aacute;n sat a while with the soldiers and then went on again.

He trudged many a mile, and at last came to a wood. In the wood

<BR>was a hut, and in the hut sat an old, old woman, the mother of peasant

soldiers, spinning flax and weeping. And as she spun she

<BR>did not put her fingers to her mouth to wet them with spittle, but

to her eyes to wet them with tears. When the old woman saw

<BR>Emely&aacute;n she cried out at him: 'Why have you come here?' Then

Emely&aacute;n gave her the spindle, and said his wife had sent it.



<P>The old woman softened at once, and began to question him. And Emely&aacute;n

told her his whole life: how he married the lass; how

<BR>they went to live in the town; how he had worked, and what he had done

at the palace; how he built the cathedral, and made a

<BR>river with ships on it, and how the King had now told him to go to

'there, don't know where, and bring back 'that, don't know what.'



<P>The Grandam listened to the end, and ceased weeping. She muttered to

herself: 'The time has surely come,' and said to him: 'All

<BR>right, my lad. Sit down now, and I will give you something to eat.'



<P>Emely&aacute;n ate, and then the Grandam told him what to do. 'Here,'

said she, 'is a ball of thread; roll it before you, and follow where it

<BR>goes. You must go far till you come right to the sea. When you get

there you will see a great city. Enter the city and ask for a

<BR>night's lodging at the furthest house. There look out for what you

are seeking.'



<P>'How shall I know it when I see it, Granny?' said he.



<P>'When you see something men obey more than father or mother, that is

it. Seize that, and take it to the King. When you bring it to

<BR>the King, he will say it is not right, and you must answer: "If it

is not the right thing it must be smashed," and you must beat it, and

<BR>carry it to the river, break it in pieces, and throw it into the water.

Then you will get your wife back and my tears will be dried.'



<P>Emely&aacute;n bade farewell to the Grandam and began rolling his ball

before him. It rolled and rolled until at last it reached the sea. By

<BR>the sea stood a great city, and at the further end of the city was

a big house. There Emely&aacute;n begged for a night's lodging, and was

<BR>granted it. He lay down to sleep, and in the morning awoke and heard

a father rousing his son to go and cut wood for the fire. But

<BR>the son did not obey. 'It is too early,' said he, 'there is time enough.'

Then Emely&aacute;n heard the mother say, 'Go, my son, your

<BR>father's bones ache; would you have him go himself? It is time to be

up!'



<P>But the son only murmured some words and fell asleep again. Hardly was

he asleep when something thundered and rattled in the

<BR>street. Up jumped the son and quickly putting on his clothes ran out

into the street. Up jumped Emely&aacute;n, too, and ran after him to

<BR>see what it was that a son obeys more than father or mother. What he

saw was a man walking along the street carrying, tied to

<BR>his stomach, a thing which he beat with sticks, and that it was that

rattled and thundered so, and that the son had obeyed. Emely&aacute;n

<BR>ran up and had a look at it. He saw it was round, like a small tub,

with a skin stretched over both ends, and he asked what it was

<BR>called.



<P>He was told, 'A drum.'



<P>'And is it empty?'



<P>'Yes, it is empty.'



<P>Emely&aacute;n was surprised. He asked them to give the thing to him,

but they would not. So Emely&aacute;n left off asking, and followed the

<BR>drummer. All day he followed, and when the drummer at last lay down

to sleep, Emely&aacute;n snatched the drum from him and ran

<BR>away with it.



<P>He ran and ran, till at last he got back to his own town. He went to

see his wife, but she was not at home. The day after he went

<BR>away, the King had taken her. So Emely&aacute;n went to the palace,

and sent in a message to the King: 'He has returned who went to

<BR>"there, don't know where," and he has brought with him "that, don't

know what."'



<P>They told the King, and the King said he was to come again next day.



<P>But Emely&aacute;n said, 'Tell the King I am here to-day, and have brought

what the King wanted. Let him come out to me, or I will go

<BR>in to him!'



<P>The King came out. 'Where have you been?' said he.



<P>Emely&aacute;n told him.



<P>'That's not the right place,' said the King. 'What have you brought?'



<P>Emely&aacute;n pointed to the drum, but the King did not look at it.



<P>'That is not it.'



<P>'If it is not the right thing,' said Emely&aacute;n, 'it must be smashed,

and may the devil take it!'



<P>And Emely&aacute;n left the palace, carrying the drum and beating it.

And as he beat it all the King's army ran out to follow Emely&aacute;n,

<BR>and they saluted him and waited his commands.



<P>The King, from his window, began to shout at his army telling them not

to follow Emely&aacute;n. They did not listen to what he said, but

<BR>all followed Emely&aacute;n.



<P>When the King saw that, he gave orders that Emely&aacute;n's wife should

be taken back to him, and he sent to ask Emely&aacute;n to give him

<BR>the drum.



<P>'It can't be done,' said Emely&aacute;n. 'I was told to smash it and

to throw the splinters into the river.'



<P>So Emely&aacute;n went down to the river carrying the drum, and the

soldiers followed him. When he reached the river bank Emely&aacute;n

<BR>smashed the drum to splinters, and threw the splinters into the stream.

And then all the soldiers ran away.



<P>Emely&aacute;n took his wife and went home with her. And after that

the King ceased to trouble him; and so they lived happily ever

<BR>after.

<P>AN OLD LEGEND CURRENT IN THE VOLGA DISTRICT



<P>'And in praying use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do: for they

think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not

<BR>therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have

need of, before ye ask Him.' -- Matt. vi. 7, 8.



<P>A BISHOP was sailing from Archangel to the Solov&eacute;tsk Monastery;

and on the same vessel were a number of pilgrims on their

<BR>way to visit the shrines at that place. The voyage was a smooth one.

The wind favourable, and the weather fair. The pilgrims lay

<BR>on deck, eating, or sat in groups talking to one another. The Bishop,

too, came on deck, and as he was pacing up and down, he

<BR>noticed a group of men standing near the prow and listening to a fisherman

who was pointing to the sea and telling them

<BR>something. The Bishop stopped, and looked in the direction in which

the man was pointing. He could see nothing however, but the

<BR>sea glistening in the sunshine. He drew nearer to listen, but when

the man saw him, he took off his cap and was silent. The rest of

<BR>the people also took off their caps, and bowed.



<P>'Do not let me disturb you, friends,' said the Bishop. 'I came to hear

what this good man was saying.'



<P>'The fisherman was telling us about the hermits,' replied one, a tradesman,

rather bolder than the rest.



<P>'What hermits?' asked the Bishop, going to the side of the vessel and

seating himself on a box. 'Tell me about them. I should like to

<BR>hear. What were you pointing at?'



<P>'Why, that little island you can just see over there,' answered the

man, pointing to a spot ahead and a little to the right. 'That is the

<BR>island where the hermits live for the salvation of their souls.'



<P>'Where is the island?' asked the Bishop. 'I see nothing.'



<P>'There, in the distance, if you will please look along my hand. Do you

see that little cloud? Below it and a bit to the left, there is just

<BR>a faint streak. That is the island.'



<P>The Bishop looked carefully, but his unaccustomed eyes could make out

nothing but the water shimmering in the sun.



<P>'I cannot see it,' he said. 'But who are the hermits that live there?'



<P>'They are holy men,' answered the fisherman. 'I had long heard tell

of them, but never chanced to see them myself till the year

<BR>before last.'



<P>And the fisherman related how once, when he was out fishing, he had

been stranded at night upon that island, not knowing where

<BR>he was. In the morning, as he wandered about the island, he came across

an earth hut, and met an old man standing near it.

<BR>Presently two others came out, and after having fed him, and dried

his things, they helped him mend his boat.



<P>'And what are they like?' asked the Bishop.



<P>'One is a small man and his back is bent. He wears a priest's cassock

and is very old; he must be more than a hundred, I should

<BR>say. He is so old that the white of his beard is taking a greenish

tinge, but he is always smiling, and his face is as bright as an

<BR>angel's from heaven. The second is taller, but he also is very old.

He wears tattered, peasant coat. His beard is broad, and of a

<BR>yellowish grey colour. He is a strong man. Before I had time to help

him, he turned my boat over as if it were only a pail. He too,

<BR>is kindly and cheerful. The third is tall, and has a beard as white

as snow and reaching to his knees. He is stern, with over-hanging

<BR>eyebrows; and he wears nothing but a mat tied round his waist.'



<P>'And did they speak to you?' asked the Bishop.



<P>'For the most part they did everything in silence and spoke but little

even to one another. One of them would just give a glance, and

<BR>the others would understand him. I asked the tallest whether they had

lived there long. He frowned, and muttered something as if

<BR>he were angry; but the oldest one took his hand and smiled, and then

the tall one was quiet. The oldest one only said: "Have mercy

<BR>upon us," and smiled.'



<P>While the fisherman was talking, the ship had drawn nearer to the island.



<P>'There, now you can see it plainly, if your Grace will please to look,'

said the tradesman, pointing with his hand.



<P>The Bishop looked, and now he really saw a dark streak -- which was

the island. Having looked at it a while, he left the prow of

<BR>the vessel, and going to the stern, asked the helmsman:



<P>'What island is that?'



<P>'That one,' replied the man, 'has no name. There are many such in this

sea.'



<P>'Is it true that there are hermits who live there for the salvation

of their souls?'



<P>'So it is said, your Grace, but I don't know if it's true. Fishermen

say they have seen them; but of course they may only be spinning

<BR>yarns.'



<P>'I should like to land on the island and see these men,' said the Bishop.

'How could I manage it?'



<P>'The ship cannot get close to the island,' replied the helmsman, 'but

you might be rowed there in a boat. You had better speak to

<BR>the captain.'



<P>The captain was sent for and came.



<P>'I should like to see these hermits,' said the Bishop. 'Could I not

be rowed ashore?'



<P>The captain tried to dissuade him.



<P>'Of course it could be done,' said he, 'but we should lose much time.

And if I might venture to say so to your Grace, the old men

<BR>are not worth your pains. I have heard say that they are foolish old

fellows, who understand nothing, and never speak a word, any

<BR>more than the fish in the sea.'



<P>'I wish to see them,' said the Bishop, 'and I will pay you for your

trouble and loss of time. Please let me have a boat.'



<P>There was no help for it; so the order was given. The sailors trimmed

the sails, the steersman put up the helm, and the ship's

<BR>course was set for the island. A chair was placed at the prow for the

Bishop, and he sat there, looking ahead. The passengers all

<BR>collected at the prow, and gazed at the island. Those who had the sharpest

eyes could presently make out the rocks on it, and then

<BR>a mud hut was seen. At last one man saw the hermits themselves. The

captain brought a telescope and, after looking through it,

<BR>handed it to the Bishop.



<P>'It's right enough. There are three men standing on the shore. There,

a little to the right of that big rock.'



<P>The Bishop took the telescope, got it into position, and he saw the

three men: a tall one, a shorter one, and one very small and bent,

<BR>standing on the shore and holding each other by the hand.



<P>The captain turned to the Bishop.



<P>'The vessel can get no nearer in than this, your Grace. If you wish

to go ashore, we must ask you to go in the boat, while we

<BR>anchor here.'



<P>The cable was quickly let out, the anchor cast, and the sails furled.

There was a jerk, and the vessel shook. Then a boat having

<BR>been lowered, the oarsmen jumped in, and the Bishop descended the ladder

and took his seat. The men pulled at their oars, and the

<BR>boat moved rapidly towards the island. When they came within a stone's

throw they saw three old men: a tall one with only a mat

<BR>tied round his waist: a shorter one in a tattered peasant coat, and

a very old one bent with age and wearing an old cassock -- all

<BR>three standing hand in hand.



<P>The oarsmen pulled in to the shore, and held on with the boathook while

the Bishop got out.



<P>The old men bowed to him, and he gave them his benediction, at which

they bowed still lower. Then the Bishop began to speak to

<BR>them.



<P>'I have heard,' he said, 'that you, godly men, live here saving your

own souls, and praying to our Lord Christ for your fellow men. I,

<BR>an unworthy servant of Christ, am called, by God's mercy, to keep and

teach His flock. I wished to see you, servants of God, and

<BR>to do what I can to teach you, also.'



<P>The old men looked at each other smiling, but remained silent.



<P>'Tell me,' said the Bishop, 'what you are doing to save your souls,

and how you serve God on this island.'



<P>The second hermit sighed, and looked at the oldest, the very ancient

one. The latter smiled, and said:



<P>'We do not know how to serve God. We only serve and support ourselves,

servant of God.'



<P>'But how do you pray to God?' asked the Bishop.



<P>'We pray in this way,' replied the hermit. 'Three are ye, three are

we, have mercy upon us.'



<P>And when the old man said this, all three raised their eyes to heaven,

and repeated:



<P>'Three are ye, three are we, have mercy upon us!'



<P>The Bishop smiled.



<P>'You have evidently heard something about the Holy Trinity,' said he.

'But you do not pray aright. You have won my affection,

<BR>godly men. I see you wish to please the Lord, but you do not know how

to serve Him. That is not the way to pray; but listen to me,

<BR>and I will teach you. I will teach you, not a way of my own, but the

way in which God in the Holy Scriptures has commanded all

<BR>men to pray to Him.'



<P>And the Bishop began explaining to the hermits how God had revealed

Himself to men; telling them of God the Father, and God

<BR>the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.



<P>'God the Son came down on earth,' said he, 'to save men, and this is

how He taught us all to pray. Listen and repeat after me:

<BR>"Our Father."'



<P>And the first old man repeated after him, 'Our Father,' and the second

said, 'Our Father,' and the third said, 'Our Father.'



<P>'Which art in heaven,' continued the Bishop.



<P>The first hermit repeated, 'Which art in heaven,' but the second blundered

over the words, and the tall hermit could not say them

<BR>properly. His hair had grown over his mouth so that he could not speak

plainly. The very old hermit, having no teeth, also mumbled

<BR>indistinctly.



<P>The Bishop repeated the words again, and the old men repeated them after

him. The Bishop sat down on a stone, and the old men

<BR>stood before him, watching his mouth, and repeating the words as he

uttered them. And all day long the Bishop laboured, saying a

<BR>word twenty, thirty, a hundred times over, and the old men repeated

it after him. They blundered, and he corrected them, and

<BR>made them begin again.



<P>The Bishop did not leave off till he had taught them the whole of the

Lord's prayer so that they could not only repeat it after him,

<BR>but could say it by themselves. The middle one was the first to know

it, and to repeat the whole of it alone. The Bishop made him

<BR>say it again and again, and at last the others could say it too.



<P>It was getting dark, and the moon was appearing over the water, before

the Bishop rose to return to the vessel. When he took

<BR>leave of the old men, they all bowed down to the ground before him.

He raised them, and kissed each of them, telling them to pray

<BR>as he had taught them. Then he got into the boat and returned to the

ship.



<P>And as he sat in the boat and was rowed to the ship he could hear the

three voices of the hermits loudly repeating the Lord's

<BR>prayer. As the boat drew near the vessel their voices could no longer

be heard, but they could still be seen in the moonlight,

<BR>standing as he had left them on the shore, the shortest in the middle,

the tallest on the right, the middle one on the left. As soon as

<BR>the Bishop had reached the vessel and got on board, the anchor was

weighed and the sails unfurled. The wind filled them, and the

<BR>ship sailed away, and the Bishop took a seat in the stern and watched

the island they had left. For a time he could still see the

<BR>hermits, but presently they disappeared from sight, though the island

was still visible. At last it too vanished, and only the sea was

<BR>to be seen, rippling in the moonlight.



<P>The pilgrims lay down to sleep, and all was quiet on deck. The Bishop

did not wish to sleep, but sat alone at the stern, gazing at the

<BR>sea where the island was no longer visible, and thinking of the good

old men. He thought how pleased they had been to learn the

<BR>Lord's prayer; and he thanked God for having sent him to teach and

help such godly men.



<P>So the Bishop sat, thinking, and gazing at the sea where the island

had disappeared. And the moonlight flickered before his eyes,

<BR>sparkling, now here, now there, upon the waves. Suddenly he saw something

white and shining, on the bright path which the moon

<BR>cast across the sea. Was it a seagull, or the little gleaming sail

of some small boat? The Bishop fixed his eyes on it, wondering.



<P>'It must be a boat sailing after us,' thought he 'but it is overtaking

us very rapidly. It was far, far away a minute ago, but now it is

<BR>much nearer. It cannot be a boat, for I can see no sail; but whatever

it may be, it is following us, and catching us up.'



<P>And he could not make out what it was. Not a boat, nor a bird, nor a

fish! It was too large for a man, and besides a man could not

<BR>be out there in the midst of the sea. The Bishop rose, and said to

the helmsman:



<P>'Look there, what is that, my friend? What is it?' the Bishop repeated,

though he could now see plainly what it was -- the three

<BR>hermits running upon the water, all gleaming white, their grey beards

shining, and approaching the ship as quickly as though it were

<BR>not morning.



<P>The steersman looked and let go the helm in terror.



<P>'Oh Lord! The hermits are running after us on the water as though it

were dry land!'



<P>The passengers hearing him, jumped up, and crowded to the stern. They

saw the hermits coming along hand in hand, and the two

<BR>outer ones beckoning the ship to stop. All three were gliding along

upon the water without moving their feet. Before the ship could

<BR>be stopped, the hermits had reached it, and raising their heads, all

three as with one voice, began to say:



<P>'We have forgotten your teaching, servant of God. As long as we kept

repeating it we remembered, but when we stopped saying it

<BR>for a time, a word dropped out, and now it has all gone to pieces.

We can remember nothing of it. Teach us again.'



<P>The Bishop crossed himself, and leaning over the ship's side, said:



<P>'Your own prayer will reach the Lord, men of God. It is not for me to

teach you. Pray for us sinners.



<P>And the Bishop bowed low before the old men; and they turned and went

back across the sea. And a light shone until daybreak on

<BR>the spot where they were lost to sight.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>IT was an early Easter. Sledging was only just over; snow still lay

in the yards; and water ran in streams down the village street.



<P>Two little girls from different houses happened to meet in a lane between

two homesteads, where the dirty water after running

<BR>through the farm-yards had formed a large puddle. One girl was very

small, the other a little bigger. Their mothers had dressed

<BR>them both in new frocks. The little one wore a blue frock the other

a yellow print, and both had red kerchiefs on their heads. They

<BR>had just come from church when they met, and first they showed each

other their finery, and then they began to play. Soon the

<BR>fancy took them to splash about in the water, and the smaller one was

going to step into the puddle, shoes and all, when the elder

<BR>checked her:



<P>'Don't go in so, Mal&aacute;sha,' said she, 'your mother will scold

you. I will take off my shoes and stockings, and you take off yours.'



<P>They did so, and then, picking up their skirts, began walking towards

each other through the puddle. The water came up to

<BR>Mal&aacute;sha's ankles, and she said:



<P>'It is deep, Ako&uacute;lya, I'm afraid!'



<P>'Come on,' replied the other. 'Don't be frightened. It won't get any

deeper.'



<P>When they got near one another, Ako&uacute;lya said:



<P>'Mind, Mal&aacute;sha, don't splash. Walk carefully!'



<P>She had hardly said this, when Mal&aacute;sha plumped down her foot

so that the water splashed right on to Ako&uacute;lya's frock. The frock

<BR>was splashed, and so were Ako&uacute;lya's eyes and nose. When she

saw the stains on her frock, she was angry and ran after Mal&aacute;sha

<BR>to strike her. Mal&aacute;sha was frightened, and seeing that she had

got herself into trouble, she scrambled out of the puddle, and

<BR>prepared to run home. Just then Ako&uacute;lya's mother happened to

be passing, and seeing that her daughter's skirt was splashed, and

<BR>her sleeves dirty, she said:



<P>'You naughty, dirty girl, what have you been doing?'



<P>'Mal&aacute;sha did it on purpose,' replied the girl.



<P>At this Ako&uacute;lya's mother seized Mal&aacute;sha, and struck her

on the back of her neck. Mal&aacute;sha began to howl so that she could

be

<BR>heard all down the street. Her mother came out.



<P>'What are you beating my girl for?' said she; and began scolding her

neighbour. One word led to another and they had an angry

<BR>quarrel. The men came out and a crowd collected in the street, every

one shouting and no one listening. They all went on

<BR>quarrelling, till one gave another a push, and the affair had very

nearly come to blows, when Ako&uacute;lya's old grandmother, stepping

<BR>in among them, tried to calm them.



<P>'What are you thinking of, friends? Is it right to behave so? On a day

like this, too! It is a time for rejoicing, and not for such folly

<BR>as this.'



<P>They would not listen to the old woman and nearly knocked her off her

feet. And she would not have been able to quiet the

<BR>crowd, if it had not been for Ako&uacute;lya and Mal&aacute;sha themselves.

While the women were abusing each other, Ako&uacute;lya had wiped

<BR>the mud off her frock, and gone back to the puddle. She took a stone

and began scraping away the earth in front of the puddle to

<BR>make a channel through which the water could run out into the street.

Presently Mal&aacute;sha joined her, and with a chip of wood

<BR>helped her dig the channel. Just as the men were beginning to fight,

the water from the little girls' channel ran streaming into the

<BR>street towards the very place where the old woman was trying to pacify

the men. The girls followed it; one running each side of

<BR>the little stream.



<P>'Catch it, Mal&aacute;sha! Catch it!' shouted Ako&uacute;lya; while

Mal&aacute;sha could not speak for laughing.



<P>Highly delighted, and watching the chip float along on their stream,

the little girls ran straight into the group of men; and the old

<BR>woman, seeing them, said to the men:



<P>'Are you not ashamed of yourselves? To go fighting on account of these

lassies, when they themselves have forgotten all about it,

<BR>and are playing happily together. Dear little souls! They are wiser

than you!'



<P>The men looked at the little girls, and were ashamed, and, laughing

at themselves, went back each to his own home.



<P>'Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise

enter into the kingdom of heaven.'

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>'The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.

Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in

<BR>Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. Jesus saith unto

her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh when neither in

<BR>this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father. . . .

But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall

<BR>worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek

to be his worshippers.' -- John iv. 19-21, 23.



<P>THERE were once two old men who decided to go on a pilgrimage to worship

God at Jerusalem. One of them was a well-to-do

<BR>peasant named Ef&iacute;m Tar&aacute;sitch Shev&eacute;lef. The other,

Elisha B&oacute;drof, was not so well off.



<P>Ef&iacute;m was a staid man, serious and firm. He neither drank nor

smoked nor took snuff, and had never used bad language in his life.

<BR>He had twice served as village Elder, and when he left office his accounts

were in good order. He had a large family: two sons

<BR>and a married grandson, all living with him. He was hale, long-bearded

and erect, and it was only when he was past sixty that a

<BR>little grey began to show itself in his beard.



<P>Elisha was neither rich nor poor. He had formerly gone out carpentering,

but now that he was growing old he stayed at home and

<BR>kept bees. One of his sons had gone away to find work, the other was

living at home. Elisha was a kindly and cheerful old man. It

<BR>is true he drank sometimes, and he took snuff, and was fond of singing,

but he was a peaceable man, and lived on good terms with

<BR>his family and with his neighbours. He was short and dark, with a curly

beard, and, like his patron saint Elisha, he was quite

<BR>bald-headed.



<P>The two old men had taken a vow long since and had arranged to go on

a pilgrimage to Jerusalem together: but Ef&iacute;m could never

<BR>spare the time; he always had so much business on hand; as soon as

one thing was finished he started another. First he had to

<BR>arrange his grandson's marriage; then to wait for his youngest son's

return from the army, and after that he began building a new

<BR>hut.



<P>One holiday the two old men met outside the hut and, sitting down on

some timber, began to talk.



<P>'Well,' asked Elisha, 'when are we to fulfil our vow?'



<P>Ef&iacute;m made a wry face.



<P>'We must wait,' he said. 'This year has turned out a hard one for me.

I started building this hut thinking it would cost me something

<BR>over a hundred roubles, but now it's getting on for three hundred and

it's still not finished. We shall have to wait tin the summer. In

<BR>summer, God willing, we will go without fail.'



<P>'It seems to me we ought not to put it off, but should go at once,'

said Elisha. 'Spring is the best time.'



<P>'The time's right enough, but what about my building? How can I leave

that?'



<P>'As if you had no one to leave in charge! Your son can look after it.'



<P>'But how? My eldest son is not trustworthy -- he sometimes takes a glass

too much.'



<P>'Ah, neighbour, when we die they'll get on without us. Let your son

begin now to get some experience.'



<P>'That's true enough, but somehow when one begins a thing one likes to

see it done.'



<P>'Eh, friend, we can never get through all we have to do. The other day

the women-folk at home were washing and house cleaning

<BR>for Easter. Here something needed doing, there something else, and

they could not get everything done. So my eldest

<BR>daughter-in-law, who's a sensible woman, says: 'We may be thankful

the holiday comes without waiting for us, or however hard

<BR>we worked we should never be ready for it.'



<P>Ef&iacute;m became thoughtful.



<P>'I've spent a lot of money on this building,' he said 'and one can't

start on the journey with empty pockets. We shall want a hundred

<BR>roubles apiece -- and it's no small sum.'



<P>Elisha laughed.



<P>'Now, come, come, old friend!' he said, 'you have ten times as much

as I, and yet you talk about money. Only say when we are to

<BR>start, and though I have nothing now I shall have enough by then.'



<P>Ef&iacute;m also smiled.



<P>'Dear me, I did not know you were so rich!' said he. 'Why, where will

you get it from?'



<P>'I can scrape some together at home, and if that's not enough, I'll

sell half a score of hives to my neighbour. He's long been

<BR>wanting to buy them.'



<P>'If they swarm well this year, you'll regret it.'



<P>'Regret it! Not I, neighbour! I never regretted anything in my life,

except my sins. There's nothing more precious than the soul.'



<P>'That's so; still it's not right to neglect things at home.'



<P>'But what if our souls are neglected? That's worse. We took the vow,

so let us go! Now, seriously, let us go!'



<P>II



<P>Elisha succeeded in persuading his comrade. In the morning, after thinking

it well over, Ef&iacute;m came to Elisha.



<P>'You are right,' said he, 'let us go. Life and death are in God's hands.

We must go now, while we are still alive and have the

<BR>strength.'



<P>A week later the old men were ready to start. Ef&iacute;m had money

enough at hand. He took a hundred roubles himself, and left two

<BR>hundred with his wife.



<P>Elisha, too, got ready. He sold ten hives to his neighbour, with any

new swarms that might come from them before the summer.

<BR>He took seventy roubles for the lot. The rest of the hundred roubles

he scraped together from the other members of his household,

<BR>fairly clearing them all out. His wife gave him all she had been saving

up for her funeral; and his daughter-in-law also gave him

<BR>what she had.



<P>Ef&iacute;m gave his eldest son definite orders about every thing: when

and how much grass to mow, where to cart the manure, and how

<BR>to finish off and roof the cottage. He thought out everything, and

gave his orders accordingly. Elisha, on the other hand, only

<BR>explained to his wife that she was to keep separate the swarms from

the hives he had sold, and to be sure to let the neighbour

<BR>have them all, without any tricks. As to household affairs, he did

not even mention them.



<P>'You will see what to do and how to do it, as the needs arise,' he said.

'You are the masters, and will know how to do what's best

<BR>for yourselves.'



<P>So the old men got ready. Their people baked them cakes, and made bags

for them, and cut them linen for leg-bands[11]. They

<BR>put on new leather shoes, and took with them spare shoes of platted

bark. Their families went with them to the end of the village

<BR>and there took leave of them, and the old men started on their pilgrimage.



<P>Elisha left home in a cheerful mood, and as soon as he was out of the

village forgot all his home affairs. His only care was how to

<BR>please his comrade, how to avoid saying a rude word to any one, how

to get to his destination and home again in peace and love.

<BR>Walking along the road, Elisha would either whisper some prayer to

himself or go over in his mind such of the lives of the saints as

<BR>he was able to remember. When he came across any one on the road, or

turned in anywhere for the night, he tried to behave as

<BR>gently as possible and to say a godly word. So he journeyed on, rejoicing.

One thing only he could not do, he could not give up

<BR>taking snuff. Though he had left his snuff-box behind, he hankered

after it. Then a man he met on the road gave him some snuff;

<BR>and every now and then he would lag behind (not to lead his comrade

into temptation) and would take a pinch of snuff.



<P>Ef&iacute;m too walked well and firmly; doing no wrong and speaking

no vain words, but his heart was not so light. Household cares

<BR>weighed on his mind. He kept worrying about what was going on at home.

Had he not forgotten to give his son this or that order?

<BR>Would his son do things properly? If he happened to see potatoes being

planted or manure carted, as he went along, he wondered

<BR>if his son was doing as he had been told. And he almost wanted to turn

back and show him how to do things, or even do them

<BR>himself.



<P>III



<P>The old men had been walking for five weeks, they had worn out their

home-made bark shoes, and had to begin buying new ones

<BR>when they reached Little Russia[12]. From the time they left home they

had had to pay for their food and for their night's lodging,

<BR>but when they reached Little Russia the people vied with one another

in asking them into their huts. They took them in and fed

<BR>them, and would accept no payment; and more than that, they put bread

or even cakes into their bags for them to eat on the road.



<P>The old men travelled some five hundred miles in this manner free of

expense, but after they had crossed the next province, they

<BR>came to a district where the harvest had failed. The peasants still

gave them free lodging at night, but no longer fed them for

<BR>nothing. Sometimes, even, they could get no bread: they offered to

pay for it, but there was none to be had. The people said the

<BR>harvest had completely failed the year before. Those who had been rich

were ruined and had had to sell all they possessed; those

<BR>of moderate means were left destitute, and those of the poor who had

not left those parts, wandered about begging, or starved at

<BR>home in utter want. In the winter they had had to eat husks and goosefoot.



<P>One night the old men stopped in a small village; they bought fifteen

pounds of bread, slept there, and started before sunrise, to get

<BR>well on their way before the heat of the day. When they had gone some

eight miles, on coming to a stream they sat down, and,

<BR>filling a bowl with water, they steeped some bread in it, and ate it.

Then they changed their leg-bands, and rested for a while.

<BR>Elisha took out his snuff-box. Ef&iacute;m shook his head at him.



<P>'How is it you don't give up that nasty habit?' said he.



<P>Elisha waved his hand. 'The evil habit is stronger than I,' he said.



<P>Presently they got up and went on. After walking for nearly another

eight miles, they came to a large village and passed right

<BR>through it. It had now grown hot. Elisha was tired out and wanted to

rest and have a drink, but Ef&iacute;m did not stop. Ef&iacute;m was the

<BR>better walker of the two, and Elisha found it hard to keep up with

him.



<P>'If I could only have a drink,' said he.



<P>'Well, have a drink,' said Ef&iacute;m. 'I don't want any.'



<P>Elisha stopped.



<P>'You go on,' he said, 'but I'll just run in to the little hut there.

I will catch you up in a moment.'



<P>'All right,' said Ef&iacute;m, and he went on along the high road alone,

while Elisha turned back to the hut.



<P>It was a small hut plastered with clay, the bottom a dark colour, the

top whitewashed; but the clay had crumbled away. Evidently it

<BR>was long since it had been re-plastered, and the thatch was off the

roof on one side. The entrance to the hut was through the yard.

<BR>Elisha entered the yard, and saw, lying close to a bank of earth that

ran round the hut, a gaunt, beardless man with his shirt tucked

<BR>into his trousers, as is the custom in Little Russia[13]. The man must

have lain down in the shade, but the sun had come round and

<BR>now shone full on him. Though not asleep, he still lay there. Elisha

called to him, and asked for a drink, but the man gave no

<BR>answer.



<P>'He is either ill or unfriendly,' thought Elisha; and going to the door

he heard a child crying in the hut. He took hold of the ring that

<BR>served as a door-handle, and knocked with it.



<P>'Hey, masters!' he called. No answer. He knocked again with his staff.



<P>'Hey, Christians!' Nothing stirred.



<P>'Hey, servants of God!' Still no reply.



<P>Elisha was about to turn away, when he thought ho heard a groan the

other side of the door.



<P>'Dear me, some misfortune must have happened to the people? I had better

have a look.'



<P>And Elisha entered the hut.



<P>IV



<P>Elisha turned the ring; the door was not fastened. He opened it and

went along up the narrow passage. The door into the

<BR>dwelling-room was open. To the left was a brick oven; in front against

the wall was an icon-stand[14] and a table before it, by the

<BR>table was a bench on which sat an old woman, bareheaded and wearing

only a single garment. There she sat with her head resting

<BR>on the table, and near her was a thin, wax-coloured boy, with a protruding

stomach. He was asking for something, pulling at her

<BR>sleeve, and crying bitterly. Elisha entered. The air in the hut was

very foul. He looked round, and saw a woman lying on the floor

<BR>behind the oven: she lay flat on the ground with her eyes closed and

her throat rattling, now stretching out a leg, now dragging it in,

<BR>tossing from side to side; and the foul smell came from her. Evidently

she could do nothing for herself and no one had been

<BR>attending to her needs. The old woman lifted her head, and saw the

stranger.



<P>'What do you want?' said she.' What do you want man? We have nothing.'



<P>Elisha understood her, though she spoke in the Little-Russian dialect.



<P>'I came in for a drink of water, servant of God,' he said.



<P>'There's no one -- no one -- we have nothing to fetch it in. Go your

way.'



<P>Then Elisha asked:



<P>'Is there no one among you, then, well enough to attend to that woman?'



<P>'No, we have no one. My son is dying outside, and we are dying in here.'



<P>The little boy had ceased crying when he saw the stranger, but when

the old woman began to speak, he began again, and clutching

<BR>hold of her sleeve cried:



<P>'Bread, Granny, bread.'



<P>Elisha was about to question the old woman, when the man staggered into

the hut. He came along the passage, clinging to the

<BR>wall, but as he was entering the dwelling-room he fell in the corner

near the threshold, and without trying to get up again to reach

<BR>the bench, he began to speak in broken words. He brought out a word

at a time, stopping to draw breath, and gasping.



<P>'Illness has seized us . . . ,' said he, 'and famine. He is dying .

. . of hunger.'



<P>And he motioned towards the boy, and began to sob.



<P>Elisha jerked up the sack behind his shoulder and pulling the straps

off his arms, put it on the floor. Then he lifted it on to the

<BR>bench, and untied the strings. Having opened the sack, he took out

a loaf of bread, and, cutting off a piece with his knife, handed it

<BR>to the man. The man would not take it, but pointed to the little boy

and to a little girl crouching behind the oven, as if to say:



<P>'Give it to them.'



<P>Elisha held it out to the boy. When the boy smelt bread, he stretched

out his arms, and seizing the slice with both his little hands, bit

<BR>into it so that his nose disappeared in the chunk. The little girl

came out from behind the oven and fixed her eyes on the bread.

<BR>Elisha gave her also a slice. Then he cut off another piece and gave

it to the old woman, and she too began munching it.



<P>'If only some water could be brought,' she said, 'their mouths are parched.

I tried to fetch some water yesterday -- or was it to-day

<BR>-- I can't remember, but I fell down and could go no further, and the

pail has remained there, unless some one has taken it.'



<P>Elisha asked where the well was. The old woman told him. Elisha went

out, found the pail, brought some water, and gave the

<BR>people a drink. The children and the old woman ate some more bread

with the water, but the man would not eat.



<P>'I cannot eat,' he said.



<P>All this time the younger woman did not show any consciousness, but

continued to toss from side to side. Presently Elisha went to

<BR>the village shop and bought some millet, salt, flour, and oil. He found

an axe, chopped some wood, and made a fire. The little girl

<BR>came and helped him. Then he boiled some soup, and gave the starving

people a meal.



<P>V



<P>The man ate a little, the old woman had some too, and the little girl

and boy licked the bowl clean, and then curled up and fell fast

<BR>asleep in one another's arms.



<P>The man and the old woman then began telling Elisha how they had sunk

to their present state.



<P>'We were poor enough before?' said they, 'but when the crops failed,

what we gathered hardly lasted us through the autumn. We

<BR>had nothing left by the time winter came, and had to beg from the neighbours

and from any one we could. At first they gave, then

<BR>they began to refuse. Some would have been glad enough to help us,

but had nothing to give. And we were ashamed of asking: we

<BR>were in debt all round, and owed money, and flour, and bread.'



<P>'I went to look for work,' the man said, 'but could find none. Everywhere

people were offering to work merely for their own keep.

<BR>One day you'd get a short job, and then you might spend two days looking

for work. Then the old woman and the girl went

<BR>begging, further away. But they got very little; bread was so scarce.

Still we scraped food together somehow, and hoped to

<BR>struggle through till next harvest, but towards spring people ceased

to give anything. And then this illness seized us. Things became

<BR>worse and worse. One day we might have something to eat, and then nothing

for two days. We began eating grass. Whether it

<BR>was the grass, or what, made my wife ill, I don't know. She could not

keep on her legs, and I had no strength left, and there was

<BR>nothing to help us to recovery.'



<P>'I struggled on alone for a while,' said the old woman, 'but at last

I broke down too for want of food, and grew quite weak. The girl

<BR>also grew weak and timid. I told her to go to the neighbours -- she

would not leave the hut, but crept into a corner and sat there.

<BR>The day before yesterday a neighbour looked in, but seeing that we

were ill and hungry she turned away and left us. Her husband

<BR>has had to go away, and she has nothing for her own little ones to

eat. And so we lay, waiting for death.'



<P>Having heard their story, Elisha gave up the thought of overtaking his

comrade that day, and remained with them all night. In the

<BR>morning he got up and began doing the housework, just as if it were

his own home. He kneaded the bread with the old woman's

<BR>help, and lit the fire. Then he went with the little girl to the neighbours

to get the most necessary things, for there was nothing in

<BR>the hut: everything had been sold for bread -- cooking utensils, clothing,

and all. So Elisha began replacing what was necessary,

<BR>making some things himself, and buying some. He remained there one

day, then another, and then a third. The little boy picked up

<BR>strength and, whenever Elisha sat down, crept along the bench and nestled

up to him. The little girl brightened up and helped in all

<BR>the work, running after Elisha and calling,



<P>'Daddy, daddy.'



<P>The old woman grew stronger, and managed to go out to see a neighbour.

The man too improved, and was able to get about,

<BR>holding on to the wall. Only the wife could not get up, but even she

regained consciousness on the third day, and asked for food.



<P>'Well,' thought Elisha, 'I never expected to waste so much time on the

way. Now I must be getting on.'



<P>VI



<P>The fourth day was the feast day after the summer fast, and Elisha thought:



<P>'I will stay and break the fast with these people. I'll go and buy them

something, and keep the feast with them, and to-morrow

<BR>evening I will start.'



<P>So Elisha went into the village, bought milk, wheat-flour and dripping,

and helped the old woman to boil and bake for the morrow.

<BR>On the feast day Elisha went to church, and then broke the fast with

his friends at the hut. That day the wife got up, and managed

<BR>to move about a bit. The husband had shaved and put on a clean shirt,

which the old woman had washed for him; and he went to

<BR>beg for mercy of a rich peasant in the village to whom his ploughland

and meadow were mortgaged. He went to beg the rich

<BR>peasant to grant him the use of the meadow and field till after the

harvest; but in the evening he came back very sad, and began to

<BR>weep. The rich peasant had shown no mercy, but had said: 'Bring me

the money.'



<P>Elisha again grew thoughtful. 'How are they to live now?' thought he

to himself. 'Other people will go haymaking, but there will be

<BR>nothing for these to mow, their grass land is mortgaged. The rye will

ripen. Others will reap (and what a fine crop mother-earth is

<BR>giving this year), but they have nothing to look forward to. Their

three acres are pledged to the rich peasant. When I am gone,

<BR>they'll drift back into the state I found them in.'



<P>Elisha was in two minds, but finally decided not to leave that evening,

but to wait until the morrow. He went out into the yard to

<BR>sleep. He said his prayers, and lay down; but he could not sleep. On

the one hand he felt he ought to be going, for he had spent too

<BR>much time and money as it was; on the other hand he felt sorry for

the people.



<P>'There seems to be no end to it, he said. 'First I only meant to bring

them a little water and give them each a slice of bread: and

<BR>just see where it has landed me. It's a case of redeeming the meadow

and the cornfield. And when I have done that, I shall have

<BR>to buy a cow for them, and a horse for the man to cart his sheaves.

A nice coil you've got yourself into, brother Elisha! You've

<BR>slipped your cables and lost your reckoning!'



<P>Elisha got up, lifted his coat which he had been using for a pillow,

unfolded it, got out his snuff-box and took a pinch, thinking that it

<BR>might perhaps clear his thoughts.



<P>But no! He thought and thought, and came to no conclusion. He ought

to be going; and yet pity held him back. He did not know

<BR>what to do. He refolded his coat and put it under his head again. He

lay thus for a long time, till the cocks had already crowed

<BR>once: then he was quite drowsy. And suddenly it seemed as if some one

had roused him. He saw that he was dressed for the

<BR>journey, with the sack on his back and the staff in his hand, and the

gate stood ajar so that he could just squeeze through. He was

<BR>about to pass out, when his sack caught against the fence on one side:

he tried to free it, but then his leg-band caught on the other

<BR>side and came undone. He pulled at the sack, and saw that it had not

caught on the fence, but that the little girl was holding it and

<BR>crying,



<P>'Bread, daddy, bread!'



<P>He looked at his foot, and there was the tiny boy holding him by the

leg-band, while the master of the hut and the old woman were

<BR>looking at him through the window.



<P>Elisha awoke, and said to himself in an audible voice:



<P>'To-morrow I will redeem their cornfield, and will buy them a horse,

and flour to last till the harvest, and a cow for the little ones;

<BR>or else while I go to seek the Lord beyond the sea, I may lose Him

in myself.'



<P>Then Elisha fell asleep, and slept till morning. He awoke early, and

going to the rich peasant, redeemed both the cornfield and the

<BR>meadow land. He bought a scythe (for that also had been sold) and brought

it back with him. Then he sent the man to mow, and

<BR>himself went into the village. He heard that there was a horse and

cart for sale at the public-house, and he struck a bargain with

<BR>the owner, and bought them. Then he bought a sack of flour, put it

in the cart, and went to see about a cow. As he was going

<BR>along he overtook two women talking as they went. Though they spake

the Little-Russian dialect, he understood what they were

<BR>saying.



<P>'At first, it seems, they did not know him; they thought he was just

an ordinary man. He came in to ask for a drink of water, and

<BR>then he remained. Just think of the things he has bought for them!

Why they say he bought a horse and cart for them at the

<BR>publican's, only this morning! There are not many such men in the world.

It's worth while going to have a look at him.'



<P>Elisha heard and understood that he was being praised, and he did not

go to buy the cow, but returned to the inn, paid for the

<BR>horse, harnessed it, drove up to the hut, and got out. The people in

the hut were astonished when they saw the horse. They thought

<BR>it might be for them, but dared not ask. The man came out to open the

gate.



<P>'Where did you get a horse from, grandfather,' he asked.



<P>'Why, I bought it,' said Elisha. 'It was going cheap. Go and cut some

grass and put it in the manger for it to eat during the night.

<BR>And take in the sack.'



<P>The man unharnessed the horse, and carried the sack into the barn. Then

he mowed some grass and put it in the manger.

<BR>Everybody lay down to sleep. Elisha went outside and lay by the roadside.

That evening he took his bag out with him. When every

<BR>one was asleep, he got up, packed and fastened his bag, wrapped the

linen bands round his legs, put on his shoes and coat, and set

<BR>off to follow Ef&iacute;m.



<P>VII



<P>When Elisha had walked rather more than three miles it began to grow

light. He sat down under a tree, opened his bag, counted

<BR>his money, and found he had only seventeen roubles and twenty kopeks

left.



<P>'Well,' thought he, 'it is no use trying to cross the sea with this.

If I beg my way it may be worse than not going at all. Friend Ef&iacute;m

<BR>will get to Jerusalem without me, and will place a candle at the shrines

in my name. As for me, I'm afraid I shall never fulfil my

<BR>vow in this life. I must be thankful it was made to a merciful Master,

and to one who pardons sinners.'



<P>Elisha rose, jerked his bag well up on his shoulders, and turned back.

Not wishing to be recognized by any one, he made a circuit

<BR>to avoid the village, and walked briskly homeward. Coming from home

the way had seemed difficult to him, and he had found it

<BR>hard to keep up with Ef&iacute;m, but now on his return journey, God

helped him to get over the ground so that he hardly felt fatigue.

<BR>Walking seemed like child's play. He went along swinging his staff,

and did his forty to fifty miles a day.



<P>When Elisha reached home the harvest was over. His family were delighted

to see him again, and all wanted to know what had

<BR>happened: Why and how he had been left behind? And why he had returned

without reaching Jerusalem? But Elisha did not tell

<BR>them.



<P>'It was not God's will that I should get there,' said he. 'I lost my

money on the way, and lagged behind my companion. Forgive me,

<BR>for the Lord's sake!'



<P>Elisha gave his old wife what money he had left. Then he questioned

them about home affairs. Everything was going on well; all

<BR>the work had been done, nothing neglected, and all were living in peace

and concord.



<P>Ef&iacute;m's family heard of his return the same day, and came for

news of their old man; and to them Elisha gave the same answers.



<P>'Ef&iacute;m is a fast walker. We parted three days before St. Peter's

day, and I meant to catch him up again, but all sorts of things

<BR>happened. I lost my money, and had no means to get any further, so

I turned back.'



<P>The folks were astonished that so sensible a man should have acted so

foolishly: should have started and not got to his destination,

<BR>and should have squandered all his money. They wondered at it for a

while, and then forgot all about it, and Elisha forgot it too. He

<BR>set to work again on his homestead. With his son's help he cut wood

for fuel for the winter. He and the women threshed the corn.

<BR>Then he mended the thatch on the outhouses, put the bees under cover,

and handed over to his neighbour the ten hives he had sold

<BR>him in spring, and all the swarms that had come from them. His wife

tried not to tell how many swarms there had been from these

<BR>hives, but Elisha knew well enough from which there had been swarms

and from which not. And instead of ten, he handed over

<BR>seventeen swarms to his neighbour. Having got everything ready for

the winter, Elisha sent his son away to find work, while he

<BR>himself took to platting shoes of bark, and hollowing out logs for

hives.



<P>VIII



<P>All that day while Elisha stopped behind in the hut with the sick people,

Ef&iacute;m waited for him. He only went on a little way before

<BR>he sat down. He waited and waited, had a nap, woke up again, and again

sat waiting; but his comrade did not come. He gazed till

<BR>his eyes ached. The sun was already sinking behind a tree, and still

no Elisha was to be seen.



<P>'Perhaps he has passed me,' thought Ef&iacute;m, 'or perhaps some one

gave him a lift and he drove by while I slept, and did not see me.

<BR>But how could he help seeing me? One can see so far here in the steppe.

Shall I go back? Suppose he is on in front, we shall then

<BR>miss each other completely and it will be still worse. I had better

go on, and we shall be sure to meet where we put up for the

<BR>night.'



<P>He came to a village, and told the watchman, if an old man of a certain

description came along, to bring him to the hut where Ef&iacute;m

<BR>stopped. But Elisha did not turn up that night. Ef&iacute;m went on,

asking all he met whether they had not seen a little, bald-headed, old

<BR>man? No one had seen such a traveller. Ef&iacute;m wondered, but went

on alone, saying:



<P>'We shall be sure to meet in Odessa, or on board the ship,' and he did

not trouble more about it.



<P>On the way, he came across a pilgrim wearing a priest's coat, with long

hair and a skull-cap such as priests wear. This pilgrim had

<BR>been to Mount Athos, and was now going to Jerusalem for the second

time. They both stopped at the same place one night, and,

<BR>having met, they travelled on together.



<P>They got safely to Odessa, and there had to wait three days for a ship.

Many pilgrims from many different parts were in the same

<BR>case. Again Ef&iacute;m asked about Elisha, but no one had seen him.



<P>Ef&iacute;m got himself a foreign passport, which cost him five roubles.

He paid forty roubles for a return ticket to Jerusalem, and bought

<BR>a supply of bread and herrings for the voyage.



<P>The pilgrim began explaining to Ef&iacute;m how he might get on to the

ship without paying his fare; but Ef&iacute;m would not listen. 'No, I

<BR>came prepared to pay, and I shall pay,' said he.



<P>The ship was freighted, and the pilgrims went on board, Ef&iacute;m

and his new comrade among them. The anchors were weighed, and

<BR>the ship put out to sea.



<P>All day they sailed smoothly, but towards night a wind arose, rain came

on, and the vessel tossed about and shipped water. The

<BR>people were frightened: the women wailed and screamed, and some of

the weaker men ran about the ship looking for shelter.

<BR>Ef&iacute;m too was frightened, but he would not show it, and remained

at the place on deck where he had settled down when first he

<BR>came on board, beside some old men from Tamb&oacute;f. There they sat

silent, all night and all next day, holding on to their sacks. On

<BR>the third day it grew calm, and on the fifth day they anchored at Constantinople.

Some of the pilgrims went on shore to visit the

<BR>Church of St. Sophia, now held by the Turks. Ef&iacute;m remained on

the ship, and only bought some white bread. They lay there for

<BR>twenty-four hours, and then put to sea again. At Smyrna they stopped

again; and at Alexandria; but at last they arrived safely at

<BR>Jaffa, where all the pilgrims had to disembark. From there still it

was more than forty miles by road to Jerusalem. When

<BR>disembarking the people were again much frightened. The ship was high,

and the people were dropped into boats, which rocked so

<BR>much that it was easy to miss them and fall into the water. A couple

of men did get a wetting, but at last all were safely landed.



<P>They went on on foot, and at noon on the third day reached Jerusalem.

They stopped outside the town, at the Russian inn, where

<BR>their passports were indorsed. Then, after dinner, Ef&iacute;m visited

the Holy Places with his companion, the pilgrim. It was not the time

<BR>when they could be admitted to the Holy Sepulchre, but they went to

the Patriarchate. All the pilgrims assembled there. The

<BR>women were separated from the men, who were all told to sit in a circle,

barefoot. Then a monk came in with a towel to wash

<BR>their feet. He washed, wiped, and then kissed their feet, and did this

to every one in the circle. Ef&iacute;m's feet were washed and

<BR>kissed, with the rest. He stood through vespers and matins, prayed,

placed candles at the shrines, handed in booklets inscribed with

<BR>his parents, names, that they might be mentioned in the church prayers.

Here at the Patriarchate food and wine were given them.

<BR>Next morning they went to the cell of Mary of Egypt, where she had

lived doing penance. Here too they placed candles and had

<BR>prayers read. From there they went to Abraham's Monastery, and saw

the place where Abraham intended to slay his son as an

<BR>offering to God. Then they visited the spot where Christ appeared to

Mary Magdalene, and the Church of James, the Lord's

<BR>brother. The pilgrim showed Ef&iacute;m all these places, and told

him how much money to give at each place. At mid-day they returned

<BR>to the inn and had dinner. As they were preparing to lie down and rest,

the pilgrim cried out, and began to search his clothes,

<BR>feeling them all over.



<P>'My purse has been stolen, there were twenty-three roubles in it,' said

he, 'two ten-rouble notes and the rest in change.'



<P>He sighed and lamented a great deal, but as there was no help for it,

they lay down to sleep.



<P>IX



<P>As Ef&iacute;m lay there, he was assailed by temptation.



<P>'No one has stolen any money from this pilgrim,' thought he, 'I do not

believe he had any. He gave none away anywhere, though

<BR>he made me give, and even borrowed a rouble of me.'



<P>This thought had no sooner crossed his mind, than Ef&iacute;m rebuked

himself, saying: 'What right have I to judge a man? It is a sin. I

<BR>will think no more about it.' But as soon as his thoughts began to

wander, they turned again to the pilgrim: how interested he

<BR>seemed to be in money, and how unlikely it sounded when he declared

that his purse had been stolen.



<P>'He never had any money,' thought Ef&iacute;m. 'It's all an invention.'



<P>Towards evening they got up, and went to midnight Mass at the great

Church of the Resurrection, where the Lord's Sepulchre is.

<BR>The pilgrim kept close to Ef&iacute;m and went with him everywhere.

They came to the Church; a great many pilgrims were there; some

<BR>Russians and some of other nationalities: Greeks, Armenians, Turks,

and Syrians. Ef&iacute;m entered the Holy Gates with the crowd. A

<BR>monk led them past the Turkish sentinels, to the place where the Saviour

was taken down from the cross and anointed, and where

<BR>candles were burning in nine great candlesticks. The monk showed and

explained everything. Ef&iacute;m offered a candle there. Then

<BR>the monk led Ef&iacute;m to the right, up the steps to Golgotha, to

the place where the cross had stood. Ef&iacute;m prayed there. Then they

<BR>showed him the cleft where the ground had been rent asunder to its

nethermost depths; then the place where Christ's hands and

<BR>feet were nailed to the cross; then Adam's tomb, where the blood of

Christ had dripped on to Adam's bones. Then they showed

<BR>him the stone on which Christ sat when the crown of thorns was placed

on His head; then the post to which Christ was bound

<BR>when He was scourged. Then Ef&iacute;m saw the stone with two holes

for Christ's feet. They were going to show him something else,

<BR>but there was a stir in the crowd, and the people all hurried to the

church of the Lord's Sepulchre itself. The Latin Mass had just

<BR>finished there, and the Russian Mass was beginning. And Ef&iacute;m

went with the crowd to the tomb cut in the rock.



<P>He tried to get rid of the pilgrim, against whom he was still sinning

in his mind, but the pilgrim would not leave him, but went with

<BR>him to the Mass at the Holy Sepulchre. They tried to get to the front,

but were too late. There was such a crowd that it was

<BR>impossible to move either backwards or forwards. Ef&iacute;m stood

looking in front of him, praying, and every now and then feeling for

<BR>his purse. He was in two minds: sometimes he thought that the pilgrim

was deceiving him, and then again he thought that if the

<BR>pilgrim spoke the truth and his purse had really been stolen, the same

thing might happen to himself.



<P>X



<P>Ef&iacute;m stood there gazing into the little chapel in which was the

Holy Sepulchre itself with thirty-six lamps burning above it. As he

<BR>stood looking over the people's heads, he saw something that surprised

him. Just beneath the lamps in which the sacred fire burns

<BR>and in front of every one, Ef&iacute;m saw an old man in a grey coat,

whose bald, shining head was just like Elisha B&oacute;drof.



<P>'It is like him,' thought Ef&iacute;m, 'but it cannot be Elisha. He

could not have got ahead of me. The ship before ours started a week

<BR>sooner. He could not have caught that; and he was not on ours, for

I saw every pilgrim on board.'



<P>Hardly had Ef&iacute;m thought this, when the little old man began to

pray, and bowed three times: once forwards to God, then once on

<BR>each side -- to the brethren. And as he turned his head to the right,

Ef&iacute;m recognized him. It was Elisha B&oacute;drof himself with his

<BR>dark, curly beard turning grey at the cheeks, with his brows, his eyes

and nose, and his expression of face. Yes, it was he!



<P>Ef&iacute;m was very pleased to have found his comrade again, and wondered

how Elisha had got ahead of him.



<P>'Well done, Elisha!' thought he. 'See how he has pushed ahead. He must

have come across some one who showed him the way.

<BR>When we get out, I will find him, get rid of this fellow in the skull-cap,

and keep to Elisha. Perhaps he will show me how to get to

<BR>the front also.'



<P>Ef&iacute;m kept looking out, so as not to lose sight of Elisha. But

when the Mass was over, the crowd began to sway, pushing forward to

<BR>kiss the tomb, and pushed Ef&iacute;m aside. He was again seized with

fear lest his purse should be stolen. Pressing it with his hand, he

<BR>began elbowing through the crowd, anxious only to get out. When he

reached the open, he went about for a long time searching

<BR>for Elisha both outside and in the Church itself. In the cells of the

Church he saw many people of all kinds, eating, and drinking

<BR>wine, and reading and sleeping there. But Elisha was nowhere to be

seen. So Ef&iacute;m returned to the inn without having found his

<BR>comrade. That evening the pilgrim in the skull-cap did not turn up.

He had gone off without repaying the rouble, and Ef&iacute;m was left

<BR>alone.



<P>The next day Ef&iacute;m went to the Holy Sepulchre again, with an old

man from Tamb&oacute;f, whom he had met on the ship. He tried to get

<BR>to the front, but was again pressed back; so he stood by a pillar and

prayed. He looked before him, and there in the foremost place

<BR>under the lamps, close to the very Sepulchre of the Lord, stood Elisha,

with his arms spread out like a priest at the altar, and with

<BR>his bald head all shining.



<P>'Well, now,' thought Ef&iacute;m, 'I won't lose him!'



<P>He pushed forward to the front, but when he got there, there was no

Elisha: he had evidently gone away.



<P>Again on the third day Ef&iacute;m looked, and saw at the Sepulchre,

in the holiest place, Elisha standing in the sight of all men, his arms

<BR>outspread, and his eyes gazing upwards as if he saw something above.

And his bald head was all shining.



<P>'Well, this time,' thought Ef&iacute;m, 'he shall not escape me! I will

go and stand at the door, then we can't miss one another!'



<P>Ef&iacute;m went out and stood by the door till past noon. Every one

had passed out, but still Elisha did not appear.



<P>Ef&iacute;m remained six weeks in Jerusalem, and went everywhere: to

Bethlehem, and to Bethany, and to the Jordan. He had a new

<BR>shirt sealed at the Holy Sepulchre for his burial, and he took a bottle

of water from the Jordan, and some holy earth, and bought

<BR>candles that had been lit at the sacred flame. In eight places he inscribed

names to be prayed for, and he spent all his money,

<BR>except just enough to get home with. Then he started homeward. He walked

to Jaffa, sailed thence to Odessa, and walked home

<BR>from there on foot.



<P>XI



<P>Ef&iacute;m travelled the same road he had come by; and as he drew nearer

home his former anxiety returned as to how affairs were

<BR>getting on in his absence. 'Much water flows away in a year,' the proverb

says. It takes a lifetime to build up a homestead, but not

<BR>long to ruin it, thought he. And he wondered how his son had managed

without him, what sort of spring they were having, how the

<BR>cattle had wintered, and whether the cottage was well finished. When

Ef&iacute;m came to the district where he had parted from Elisha

<BR>the summer before, he could hardly believe that the people living there

were the same. The year before they had been starving,

<BR>but now they were living in comfort. The harvest had been good, and

the people had recovered and had forgotten their former

<BR>misery.



<P>One evening Ef&iacute;m reached the very place where Elisha had remained

behind; and as he entered the village, a little girl in a white

<BR>smock ran out of a hut.



<P>Daddy, daddy, come to our house!'



<P>Ef&iacute;m meant to pass on, but the little girl would not let him.

She took hold of his coat, laughing, and pulled him towards the hut,

<BR>where a woman with a small boy came out into the porch and beckoned

to him.



<P>'Come in, grandfather,' she said. 'Have supper and spend the night with

us.'



<P>So Ef&iacute;m went in.



<P>'I may as well ask about Elisha,' he thought. 'I fancy this is the very

hut he went to for a drink of water.'



<P>The woman helped him off with the bag he carried, and gave him water

to wash his face. Then she made him sit down to table,

<BR>and set milk, curd-cakes and porridge before him. Ef&iacute;m thanked

her, and praised her for her kindness to a pilgrim. The woman

<BR>shook her head.



<P>'We have good reason to welcome pilgrims,' she said. 'It was a pilgrim

who showed us what life is. We were living forgetful of

<BR>God, and God punished us almost to death. We reached such a pass last

summer, that we all lay ill and helpless with nothing to

<BR>eat. And we should have died, but that God sent an old man to help

us -- just such a one as you. He came in one day to ask for a

<BR>drink of water, saw the state we were in, took pity on us, and remained

with us. He gave us food and drink, and set us on our feet

<BR>again; and he redeemed our land, and bought a cart and horse and gave

them to us.'



<P>Here the old woman entering the hut, interrupted the younger one and

said:



<P>'We don't know whether it was a man, or an angel from God. He loved

us all, pitied us all, and went away without telling us his

<BR>name, so that we don't even know whom to pray for. I can see it all

before me now! There I lay waiting for death, when in comes

<BR>a bald-headed old man. He was not anything much to look at, and he

asked for a drink of water. I, sinner that I am, thought to

<BR>myself: "What does he come prowling about here for?" And just think

what he did! As soon as he saw us, he let down his bag, on

<BR>this very spot, and untied it.'



<P>Here the little girl joined in.



<P>'No, Granny,' said she, 'first he put it down here in the middle of

the hut, and then he lifted it on to the bench.'



<P>And they began discussing and recalling all he had said and done, where

he sat and slept, and what he had said to each of them.



<P>At night the peasant himself came home on his horse, and he too began

to tell about Elisha and how he had lived with them.



<P>'Had he not come we should all have died in our sins. We were dying

in despair, murmuring against God and man. But he set us

<BR>on our feet again; and through him we learned to know God, and to believe

that there is good in man. May the Lord bless him! We

<BR>used to live like animals; he made human beings of us.



<P>After giving Ef&iacute;m food and drink, they showed him where he was

to sleep; and lay down to sleep themselves.



<P>But though Ef&iacute;m lay down, he could not sleep. He could not get

Elisha out of his mind, but remembered how he had seen him three

<BR>times at Jerusalem, standing in the foremost place.



<P>'So that is how he got ahead of me,' thought Ef&iacute;m. 'God may or

may not have accepted my pilgrimage but He has certainly

<BR>accepted his!'



<P>Next morning Ef&iacute;m bade farewell to the people, who put some patties

in his sack before they went to their work, and he continued

<BR>his journey.



<P>XII



<P>Ef&iacute;m had been away just a year, and it was spring again when

he reached home one evening. His son was not at home, but had

<BR>gone to the public-house and when he came back, he had had a drop too

much. Ef&iacute;m began questioning him. Everything showed

<BR>that the young fellow had been unsteady during his father's absence.

The money had all been wrongly spent, and the work had

<BR>been neglected. The father began to upbraid the son; and the son answered

rudely.



<P>'Why didn't you stay and look after it yourself?' he said. 'You go off,

taking the money with you and now you demand it of me!'



<P>The old man grew angry, and struck his son.



<P>In the morning Ef&iacute;m went to the village Elder to complain of

his son's conduct. As he was passing Elisha's house, his friend's wife

<BR>greeted him from the porch.



<P>'How do you do, neighbour,' she said. 'How do you do, dear friend? Did

you get to Jerusalem safely?'



<P>Ef&iacute;m stopped.



<P>'Yes, thank God,' he said. 'I have been there. I lost sight of your

old man, but I hear he got home safely.'



<P>The old woman was fond of talking:



<P>'Yes, neighbour, he has come back,' said she. 'He's been back a long

time. Soon after Assumption, I think it was, he returned. And

<BR>we were glad the Lord had sent him back to us! We were dull without

him. We can't expect much work from him any more, his

<BR>years for work are past; but still he is the head of the household

and it's more cheerful when he's at home. And how glad our lad

<BR>was! He said, "It's like being without sunlight, when father's away!"

It was dull without him, dear friend. We're fond of him, and

<BR>take good care of him.'



<P>'Is he at home now?'



<P>'He is, dear friend. He is with his bees. He is hiving the swarms. He

says they are swarming well this year. The Lord has given

<BR>such strength to the bees that my husband doesn't remember the like.

"The Lord is not rewarding us according to our sins," he

<BR>says. Come in, dear neighbour, he will be so glad to see you again.'



<P>Ef&iacute;m passed through the passage into the yard and to the apiary,

to see Elisha. There was Elisha in his grey coat, without any

<BR>face-net or gloves, standing, under the birch trees, looking upwards,

his arms stretched out and his bald head shining, as Ef&iacute;m had

<BR>seen him at the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem: and above him the sunlight

shone through the birches as the flames of fire had done

<BR>in the holy place, and the golden bees flew round his head like a halo,

and did not sting him.



<P>Ef&iacute;m stopped. The old woman called to her husband.



<P>'Here's your friend come,' she cried.



<P>Elisha looked round with a pleased face, and came towards Ef&iacute;m,

gently picking bees out of his own beard.



<P>'Good day, neighbour, good-day, dear friend. Did you get there safely?'



<P>'My feet walked there, and I have brought you some water from the river

Jordan. You must come to my house for it. But whether

<BR>the Lord accepted my efforts. . . .'



<P>'Well the Lord be thanked! May Christ bless you!' said Elisha.



<P>Ef&iacute;m was silent for a while, and then added:



<P>'My feet have been there, but whether my soul, or another's, has been

there more truly . . .'



<P>'That's God's business, neighbour, God's business,' interrupted Elisha.



<P>'On my return journey I stopped at the hut where you remained behind.

. . .'



<P>Elisha was alarmed, and said hurriedly:



<P>'God's business, neighbour, God's business! Come into the cottage, I'll

give you some of our honey.' And Elisha changed the

<BR>conversation, and talked of home affairs.



<P>Ef&iacute;m sighed, and did not speak to Elisha of the people in the

hut, nor of how he had seen him in Jerusalem. But he now understood

<BR>that the best way to keep one's vows to God and to do His will, is

for each man while he lives to show love and do good to others.
