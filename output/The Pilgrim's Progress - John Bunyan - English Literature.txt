<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Now, Reader, I have told my dream to thee;



<P>See if thou canst interpret it to me,



<P>Or to thyself, or neighbour; but take heed



<P>Of misinterpreting; for that, instead



<P>Of doing good, will but thyself abuse:



<P>By misinterpreting, evil ensues.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Take heed, also, that thou be not extreme,



<P>In playing with the outside of my dream:



<P>Nor let my figure or similitude



<P>Put thee into a laughter or a feud.



<P>Leave this for boys and fools; but as for thee,



<P>Do thou the substance of my matter see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Put by the curtains, look within my veil,



<P>Turn up my metaphors, and do not fail,



<P>There, if thou seekest them, such things to find,



<P>As will be helpful to an honest mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>What of my dross thou findest there, be bold



<P>To throw away, but yet preserve the gold;



<P>What if my gold be wrapped up in ore?--



<P>None throws away the apple for the core.



<P>But if thou shalt cast all away as vain,



<P>I know not but 'twill make me dream again.

<P>SAVE-ALL.&nbsp; That is bad, but we read of some that are righteous

overmuch;



<P>and such men's rigidness prevails with them to judge and condemn



<P>all but themselves.&nbsp; But, I pray, what, and how many,



<P>were the things wherein you differed?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; Why, they, after their headstrong manner,



<P>conclude that it is duty to rush on their journey all weathers;



<P>and I am for waiting for wind and tide.&nbsp; They are for hazarding

all



<P>for God at a clap; and I am for taking all advantages to secure



<P>my life and estate.&nbsp; They are for holding their notions,



<P>though all other men are against them; but I am for religion in what,



<P>and so far as the times, and my safety, will bear it.&nbsp; They are

for



<P>religion when in rags and contempt; but I am for him when he walks



<P>in his golden slippers, in the sunshine, and with applause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{252}



<P>HOLD-THE-WORLD.&nbsp; Ay, and hold you there still, good Mr. By-ends;



<P>for, for my part, I can count him but a fool, that, having the liberty



<P>to keep what he has, shall be so unwise as to lose it.



<P>Let us be wise as serpents; it is best to make hay when the sun shines;



<P>you see how the bee lieth still all winter, and bestirs her only



<P>when she can have profit with pleasure.&nbsp; God sends sometimes rain,



<P>and sometimes sunshine; if they be such fools to go through the first,



<P>yet let us be content to take fair weather along with us.&nbsp; For

my part,



<P>I like that religion best that will stand with the security



<P>of God's good blessings unto us; for who can imagine,



<P>that is ruled by his reason, since God has bestowed upon us



<P>the good things of this life, but that he would have us keep them



<P>for his sake?&nbsp; Abraham and Solomon grew rich in religion.



<P>And Job says, that a good man shall lay up gold as dust.



<P>But he must not be such as the men before us, if they be



<P>as you have described them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>SAVE-ALL.&nbsp; I think that we are all agreed in this matter,



<P>and therefore there needs no more words about it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MONEY-LOVE.&nbsp; No, there needs no more words about this matter,



<P>indeed; for he that believes neither Scripture nor reason



<P>(and you see we have both on our side) neither knows his own liberty,



<P>nor seeks his own safety.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{253}



<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; My brethren, we are, as you see, going all on pilgrimage;



<P>and, for our better diversion from things that are bad,



<P>give me leave to propound unto you this question:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Suppose a man, a minister, or a tradesman, &amp;c., should have



<P>an advantage lie before him, to get the good blessings of this life,



<P>yet so as that he can by no means come by them except,



<P>in appearance at least, he becomes extraordinarily zealous



<P>in some points of religion that he meddled not with before,



<P>may he not use these means to attain his end, and yet be



<P>a right honest man?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{254}



<P>MONEY-LOVE.&nbsp; I see the bottom of your question; and,



<P>with these gentlemen's good leave, I will endeavour to shape you



<P>an answer.&nbsp; And first, to speak to your question as it concerns



<P>a minister himself:&nbsp; Suppose a minister, a worthy man,



<P>possessed but of a very small benefice, and has in his eye a greater,



<P>more fat, and plump by far; he has also now an opportunity



<P>of getting of it, yet so as by being more studious, by preaching



<P>more frequently and zealously, and, because the temper of the people



<P>requires it, by altering of some of his principles; for my part,



<P>I see no reason but a man may do this, (provided he has a call), ay,



<P>and more a great deal besides, and yet be an honest man.&nbsp; For why--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{255}



<P>1.&nbsp; His desire of a greater benefice is lawful, (this cannot



<P>be contradicted), since it is set before him by Providence; so then,



<P>he may get it, if he can, making no question for conscience' sake.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{256}



<P>2.&nbsp; Besides, his desire after that benefice makes him more studious,



<P>a more zealous preacher, &amp;c., and so makes him a better man;



<P>yea, makes him better improve his parts, which is according to



<P>the mind of God.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{257}



<P>3.&nbsp; Now, as for his complying with the temper of his people,



<P>by dissenting, to serve them, some of his principles,



<P>this argueth, (1) That he is of a self-denying, temper;



<P>(2) Of a sweet and winning deportment; and so (3) more fit



<P>for the ministerial function.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{258}



<P>4.&nbsp; I conclude, then, that a minister that changes a small for

a great,



<P>should not, for so doing, be judged as covetous; but rather,



<P>since he has improved in his parts and industry thereby,



<P>be counted as one that pursues his call, and the opportunity



<P>put into his hands to do good.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{259}



<P>And now to the second part of the question, which concerns



<P>the tradesman you mentioned.&nbsp; Suppose such a one to have



<P>but a poor employ in the world, but by becoming religious,



<P>he may mend his market, perhaps get a rich wife, or more and far better



<P>customers to his shop; for my part, I see no reason but that this



<P>may be lawfully done.&nbsp; For why--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1.&nbsp; To become religious is a virtue, by what means soever



<P>a man becomes so.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2.&nbsp; Nor is it unlawful to get a rich wife, or more custom to my

shop.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3.&nbsp; Besides, the man that gets these by becoming religious, gets

that



<P>which is good, of them that are good, by becoming good himself;



<P>so then here is a good wife, and good customers, and good gain,



<P>and all these by becoming religious, which is good; therefore,



<P>to become religious, to get all these, is a good and profitable design.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{260}



<P>This answer, thus made by this Mr. Money-love to Mr. By-ends's question,



<P>was highly applauded by them all; wherefore they concluded



<P>upon the whole, that it was most wholesome and advantageous.



<P>And because, as they thought, no man was able to contradict it,



<P>and because Christian and Hopeful were yet within call,



<P>they jointly agreed to assault them with the question as soon



<P>as they overtook them; and the rather because they had opposed



<P>Mr. By-ends before.&nbsp; So they called after them, and they stopped,



<P>and stood still till they came up to them; but they concluded,



<P>as they went, that not Mr. By-ends, but old Mr. Hold-the-world,



<P>should propound the question to them, because, as they supposed,



<P>their answer to him would be without the remainder of that heat



<P>that was kindled betwixt Mr. By-ends and them, at their parting



<P>a little before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{260}



<P>So they came up to each other, and after a short salutation,



<P>Mr. Hold-the-world propounded the question to Christian and his fellow,



<P>and bid them to answer it if they could.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian, Even a babe in religion may answer



<P>ten thousand such questions.&nbsp; For if it be unlawful to follow Christ



<P>for loaves, (as it is in the sixth of John), how much more



<P>abominable is it to make of him and religion a stalking-horse



<P>to get and enjoy the world!&nbsp; Nor do we find any other than heathens,



<P>hypocrites, devils, and witches, that are of this opinion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{261}



<P>1.&nbsp; Heathens; for when Hamor and Shechem had a mind to the daughter



<P>and cattle of Jacob, and saw that there was no way for them



<P>to come at them, but by becoming circumcised, they say



<P>to their companions, If every male of us be circumcised,



<P>as they are circumcised, shall not their cattle, and their substance,



<P>and every beast of theirs, be ours?&nbsp; Their daughter and their cattle



<P>were that which they sought to obtain, and their religion



<P>the stalking-horse they made use of to come at them.



<P>Read the whole story.&nbsp; [Gen. 34:20-23]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{262}



<P>2.&nbsp; The hypocritical Pharisees were also of this religion;



<P>long prayers were their pretence, but to get widows' houses



<P>was their intent; and greater damnation was from God their judgment.



<P>[Luke 20:46-47]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{263}



<P>3.&nbsp; Judas the devil was also of this religion; he was religious



<P>for the bag, that he might be possessed of what was therein;



<P>but he was lost, cast away, and the very son of perdition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{264}



<P>4.&nbsp; Simon the witch was of this religion too; for he would have

had



<P>the Holy Ghost, that he might have got money therewith;



<P>and his sentence from Peter's mouth was according.&nbsp; [Acts 8:19-22]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{265}



<P>5.&nbsp; Neither will it out of my mind, but that that man that



<P>takes up religion for the world, will throw away religion for the world;



<P>for so surely as Judas resigned the world in becoming religious,



<P>so surely did he also sell religion and his Master for the same.



<P>To answer the question, therefore, affirmatively, as I perceive



<P>you have done, and to accept of, as authentic, such answer,



<P>is both heathenish, hypocritical, and devilish; and your reward will

be



<P>according to your works.&nbsp; Then they stood staring one upon another,



<P>but had not wherewith to answer Christian.&nbsp; Hopeful also approved

of



<P>the soundness of Christian's answer; so there was a great silence



<P>among them.&nbsp; Mr. By-ends and his company also staggered and kept

behind,



<P>that Christian and Hopeful might outgo them.&nbsp; Then said Christian



<P>to his fellow, If these men cannot stand before the sentence of men,



<P>what will they do with the sentence of God?&nbsp; And if they are mute



<P>when dealt with by vessels of clay, what will they do when they shall

be



<P>rebuked by the flames of a devouring fire?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{266}



<P>&lt;The ease that pilgrims have is but little in this life>



<P>Then Christian and Hopeful outwent them again, and went till they came



<P>to a delicate plain called Ease, where they went with much content;



<P>but that plain was but narrow, so they were quickly got over it.



<P>&lt;Lucre Hill a dangerous hill>&nbsp; Now at the further side of that

plain



<P>was a little hill called Lucre, and in that hill a silver mine,



<P>which some of them that had formerly gone that way,



<P>because of the rarity of it, had turned aside to see; but going too

near



<P>the brink of the pit, the ground being deceitful under them, broke,



<P>and they were slain; some also had been maimed there, and could not,



<P>to their dying day, be their own men again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{267}



<P>&lt;Demas at the Hill Lucre.&nbsp; He calls to Christian and Hopeful



<P>to come to him>



<P>Then I saw in my dream, that a little off the road,



<P>over against the silver mine, stood Demas (gentlemanlike)



<P>to call to passengers to come and see; who said to Christian



<P>and his fellow, Ho! turn aside hither, and I will show you a thing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; What thing so deserving as to turn us out of the way to see

it?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>DEMAS.&nbsp; Here is a silver mine, and some digging in it for treasure.



<P>If you will come, with a little pains you may richly provide



<P>for yourselves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{268}



<P>&lt;Hopeful tempted to go, but Christian holds him back>



<P>Hope. Then said Hopeful, Let us go see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Not I, said Christian, I have heard of this place before

now;



<P>and how many have there been slain; and besides that,



<P>treasure is a snare to those that seek it; for it hindereth them



<P>in their pilgrimage.&nbsp; Then Christian called to Demas, saying,



<P>Is not the place dangerous?&nbsp; Hath it not hindered many



<P>in their pilgrimage?&nbsp; [Hos. 14:8]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>DEMAS.&nbsp; Not very dangerous, except to those that are careless,



<P>(but withal, he blushed as he spake).

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian to Hopeful, Let us not stir a step,



<P>but still keep on our way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I will warrant you, when By-ends comes up, if he hath



<P>the same invitation as we, he will turn in thither to see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; No doubt thereof, for his principles lead him that way,



<P>and a hundred to one but he dies there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>DEMAS.&nbsp; Then Demas called again, saying, But will you not



<P>come over and see?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{269}



<P>&lt;Christian roundeth up Demas>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then Christian roundly answered, saying, Demas,



<P>thou art an enemy to the right ways of the Lord of this way,



<P>and hast been already condemned for thine own turning aside,



<P>by one of His Majesty's judges [2 Tim. 4:10]; and why seekest thou



<P>to bring us into the like condemnation?&nbsp; Besides, if we at all



<P>turn aside, our Lord and King will certainly hear thereof,



<P>and will there put us to shame, where we would stand with boldness



<P>before him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Demas cried again, that he also was one of their fraternity;



<P>and that if they would tarry a little, he also himself



<P>would walk with them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{270}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian, What is thy name?&nbsp; Is it not the

same



<P>by the which I have called thee?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>DEMAS.&nbsp; Yes, my name is Demas; I am the son of Abraham.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I know you; Gehazi was your great-grandfather,



<P>and Judas your father; and you have trod in their steps.



<P>[2 Kings 5:20, Matt. 26:14,15, 27:1-5]&nbsp; It is but a devilish prank



<P>that thou usest; thy father was hanged for a traitor,



<P>and thou deservest no better reward.&nbsp; Assure thyself,



<P>that when we come to the King, we will do him word of this



<P>thy behaviour.&nbsp; Thus they went their way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{271}



<P>&lt;By-ends goes over to Demas>



<P>By this time By-ends and his companions were come again within sight,



<P>and they, at the first beck, went over to Demas.&nbsp; Now,



<P>whether they fell into the pit by looking over the brink thereof,



<P>or whether they went down to dig, or whether they were smothered



<P>in the bottom by the damps that commonly arise, of these things



<P>I am not certain; but this I observed, that they never were seen again



<P>in the way.&nbsp; Then sang Christian--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By-ends and silver Demas both agree;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One calls, the other runs, that he may be



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sharer in his lucre; so these do



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take up in this world, and no further go.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{272}



<P>&lt;They see a strange monument>



<P>Now I saw that, just on the other side of this plain,



<P>the pilgrims came to a place where stood an old monument,



<P>hard by the highway side, at the sight of which they were



<P>both concerned, because of the strangeness of the form thereof;



<P>for it seemed to them as if it had been a woman transformed



<P>into the shape of a pillar; here, therefore they stood looking,



<P>and looking upon it, but could not for a time tell what



<P>they should make thereof.&nbsp; At last Hopeful espied written above



<P>the head thereof, a writing in an unusual hand; but he being no scholar,



<P>called to Christian (for he was learned) to see if he could pick out



<P>the meaning; so he came, and after a little laying of letters together,



<P>he found the same to be this, "Remember Lot's Wife".&nbsp; So he read

it



<P>to his fellow; after which they both concluded that that was



<P>the pillar of salt into which Lot's wife was turned,



<P>for her looking back with a covetous heart, when she was going



<P>from Sodom for safety.&nbsp; [Gen. 19:26]&nbsp;&nbsp; Which sudden and

amazing sight



<P>gave them occasion of this discourse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{273}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Ah, my brother! this is a seasonable sight;



<P>it came opportunely to us after the invitation which Demas gave us



<P>to come over to view the Hill Lucre; and had we gone over,



<P>as he desired us, and as thou wast inclining to do, my brother,



<P>we had, for aught I know, been made ourselves like this woman,



<P>a spectacle for those that shall come after to behold.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I am sorry that I was so foolish, and am made to wonder



<P>that I am not now as Lot's wife; for wherein was the difference betwixt



<P>her sin and mine?&nbsp; She only looked back; and I had a desire to

go see.



<P>Let grace be adored, and let me be ashamed that ever such a thing



<P>should be in mine heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{274}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Let us take notice of what we see here, for our help



<P>for time to come.&nbsp; This woman escaped one judgment,



<P>for she fell not by the destruction of Sodom; yet she was destroyed



<P>by another, as we see she is turned into a pillar of salt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; True; and she may be to us both caution and example;



<P>caution, that we should shun her sin; or a sign of what judgment



<P>will overtake such as shall not be prevented by this caution;



<P>so Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with the two hundred and fifty men



<P>that perished in their sin, did also become a sign or example to others



<P>to beware.&nbsp; [Num. 26:9,10]&nbsp; But above all, I muse at one thing,

to wit,



<P>how Demas and his fellows can stand so confidently yonder to look for



<P>that treasure, which this woman, but for looking behind her after,



<P>(for we read not that she stepped one foot out of the way) was turned



<P>into a pillar of salt; especially since the judgment which overtook

her



<P>did make her an example, within sight of where they are;



<P>for they cannot choose but see her, did they but lift up their eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{275}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; It is a thing to be wondered at, and it argueth that



<P>their hearts are grown desperate in the case; and I cannot tell who



<P>to compare them to so fitly, as to them that pick pockets



<P>in the presence of the judge, or that will cut purses under the gallows.



<P>It is said of the men of Sodom, that they were sinners exceedingly,



<P>because they were sinners before the Lord, that is, in his eyesight,



<P>and notwithstanding the kindnesses that he had showed them [Gen. 13:13];



<P>for the land of Sodom was now like the garden of Eden heretofore.



<P>[Gen. 13:10]&nbsp; This, therefore, provoked him the more to jealousy,



<P>and made their plague as hot as the fire of the Lord out of heaven



<P>could make it.&nbsp; And it is most rationally to be concluded, that

such,



<P>even such as these are, that shall sin in the sight, yea,



<P>and that too in despite of such examples that are set continually



<P>before them, to caution them to the contrary, must be partakers



<P>of severest judgments.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Doubtless thou hast said the truth; but what a mercy is

it,



<P>that neither thou, but especially I, am not made myself this example!



<P>This ministereth occasion to us to thank God, to fear before him,



<P>and always to remember Lot's wife.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{276}



<P>&lt;A river>



<P>I saw, then, that they went on their way to a pleasant river;



<P>which David the king called "the river of God", but John,



<P>"the river of the water of life".&nbsp; [Ps. 65:9, Rev. 22, Ezek. 47]



<P>Now their way lay just upon the bank of the river; here, therefore,



<P>Christian and his companion walked with great delight;



<P>they drank also of the water of the river, which was pleasant,



<P>and enlivening to their weary spirits:&nbsp; &lt;Trees by the river.



<P>The fruit and leaves of the tree> besides, on the banks of this river,



<P>on either side, were green trees, that bore all manner of fruit;



<P>and the leaves of the trees were good for medicine;



<P>with the fruit of these trees they were also much delighted;



<P>and the leaves they eat to prevent surfeits, and other diseases



<P>that are incident to those that heat their blood by travels.



<P>&lt;A meadow in which they lie down to sleep>&nbsp; On either side of

the river



<P>was also a meadow, curiously beautified with lilies, and it was green



<P>all the year long.&nbsp; In this meadow they lay down, and slept;



<P>for here they might lie down safely.&nbsp; When they awoke,



<P>they gathered again of the fruit of the trees, and drank again



<P>of the water of the river, and then lay down again to sleep.



<P>[Ps. 23:2, Isa. 14:30]&nbsp; Thus they did several days and nights.



<P>Then they sang--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold ye how these crystal streams do

glide,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To comfort pilgrims by the highway side;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meadows green, beside their fragrant

smell,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yield dainties for them; and he that

can tell



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What pleasant fruit, yea, leaves, these

trees do yield,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will soon sell all, that he may buy this

field.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So when they were disposed to go on, (for they were not, as yet,



<P>at their journey's end,) they ate and drank, and departed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{277}



<P>&lt;By-path Meadow>



<P>Now, I beheld in my dream, that they had not journeyed far,



<P>but the river and the way for a time parted; at which they were not



<P>a little sorry; yet they durst not go out of the way.



<P>Now the way from the river was rough, and their feet tender,



<P>by reason of their travels; so the souls of the pilgrims



<P>were much discouraged because of the way.&nbsp; [Num. 21:4]&nbsp; Wherefore,



<P>still as they went on, they wished for better way.&nbsp; Now,



<P>a little before them, there was on the left hand of the road a meadow,



<P>and a stile to go over into it; and that meadow is called



<P>By-path Meadow.&nbsp; &lt;One temptation does make way for another>&nbsp;

Then said



<P>Christian to his fellow, If this meadow lieth along by our wayside,



<P>let us go over into it.&nbsp; Then he went to the stile to see, and

behold,



<P>a path lay along by the way, on the other side of the fence.



<P>It is according to my wish, said Christian.&nbsp; Here is the easiest

going;



<P>come, good Hopeful, and let us go over.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{278}



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But how if this path should lead us out of the way?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Strong Christians may lead weak ones out of the way>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; That is not like, said the other.&nbsp; Look, doth it not

go along



<P>by the wayside?&nbsp; So Hopeful, being persuaded by his fellow,



<P>went after him over the stile.&nbsp; &lt;See what it is too suddenly



<P>to fall in with strangers>&nbsp; When they were gone over,



<P>and were got into the path, they found it very easy for their feet;



<P>and withal, they, looking before them, espied a man walking as they

did,



<P>(and his name was Vain-confidence); so they called after him,



<P>and asked him whither that way led.&nbsp; He said, To the Celestial

Gate.



<P>Look, said Christian, did not I tell you so?&nbsp; By this you may see



<P>we are right.&nbsp; So they followed, and he went before them.



<P>But, behold, the night came on, and it grew very dark;



<P>so that they that were behind lost the sight of him that went before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{279}



<P>&lt;A pit to catch the vain-glorious in>



<P>He, therefore, that went before, (Vain-confidence by name),



<P>not seeing the way before him, fell into a deep pit [Isa. 9:16],



<P>which was on purpose there made, by the Prince of those grounds,



<P>to catch vain-glorious fools withal, and was dashed in pieces



<P>with his fall.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{280}



<P>&lt;Reasoning between Christian and Hopeful>



<P>Now Christian and his fellow heard him fall.&nbsp; So they called to

know



<P>the matter, but there was none to answer, only they heard a groaning.



<P>Then said Hopeful, Where are we now?&nbsp; Then was his fellow silent,



<P>as mistrusting that he had led him out of the way; and now it began



<P>to rain, and thunder, and lighten in a very dreadful manner;



<P>and the water rose amain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then Hopeful groaned in himself, saying, Oh, that I had kept on my way!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{281}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Who could have thought that this path should have led us



<P>out of the way?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I was afraid on it at the very first, and therefore gave

you



<P>that gentle caution.&nbsp; I would have spoken plainer, but that you



<P>are older than I.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Christian's repentance for leading of his brother out of the way>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Good brother, be not offended; I am sorry I have brought

thee



<P>out of the way, and that I have put thee into such imminent danger;



<P>pray, my brother, forgive me; I did not do it of an evil intent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Be comforted, my brother, for I forgive thee; and believe,

too,



<P>that this shall be for our good.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I am glad I have with me a merciful brother; but we must

not



<P>stand thus: let us try to go back again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But, good brother, let me go before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; No, if you please, let me go first, that if there be any

danger,



<P>I may be first therein, because by my means we are both gone out



<P>of the way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{282}



<P>&lt;They are in danger of drowning as they go back>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; No, said Hopeful, you shall not go first; for your mind



<P>being troubled may lead you out of the way again.&nbsp; Then,



<P>for their encouragement, they heard the voice of one saying,



<P>"Set thine heart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest;



<P>turn again."&nbsp; [Jer. 31:21]&nbsp; But by this time the waters



<P>were greatly risen, by reason of which the way of going back



<P>was very dangerous.&nbsp; (Then I thought that it is easier going out



<P>of the way, when we are in, than going in when we are out.)



<P>Yet they adventured to go back, but it was so dark,



<P>and the flood was so high, that in their going back they had like



<P>to have been drowned nine or ten times.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{283}



<P>&lt;They sleep in the grounds of Giant Despair>



<P>Neither could they, with all the skill they had, get again to the stile



<P>that night.&nbsp; Wherefore, at last, lighting under a little shelter,



<P>they sat down there until the daybreak; but, being weary,



<P>they fell asleep.&nbsp; &lt;He finds them in his grounds, and carries

them



<P>to Doubting Castle>&nbsp; Now there was, not far from the place



<P>where they lay, a castle called Doubting Castle, the owner whereof



<P>was Giant Despair; and it was in his grounds they now were sleeping:



<P>wherefore he, getting up in the morning early, and walking up and down



<P>in his fields, caught Christian and Hopeful asleep in his grounds.



<P>Then, with a grim and surly voice, he bid them awake; and asked them



<P>whence they were, and what they did in his grounds.&nbsp; They told

him



<P>they were pilgrims, and that they had lost their way.



<P>Then said the Giant, You have this night trespassed on me,



<P>by trampling in and lying on my grounds, and therefore you must go along



<P>with me.&nbsp; So they were forced to go, because he was stronger than

they.



<P>They also had but little to say, for they knew themselves in a fault.



<P>&lt;The grievousness of their imprisonment>&nbsp; The Giant, therefore,



<P>drove them before him, and put them into his castle,



<P>into a very dark dungeon, nasty and stinking to the spirits of these



<P>two men.&nbsp; [Ps. 88:18]&nbsp; Here, then, they lay from Wednesday

morning



<P>till Saturday night, without one bit of bread, or drop of drink,



<P>or light, or any to ask how they did; they were, therefore,



<P>here in evil case, and were far from friends and acquaintance.



<P>Now in this place Christian had double sorrow, because it was through



<P>his unadvised counsel that they were brought into this distress.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pilgrims now, to gratify the flesh,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will seek its ease; but oh! how they afresh



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do thereby plunge themselves new griefs into!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who seek to please the flesh, themselves undo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{284}



<P>&lt;On Thursday, Giant Despair beats his prisoners>



<P>Now, Giant Despair had a wife, and her name was Diffidence.



<P>So when he was gone to bed, he told his wife what he had done; to wit,



<P>that he had taken a couple of prisoners and cast them into his dungeon,



<P>for trespassing on his grounds.&nbsp; Then he asked her also what he



<P>had best to do further to them.&nbsp; So she asked him what they were,



<P>whence they came, and whither they were bound; and he told her.



<P>Then she counselled him that when he arose in the morning



<P>he should beat them without any mercy.&nbsp; So, when he arose,



<P>he getteth him a grievous crab-tree cudgel, and goes down into



<P>the dungeon to them, and there first falls to rating of them



<P>as if they were dogs, although they never gave him a word of distaste.



<P>Then he falls upon them, and beats them fearfully, in such sort that



<P>they were not able to help themselves, or to turn them upon the floor.



<P>This done, he withdraws and leaves them there to condole their misery



<P>and to mourn under their distress.&nbsp; So all that day they spent

the time



<P>in nothing but sighs and bitter lamentations.&nbsp; The next night,

she,



<P>talking with her husband about them further, and understanding they

were



<P>yet alive, did advise him to counsel them to make away themselves.



<P>&lt;On Friday, Giant Despair counsels them to kill themselves>



<P>So when morning was come, he goes to them in a surly manner as before,



<P>and perceiving them to be very sore with the stripes that he had



<P>given them the day before, he told them, that since they were



<P>never like to come out of that place, their only way would be forthwith



<P>to make an end of themselves, either with knife, halter, or poison,



<P>for why, said he, should you choose life, seeing it is attended



<P>with so much bitterness?&nbsp; But they desired him to let them go.



<P>&lt;The giant sometimes has fits>&nbsp; With that he looked ugly upon

them,



<P>and, rushing to them, had doubtless made an end of them himself,



<P>but that he fell into one of his fits, (for he sometimes,



<P>in sunshiny weather, fell into fits), and lost for a time the use



<P>of his hand; wherefore he withdrew, and left them as before, to consider



<P>what to do.&nbsp; Then did the prisoners consult between themselves



<P>whether it was best to take his counsel or no; and thus they began



<P>to discourse:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{285}



<P>&lt;Christian crushed>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Brother, said Christian, what shall we do?&nbsp; The life

that



<P>we now live is miserable.&nbsp; For my part I know not whether is best,



<P>to live thus, or to die out of hand.&nbsp; "My soul chooseth strangling



<P>rather than life", and the grave is more easy for me than this dungeon.



<P>[Job 7:15]&nbsp; Shall we be ruled by the Giant?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{286}



<P>&lt;Hopeful comforts him>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Indeed, our present condition is dreadful, and death would

be



<P>far more welcome to me than thus for ever to abide; but yet,



<P>let us consider, the Lord of the country to which we are going



<P>hath said, Thou shalt do no murder:&nbsp; no, not to another man's person;



<P>much more, then, are we forbidden to take his counsel to kill ourselves.



<P>Besides, he that kills another, can but commit murder upon his body;



<P>but for one to kill himself is to kill body and soul at once.



<P>And, moreover, my brother, thou talkest of ease in the grave;



<P>but hast thou forgotten the hell, for certain the murderers go?



<P>"For no murderer hath eternal life," &amp;c.&nbsp; And let us consider,

again,



<P>that all the law is not in the hand of Giant Despair.&nbsp; Others,



<P>so far as I can understand, have been taken by him, as well as we;



<P>and yet have escaped out of his hand.&nbsp; Who knows, but the God



<P>that made the world may cause that Giant Despair may die? or that,



<P>at some time or other, he may forget to lock us in? or that he may,



<P>in a short time, have another of his fits before us, and may lose



<P>the use of his limbs? and if ever that should come to pass again,



<P>for my part, I am resolved to pluck up the heart of a man,



<P>and to try my utmost to get from under his hand.&nbsp; I was a fool



<P>that I did not try to do it before; but, however, my brother,



<P>let us be patient, and endure a while.&nbsp; The time may come



<P>that may give us a happy release; but let us not be our own murderers.



<P>With these words Hopeful at present did moderate the mind



<P>of his brother; so they continued together (in the dark) that day,



<P>in their sad and doleful condition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{287}



<P>Well, towards evening, the Giant goes down into the dungeon again,



<P>to see if his prisoners had taken his counsel; but when he came there



<P>he found them alive; and truly, alive was all; for now,



<P>what for want of bread and water, and by reason of the wounds



<P>they received when he beat them, they could do little but breathe.



<P>But, I say, he found them alive; at which he fell into a grievous rage,



<P>and told them that, seeing they had disobeyed his counsel,



<P>it should be worse with them than if they had never been born.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{288}



<P>&lt;Christian still dejected>



<P>At this they trembled greatly, and I think that Christian



<P>fell into a swoon; but, coming a little to himself again,



<P>they renewed their discourse about the Giant's counsel; and whether

yet



<P>they had best to take it or no.&nbsp; Now Christian again seemed to

be



<P>for doing it, but Hopeful made his second reply as followeth:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{289}



<P>&lt;Hopeful comforts him again, by calling former things to remembrance>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; My brother, said he, rememberest thou not how valiant



<P>thou hast been heretofore?&nbsp; Apollyon could not crush thee,



<P>nor could all that thou didst hear, or see, or feel,



<P>in the Valley of the Shadow of Death.&nbsp; What hardship, terror,



<P>and amazement hast thou already gone through!&nbsp; And art thou now



<P>nothing but fear!&nbsp; Thou seest that I am in the dungeon with thee,



<P>a far weaker man by nature than thou art; also, this Giant has wounded



<P>me as well as thee, and hath also cut off the bread and water



<P>from my mouth; and with thee I mourn without the light.



<P>But let us exercise a little more patience; remember how thou



<P>playedst the man at Vanity Fair, and wast neither afraid of the chain,



<P>nor cage, nor yet of bloody death.&nbsp; Wherefore let us (at least



<P>to avoid the shame, that becomes not a Christian to be found in)



<P>bear up with patience as well as we can.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{290}



<P>Now, night being come again, and the Giant and his wife being in bed,



<P>she asked him concerning the prisoners, and if they had taken



<P>his counsel.&nbsp; To which he replied, They are sturdy rogues,



<P>they choose rather to bear all hardship, than to make away themselves.



<P>Then said she, Take them into the castle-yard to-morrow, and show them



<P>the bones and skulls of those that thou hast already despatched,



<P>and make them believe, ere a week comes to an end, thou also wilt



<P>tear them in pieces, as thou hast done their fellows before them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{291}



<P>&lt;On Saturday, the Giant threatened that shortly he would



<P>pull them in pieces>



<P>So when the morning was come, the Giant goes to them again,



<P>and takes them into the castle-yard, and shows them, as his wife



<P>had bidden him.&nbsp; These, said he, were pilgrims as you are, once,



<P>and they trespassed in my grounds, as you have done;



<P>and when I thought fit, I tore them in pieces, and so, within ten days,



<P>I will do you. Go, get you down to your den again; and with that



<P>he beat them all the way thither.&nbsp; They lay, therefore,



<P>all day on Saturday in a lamentable case, as before.&nbsp; Now,



<P>when night was come, and when Mrs. Diffidence and her husband,



<P>the Giant, were got to bed, they began to renew their discourse



<P>of their prisoners; and withal the old Giant wondered,



<P>that he could neither by his blows nor his counsel bring them to an

end.



<P>And with that his wife replied, I fear, said she, that they live in

hope



<P>that some will come to relieve them, or that they have picklocks



<P>about them, by the means of which they hope to escape.



<P>And sayest thou so, my dear? said the Giant; I will, therefore,



<P>search them in the morning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{292}



<P>Well, on Saturday, about midnight, they began to pray,



<P>and continued in prayer till almost break of day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;A key in Christian's bosom, called Promise, opens any lock



<P>in Doubting Castle>



<P>Now, a little before it was day, good Christian, as one half amazed,



<P>brake out in this passionate speech:--&nbsp; What a fool, quoth he,

am I,



<P>thus to lie in a stinking dungeon, when I may as well walk at liberty!



<P>I have a key in my bosom, called Promise, that will, I am persuaded,



<P>open any lock in Doubting Castle.&nbsp; Then said Hopeful,



<P>That is good news, good brother; pluck it out of thy bosom, and try.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{293}



<P>Then Christian pulled it out of his bosom, and began to try



<P>at the dungeon door, whose bolt (as he turned the key) gave back,



<P>and the door flew open with ease, and Christian and Hopeful



<P>both came out.&nbsp; Then he went to the outward door that leads into



<P>the castle-yard, and, with his key, opened that door also.



<P>After, he went to the iron gate, for that must be opened too;



<P>but that lock went damnable hard, yet the key did open it.



<P>Then they thrust open the gate to make their escape with speed,



<P>but that gate, as it opened, made such a creaking, that it waked



<P>Giant Despair, who, hastily rising to pursue his prisoners,



<P>felt his limbs to fail, for his fits took him again,



<P>so that he could by no means go after them.&nbsp; Then they went on,



<P>and came to the King's highway, and so were safe, because they were



<P>out of his jurisdiction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{294}



<P>&lt;A pillar erected by Christian and his fellow>



<P>Now, when they were over the stile, they began to contrive



<P>with themselves what they should do at that stile to prevent those



<P>that should come after from falling into the hands of Giant Despair.



<P>So they consented to erect there a pillar, and to engrave upon



<P>the side thereof this sentence--"Over this stile is the way



<P>to Doubting Castle, which is kept by Giant Despair,



<P>who despiseth the King of the Celestial Country, and seeks to destroy



<P>his holy pilgrims."&nbsp; Many, therefore, that followed after



<P>read what was written, and escaped the danger.&nbsp; This done,



<P>they sang as follows:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the way we went, and then we found



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What 'twas to tread upon forbidden ground;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let them that come after have a care,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest heedlessness makes them, as we, to fare.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest they for trespassing his prisoners are,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose castle's Doubting, and whose name's Despair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{295}



<P>&lt;The Delectable Mountains>



<P>They went then till they came to the Delectable Mountains,



<P>which mountains belong to the Lord of that hill of which



<P>we have spoken before; so they went up to the mountains,



<P>to behold the gardens and orchards, the vineyards and fountains



<P>of water; where also they drank and washed themselves,



<P>and did freely eat of the vineyards.&nbsp; &lt;They are refreshed



<P>in the mountains>&nbsp; Now there were on the tops of these mountains



<P>Shepherds feeding their flocks, and they stood by the highway side.



<P>&lt;Talk with the Shepherds>&nbsp; The Pilgrims therefore went to them,



<P>and leaning upon their staves, (as is common with weary pilgrims



<P>when they stand to talk with any by the way), they asked,



<P>Whose Delectable Mountains are these?&nbsp; And whose be the sheep



<P>that feed upon them?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mountains delectable they now ascend,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Shepherds be, which to them do commend



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alluring things, and things that cautious are,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pilgrims are steady kept by faith and fear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{296}



<P>SHEP.&nbsp; These mountains are Immanuel's Land, and they are within

sight



<P>of his city; and the sheep also are his, and he laid down his life



<P>for them.&nbsp; [John 10:11]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Is this the way to the Celestial City?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>SHEP.&nbsp; You are just in your way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; How far is it thither?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>SHEP.&nbsp; Too far for any but those that shall get thither indeed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Is the way safe or dangerous?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>SHEP.&nbsp; Safe for those for whom it is to be safe; but the transgressors



<P>shall fall therein.&nbsp; [Hos. 14:9]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Is there, in this place, any relief for pilgrims



<P>that are weary and faint in the way?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>SHEP.&nbsp; The Lord of these mountains hath given us a charge not to

be



<P>forgetful to entertain strangers, therefore the good of the place



<P>is before you.&nbsp; [Heb. 13:1-2]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{297}



<P>&lt;The Shepherds welcome them>



<P>I saw also in my dream, that when the Shepherds perceived



<P>that they were wayfaring men, they also put questions to them,



<P>to which they made answer as in other places; as, Whence came you?



<P>and, How got you into the way? and, By what means have you



<P>so persevered therein?&nbsp; For but few of them that begin to come

hither



<P>do show their face on these mountains.&nbsp; But when the Shepherds

heard



<P>their answers, being pleased therewith, they looked very lovingly



<P>upon them, and said, Welcome to the Delectable Mountains.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{298}



<P>&lt;The names of the Shepherds>



<P>The Shepherds, I say, whose names were Knowledge, Experience, Watchful,



<P>and Sincere, took them by the hand, and had them to their tents,



<P>and made them partake of that which was ready at present.



<P>They said, moreover, We would that ye should stay here awhile,



<P>to be acquainted with us; and yet more to solace yourselves



<P>with the good of these Delectable Mountains.&nbsp; They then told them,



<P>that they were content to stay; so they went to their rest that night,



<P>because it was very late.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{299}



<P>&lt;They are shown wonders>



<P>Then I saw in my dream, that in the morning the Shepherds called up



<P>to Christian and Hopeful to walk with them upon the mountains;



<P>so they went forth with them, and walked a while,



<P>having a pleasant prospect on every side.&nbsp; Then said the Shepherds



<P>one to another, Shall we show these pilgrims some wonders?



<P>&lt;The Mountain of Error>&nbsp; So when they had concluded to do it,



<P>they had them first to the top of a hill called Error,



<P>which was very steep on the furthest side, and bid them look down



<P>to the bottom.&nbsp; So Christian and Hopeful looked down,



<P>and saw at the bottom several men dashed all to pieces by a fall



<P>that they had from the top.&nbsp; Then said Christian, What meaneth

this?



<P>The Shepherds answered, Have you not heard of them that were made to

err



<P>by hearkening to Hymeneus and Philetus as concerning the faith



<P>of the resurrection of the body?&nbsp; [2 Tim. 2:17,18]&nbsp; They answered,

Yes.



<P>Then said the Shepherds, Those that you see lie dashed in pieces



<P>at the bottom of this mountain are they; and they have continued



<P>to this day unburied, as you see, for an example to others



<P>to take heed how they clamber too high, or how they come too near



<P>the brink of this mountain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{300}



<P>&lt;Mount Caution>



<P>Then I saw that they had them to the top of another mountain,



<P>and the name of that is Caution, and bid them look afar off;



<P>which, when they did, they perceived, as they thought,



<P>several men walking up and down among the tombs that were there;



<P>and they perceived that the men were blind, because they



<P>stumbled sometimes upon the tombs, and because they could not get out



<P>from among them.&nbsp; Then said Christian, What means this?

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS From This World To That Which Is

To Come</FONT>

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>DELIVERED UNDER THE SIMILITUDE OF A DREAM BY JOHN BUNYAN

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Author's Apology

for his Book</B>

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{1}



<P>When at the first I took my pen in hand



<P>Thus for to write, I did not understand



<P>That I at all should make a little book



<P>In such a mode; nay, I had undertook



<P>To make another; which, when almost done,



<P>Before I was aware, I this begun.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And thus it was:&nbsp; I, writing of the way



<P>And race of saints, in this our gospel day,



<P>Fell suddenly into an allegory



<P>About their journey, and the way to glory,



<P>In more than twenty things which I set down.



<P>This done, I twenty more had in my crown;



<P>And they again began to multiply,



<P>Like sparks that from the coals of fire do fly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nay, then, thought I, if that you breed so fast,



<P>I'll put you by yourselves, lest you at last



<P>Should prove ad infinitum, and eat out



<P>The book that I already am about.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, so I did; but yet I did not think



<P>To shew to all the world my pen and ink



<P>In such a mode; I only thought to make



<P>I knew not what; nor did I undertake



<P>Thereby to please my neighbour:&nbsp; no, not I;



<P>I did it my own self to gratify.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{2}



<P>Neither did I but vacant seasons spend



<P>In this my scribble; nor did I intend



<P>But to divert myself in doing this



<P>From worser thoughts which make me do amiss.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thus, I set pen to paper with delight,



<P>And quickly had my thoughts in black and white.



<P>For, having now my method by the end,



<P>Still as I pulled, it came; and so I penned



<P>It down:&nbsp; until it came at last to be,



<P>For length and breadth, the bigness which you see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, when I had thus put mine ends together,



<P>I shewed them others, that I might see whether



<P>They would condemn them, or them justify:



<P>And some said, Let them live; some, Let them die;



<P>Some said, JOHN, print it; others said, Not so;



<P>Some said, It might do good; others said, No.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now was I in a strait, and did not see



<P>Which was the best thing to be done by me:



<P>At last I thought, Since you are thus divided,



<P>I print it will, and so the case decided.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{3}



<P>For, thought I, some, I see, would have it done,



<P>Though others in that channel do not run:



<P>To prove, then, who advised for the best,



<P>Thus I thought fit to put it to the test.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I further thought, if now I did deny



<P>Those that would have it, thus to gratify.



<P>I did not know but hinder them I might



<P>Of that which would to them be great delight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For those which were not for its coming forth,



<P>I said to them, Offend you I am loth,



<P>Yet, since your brethren pleased with it be,



<P>Forbear to judge till you do further see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If that thou wilt not read, let it alone;



<P>Some love the meat, some love to pick the bone.



<P>Yea, that I might them better palliate,



<P>I did too with them thus expostulate:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{4}



<P>May I not write in such a style as this?



<P>In such a method, too, and yet not miss



<P>My end--thy good?&nbsp; Why may it not be done?



<P>Dark clouds bring waters, when the bright bring none.



<P>Yea, dark or bright, if they their silver drops



<P>Cause to descend, the earth, by yielding crops,



<P>Gives praise to both, and carpeth not at either,



<P>But treasures up the fruit they yield together;



<P>Yea, so commixes both, that in her fruit



<P>None can distinguish this from that:&nbsp; they suit



<P>Her well when hungry; but, if she be full,



<P>She spews out both, and makes their blessings null.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>You see the ways the fisherman doth take



<P>To catch the fish; what engines doth he make?



<P>Behold how he engageth all his wits;



<P>Also his snares, lines, angles, hooks, and nets;



<P>Yet fish there be, that neither hook, nor line,



<P>Nor snare, nor net, nor engine can make thine:



<P>They must be groped for, and be tickled too,



<P>Or they will not be catch'd, whate'er you do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How does the fowler seek to catch his game



<P>By divers means! all which one cannot name:



<P>His guns, his nets, his lime-twigs, light, and bell:



<P>He creeps, he goes, he stands; yea, who can tell



<P>Of all his postures?&nbsp; Yet there's none of these



<P>Will make him master of what fowls he please.



<P>Yea, he must pipe and whistle to catch this,



<P>Yet, if he does so, that bird he will miss.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If that a pearl may in a toad's head dwell,



<P>And may be found too in an oyster-shell;



<P>If things that promise nothing do contain



<P>What better is than gold; who will disdain,



<P>That have an inkling of it, there to look,



<P>That they may find it?&nbsp; Now, my little book,



<P>(Though void of all these paintings that may make



<P>It with this or the other man to take)



<P>Is not without those things that do excel



<P>What do in brave but empty notions dwell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{5}



<P>`Well, yet I am not fully satisfied,



<P>That this your book will stand, when soundly tried.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Why, what's the matter?&nbsp; `It is dark.'&nbsp; What though?



<P>`But it is feigned.'&nbsp; What of that?&nbsp; I trow?



<P>Some men, by feigned words, as dark as mine,



<P>Make truth to spangle and its rays to shine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>`But they want solidness.'&nbsp; Speak, man, thy mind.



<P>`They drown the weak; metaphors make us blind.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Solidity, indeed, becomes the pen



<P>Of him that writeth things divine to men;



<P>But must I needs want solidness, because



<P>By metaphors I speak?&nbsp; Were not God's laws,



<P>His gospel laws, in olden times held forth



<P>By types, shadows, and metaphors?&nbsp; Yet loth



<P>Will any sober man be to find fault



<P>With them, lest he be found for to assault



<P>The highest wisdom.&nbsp; No, he rather stoops,



<P>And seeks to find out what by pins and loops,



<P>By calves and sheep, by heifers and by rams,



<P>By birds and herbs, and by the blood of lambs,



<P>God speaketh to him; and happy is he



<P>That finds the light and grace that in them be.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{6}



<P>Be not too forward, therefore, to conclude



<P>That I want solidness--that I am rude;



<P>All things solid in show not solid be;



<P>All things in parables despise not we;



<P>Lest things most hurtful lightly we receive,



<P>And things that good are, of our souls bereave.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My dark and cloudy words, they do but hold



<P>The truth, as cabinets enclose the gold.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The prophets used much by metaphors



<P>To set forth truth; yea, who so considers



<P>Christ, his apostles too, shall plainly see,



<P>That truths to this day in such mantles be.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Am I afraid to say, that holy writ,



<P>Which for its style and phrase puts down all wit,



<P>Is everywhere so full of all these things--



<P>Dark figures, allegories?&nbsp; Yet there springs



<P>From that same book that lustre, and those rays



<P>Of light, that turn our darkest nights to days.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{7}



<P>Come, let my carper to his life now look,



<P>And find there darker lines than in my book



<P>He findeth any; yea, and let him know,



<P>That in his best things there are worse lines too.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>May we but stand before impartial men,



<P>To his poor one I dare adventure ten,



<P>That they will take my meaning in these lines



<P>Far better than his lies in silver shrines.



<P>Come, truth, although in swaddling clouts, I find,



<P>Informs the judgement, rectifies the mind;



<P>Pleases the understanding, makes the will



<P>Submit; the memory too it doth fill



<P>With what doth our imaginations please;



<P>Likewise it tends our troubles to appease.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sound words, I know, Timothy is to use,



<P>And old wives' fables he is to refuse;



<P>But yet grave Paul him nowhere did forbid



<P>The use of parables; in which lay hid



<P>That gold, those pearls, and precious stones that were



<P>Worth digging for, and that with greatest care.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Let me add one word more.&nbsp; O man of God,



<P>Art thou offended?&nbsp; Dost thou wish I had



<P>Put forth my matter in another dress?



<P>Or, that I had in things been more express?



<P>Three things let me propound; then I submit



<P>To those that are my betters, as is fit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{8}



<P>1.&nbsp; I find not that I am denied the use



<P>Of this my method, so I no abuse



<P>Put on the words, things, readers; or be rude



<P>In handling figure or similitude,



<P>In application; but, all that I may,



<P>Seek the advance of truth this or that way



<P>Denied, did I say?&nbsp; Nay, I have leave



<P>(Example too, and that from them that have



<P>God better pleased, by their words or ways,



<P>Than any man that breatheth now-a-days)



<P>Thus to express my mind, thus to declare



<P>Things unto thee that excellentest are.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2.&nbsp; I find that men (as high as trees) will write



<P>Dialogue-wise; yet no man doth them slight



<P>For writing so:&nbsp; indeed, if they abuse



<P>Truth, cursed be they, and the craft they use



<P>To that intent; but yet let truth be free



<P>To make her sallies upon thee and me,



<P>Which way it pleases God; for who knows how,



<P>Better than he that taught us first to plough,



<P>To guide our mind and pens for his design?



<P>And he makes base things usher in divine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3.&nbsp; I find that holy writ in many places



<P>Hath semblance with this method, where the cases



<P>Do call for one thing, to set forth another;



<P>Use it I may, then, and yet nothing smother



<P>Truth's golden beams:&nbsp; nay, by this method may



<P>Make it cast forth its rays as light as day.



<P>And now before I do put up my pen,



<P>I'll shew the profit of my book, and then



<P>Commit both thee and it unto that Hand



<P>That pulls the strong down, and makes weak ones stand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This book it chalketh out before thine eyes



<P>The man that seeks the everlasting prize;



<P>It shews you whence he comes, whither he goes;



<P>What he leaves undone, also what he does;



<P>It also shows you how he runs and runs,



<P>Till he unto the gate of glory comes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{9}



<P>It shows, too, who set out for life amain,



<P>As if the lasting crown they would obtain;



<P>Here also you may see the reason why



<P>They lose their labour, and like fools do die.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This book will make a traveller of thee,



<P>If by its counsel thou wilt ruled be;



<P>It will direct thee to the Holy Land,



<P>If thou wilt its directions understand:



<P>Yea, it will make the slothful active be;



<P>The blind also delightful things to see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Art thou for something rare and profitable?



<P>Wouldest thou see a truth within a fable?



<P>Art thou forgetful?&nbsp; Wouldest thou remember



<P>From New-Year's day to the last of December?



<P>Then read my fancies; they will stick like burs,



<P>And may be, to the helpless, comforters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This book is writ in such a dialect



<P>As may the minds of listless men affect:



<P>It seems a novelty, and yet contains



<P>Nothing but sound and honest gospel strains.



<P>Wouldst thou divert thyself from melancholy?



<P>Wouldst thou be pleasant, yet be far from folly?



<P>Wouldst thou read riddles, and their explanation?



<P>Or else be drowned in thy contemplation?



<P>Dost thou love picking meat?&nbsp; Or wouldst thou see



<P>A man in the clouds, and hear him speak to thee?



<P>Wouldst thou be in a dream, and yet not sleep?



<P>Or wouldst thou in a moment laugh and weep?



<P>Wouldest thou lose thyself and catch no harm,



<P>And find thyself again without a charm?



<P>Wouldst read thyself, and read thou knowest not what,



<P>And yet know whether thou art blest or not,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By reading the same lines?&nbsp; Oh, then come hither,



<P>And lay my book, thy head, and heart together.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

JOHN BUNYAN.

<P>The Shepherds then answered, Did you not see a little below



<P>these mountains a stile, that led into a meadow, on the left hand



<P>of this way?&nbsp; They answered, Yes.&nbsp; Then said the Shepherds,



<P>From that stile there goes a path that leads directly



<P>to Doubting Castle, which is kept by Giant Despair, and these,



<P>pointing to them among the tombs, came once on pilgrimage,



<P>as you do now, even till they came to that same stile;



<P>and because the right way was rough in that place, they chose to go



<P>out of it into that meadow, and there were taken by Giant Despair,



<P>and cast into Doubting Castle; where, after they had been a while



<P>kept in the dungeon, he at last did put out their eyes,



<P>and led them among those tombs, where he has left them to wander



<P>to this very day, that the saying of the wise man might be fulfilled,



<P>"He that wandereth out of the way of understanding, shall remain in



<P>the congregation of the dead."&nbsp; [Pro. 21:16]&nbsp; Then Christian

and Hopeful



<P>looked upon one another, with tears gushing out, but yet said nothing



<P>to the Shepherds.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{302}



<P>&lt;A by-way to hell>



<P>Then I saw in my dream, that the Shepherds had them to another place,



<P>in a bottom, where was a door in the side of a hill,



<P>and they opened the door, and bid them look in.&nbsp; They looked in,



<P>therefore, and saw that within it was very dark and smoky;



<P>they also thought that they heard there a rumbling noise as of fire,



<P>and a cry of some tormented, and that they smelt the scent of brimstone.



<P>Then said Christian, What means this?&nbsp; The Shepherds told them,



<P>This is a by-way to hell, a way that hypocrites go in at; namely,



<P>such as sell their birthright, with Esau; such as sell their master,



<P>with Judas; such as blaspheme the gospel, with Alexander;



<P>and that lie and dissemble, with Ananias and Sapphira his wife.



<P>Then said Hopeful to the Shepherds, I perceive that these had on them,



<P>even every one, a show of pilgrimage, as we have now; had they not?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{303}



<P>SHEP.&nbsp; Yes, and held it a long time too.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; How far might they go on in pilgrimage in their day,



<P>since they notwithstanding were thus miserably cast away?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>SHEP.&nbsp; Some further, and some not so far, as these mountains.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said the Pilgrims one to another, We have need to cry to the Strong



<P>for strength.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>SHEP.&nbsp; Ay, and you will have need to use it, when you have it,

too.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{304}



<P>&lt;The Shepherds' perspective glass>



<P>By this time the Pilgrims had a desire to go forward,



<P>and the Shepherds a desire they should; so they walked together



<P>towards the end of the mountains.&nbsp; Then said the Shepherds



<P>one to another, Let us here show to the Pilgrims the gates



<P>of the Celestial City, if they have skill to look through



<P>our perspective glass.&nbsp; &lt;The Hill Clear>&nbsp; The Pilgrims

then



<P>lovingly accepted the motion; so they had them to the top



<P>of a high hill, called Clear, and gave them their glass to look.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{305}



<P>&lt;The fruits of servile fear>



<P>Then they essayed to look, but the remembrance of that last thing



<P>that the Shepherds had shown them, made their hands shake;



<P>by means of which impediment, they could not look steadily



<P>through the glass; yet they thought they saw something like the gate,



<P>and also some of the glory of the place.&nbsp; Then they went away,



<P>and sang this song--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, by the Shepherds, secrets are reveal'd,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which from all other men are kept conceal'd.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come to the Shepherds, then, if you would see



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things deep, things hid, and that mysterious

be.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{306}



<P>&lt;A twofold caution>



<P>When they were about to depart, one of the Shepherds gave them a note



<P>of the way.&nbsp; Another of them bid them beware of the Flatterer.



<P>The third bid them take heed that they sleep not upon



<P>the Enchanted Ground.&nbsp; And the fourth bid them God-speed.



<P>So I awoke from my dream.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{307}



<P>&lt;The Country of Conceit, out of which came Ignorance>



<P>And I slept, and dreamed again, and saw the same two Pilgrims



<P>going down the mountains along the highway towards the city.



<P>Now, a little below these mountains, on the left hand,



<P>lieth the country of Conceit; from which country there comes



<P>into the way in which the Pilgrims walked, a little crooked lane.



<P>Here, therefore, they met with a very brisk lad, that came out



<P>of that country; and his name was Ignorance.&nbsp; So Christian asked

him



<P>from what parts he came, and whither he was going.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{308}



<P>&lt;Christian and Ignorance have some talk>



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; Sir, I was born in the country that lieth off there



<P>a little on the left hand, and I am going to the Celestial City.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But how do you think to get in at the gate? for you may find



<P>some difficulty there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; As other people do, said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But what have you to show at that gate, that may cause



<P>that the gate should be opened to you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;The ground of Ignorance's hope>



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; I know my Lord's will, and I have been a good liver;



<P>I pay every man his own; I pray, fast, pay tithes, and give alms,



<P>and have left my country for whither I am going.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{309}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But thou camest not in at the wicket-gate that is at the

head



<P>of this way; thou camest in hither through that same crooked lane,



<P>and therefore, I fear, however thou mayest think of thyself,



<P>when the reckoning day shall come, thou wilt have laid to thy charge



<P>that thou art a thief and a robber, instead of getting admittance



<P>into the city.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;He saith to every one that he is a fool>



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; Gentlemen, ye be utter strangers to me, I know you not;



<P>be content and follow the religion of your country, and I will follow



<P>the religion of mine.&nbsp; I hope all will be well.&nbsp; And as for

the gate



<P>that you talk of, all the world knows that that is a great way off



<P>of our country.&nbsp; I cannot think that any man in all our parts



<P>doth so much as know the way to it, nor need they matter



<P>whether they do or no, since we have, as you see, a fine,



<P>pleasant green lane, that comes down from our country,



<P>the next way into the way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{310}



<P>&lt;How to carry it to a fool>



<P>When Christian saw that the man was "wise in his own conceit",



<P>he said to Hopeful, whisperingly, "There is more hope of a fool than



<P>of him."&nbsp; [Prov. 26:12]&nbsp; And said, moreover, "When he that

is a fool



<P>walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one



<P>that he is a fool."&nbsp; [Eccl. 10:3]&nbsp; What, shall we talk further

with him,



<P>or out-go him at present, and so leave him to think of what



<P>he hath heard already, and then stop again for him afterwards,



<P>and see if by degrees we can do any good to him?&nbsp; Then said Hopeful--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let Ignorance a little while now muse



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On what is said, and let him not refuse



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good counsel to embrace, lest he remain



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still ignorant of what's the chiefest gain.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God saith, those that no understanding have,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he made them, them he will not save.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; He further added, It is not good, I think, to say all to

him



<P>at once; let us pass him by, if you will, and talk to him anon,



<P>even as he is able to bear it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{311}



<P>&lt;The destruction of one Turn-away>



<P>So they both went on, and Ignorance he came after.&nbsp; Now when they

had



<P>passed him a little way, they entered into a very dark lane,



<P>where they met a man whom seven devils had bound with



<P>seven strong cords, and were carrying of him back to the door



<P>that they saw on the side of the hill.&nbsp; [Matt. 12:45, Prov. 5:22]



<P>Now good Christian began to tremble, and so did Hopeful his companion;



<P>yet as the devils led away the man, Christian looked to see



<P>if he knew him; and he thought it might be one Turn-away,



<P>that dwelt in the town of Apostasy.&nbsp; But he did not perfectly see



<P>his face, for he did hang his head like a thief that is found.



<P>But being once past, Hopeful looked after him, and espied on his back



<P>a paper with this inscription, "Wanton professor and damnable apostate".



<P>&lt;Christian telleth his companion a story of Little-faith>



<P>Then said Christian to his fellow, Now I call to remembrance,



<P>that which was told me of a thing that happened to a good man hereabout.



<P>The name of the man was Little-faith, but a good man, and he dwelt



<P>in the town of Sincere.&nbsp; The thing was this:--&nbsp; At the entering

in



<P>at this passage, &lt;Broad-way Gate> there comes down from Broad-way

Gate,



<P>&lt;Dead Man's Lane> a lane called Dead Man's Lane; so called because

of



<P>the murders that are commonly done there; and this Little-faith



<P>going on pilgrimage, as we do now, chanced to sit down there, and slept.



<P>Now there happened, at that time, to come down the lane,



<P>from Broad-way Gate, three sturdy rogues, and their names



<P>were Faint-heart, Mistrust, and Guilt, (three brothers),



<P>and they espying Little-faith, where he was, came galloping up



<P>with speed.&nbsp; Now the good man was just awake from his sleep,



<P>and was getting up to go on his journey.&nbsp; So they came up all to

him,



<P>and with threatening language bid him stand.&nbsp; At this



<P>Little-faith looked as white as a clout, and had neither power to fight



<P>nor fly.&nbsp; &lt;Little-faith robbed by Faint-heart, Mistrust and

Guilt>



<P>Then said Faint-heart, Deliver thy purse.&nbsp; &lt;They got away his

silver,



<P>and knocked him down>&nbsp; But he making no haste to do it



<P>(for he was loath to lose his money), Mistrust ran up to him,



<P>and thrusting his hand into his pocket, pulled out thence



<P>a bag of silver.&nbsp; Then he cried out, Thieves! Thieves!&nbsp; With

that Guilt,



<P>with a great club that was in his hand, struck Little-faith on the head,



<P>and with that blow felled him flat to the ground, where he lay bleeding



<P>as one that would bleed to death.&nbsp; All this while the thieves stood

by.



<P>But, at last, they hearing that some were upon the road,



<P>and fearing lest it should be one Great-grace, that dwells in the city



<P>of Good-confidence, they betook themselves to their heels,



<P>and left this good man to shift for himself.&nbsp; Now, after a while,



<P>Little-faith came to himself, and getting up, made shift



<P>to scrabble on his way.&nbsp; This was the story.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{312}



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But did they take from him all that ever he had?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Little-faith lost not his best things>



<P>Chr. No; the place where his jewels were they never ransacked,



<P>so those he kept still.&nbsp; But, as I was told, the good man



<P>was much afflicted for his loss, for the thieves got most of



<P>his spending-money.&nbsp; &lt;Little-faith forced to beg to his journey's

end>



<P>That which they got not (as I said) were jewels, also he had



<P>a little odd money left, but scarce enough to bring him to



<P>his journey's end [1 Peter 4:18]; nay, if I was not misinformed,



<P>he was forced to beg as he went, to keep himself alive;



<P>for his jewels he might not sell.&nbsp; But beg, and do what he could,



<P>he went (as we say) with many a hungry belly the most part



<P>of the rest of the way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{313}



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But is it not a wonder they got not from him his certificate,



<P>by which he was to receive his admittance at the Celestial Gate?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;He kept not his best things by his own cunning.&nbsp; [2 Tim. 1:14]>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; It is a wonder; but they got not that, though they missed

it



<P>not through any good cunning of his; for he, being dismayed with



<P>their coming upon him, had neither power nor skill to hide anything;



<P>so it was more by good Providence than by his endeavour,



<P>that they missed of that good thing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{314}



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But it must needs be a comfort to him, that they got not



<P>his jewels from him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; It might have been great comfort to him, had he used it



<P>as he should; but they that told me the story said, that he made



<P>but little use of it all the rest of the way, and that because



<P>of the dismay that he had in the taking away his money; indeed,



<P>he forgot it a great part of the rest of his journey; and besides,



<P>when at any time it came into his mind, and he began to be



<P>comforted therewith, then would fresh thoughts of his loss come again



<P>upon him, and those thoughts would swallow up all.&nbsp; [1 Peter 1:9]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{315}



<P>&lt;He is pitied by both>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Alas! poor man! This could not but be a great grief to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Grief! ay, a grief indeed. Would it not have been so to any

of us,



<P>had we been used as he, to be robbed, and wounded too,



<P>and that in a strange place, as he was?&nbsp; It is a wonder he did

not



<P>die with grief, poor heart!&nbsp; I was told that he scattered almost



<P>all the rest of the way with nothing but doleful and bitter complaints;



<P>telling also to all that overtook him, or that he overtook in the way



<P>as he went, where he was robbed, and how; who they were that did it,



<P>and what he lost; how he was wounded, and that he hardly escaped



<P>with his life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{316}



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But it is a wonder that his necessity did not put him upon



<P>selling or pawning some of his jewels, that he might have wherewith



<P>to relieve himself in his journey.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Christian snubbeth his fellow for unadvised speaking>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Thou talkest like one upon whose head is the shell



<P>to this very day; for what should he pawn them, or to whom



<P>should he sell them?&nbsp; In all that country where he was robbed,



<P>his jewels were not accounted of; nor did he want that relief



<P>which could from thence be administered to him.&nbsp; Besides,



<P>had his jewels been missing at the gate of the Celestial City,



<P>he had (and that he knew well enough) been excluded from



<P>an inheritance there; and that would have been worse to him



<P>than the appearance and villainy of ten thousand thieves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{317}



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Why art thou so tart, my brother?&nbsp; Esau sold his birthright,



<P>and that for a mess of pottage, and that birthright was



<P>his greatest jewel; and if he, why might not Little-faith do so too?



<P>[Heb. 12:16]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;A discourse about Esau and Little-faith>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Esau did sell his birthright indeed, and so do many besides,



<P>and by so doing exclude themselves from the chief blessing,



<P>as also that caitiff did; but you must put a difference betwixt



<P>Esau and Little-faith, and also betwixt their estates.



<P>&lt;Esau was ruled by his lusts>&nbsp; Esau's birthright was typical,



<P>but Little-faith's jewels were not so; Esau's belly was his god,



<P>but Little-faith's belly was not so; Esau's want lay



<P>in his fleshly appetite, Little-faith's did not so.&nbsp; Besides,



<P>Esau could see no further than to the fulfilling of his lusts;



<P>"Behold, I am at the point to die, (said he), and what profit



<P>shall this birthright do me?"&nbsp; [Gen. 25:32]&nbsp; But Little-faith,



<P>though it was his lot to have but a little faith, was by his



<P>little faith kept from such extravagances, and made to see and prize



<P>his jewels more than to sell them, as Esau did his birthright.



<P>&lt;Esau never had faith>&nbsp; You read not anywhere that Esau had

faith, no,



<P>not so much as a little; therefore, no marvel if, where the flesh only



<P>bears sway, (as it will in that man where no faith is to resist),



<P>if he sells his birthright, and his soul and all, and that to



<P>the devil of hell; for it is with such, as it is with the ass,



<P>who in her occasions cannot be turned away.&nbsp; [Jer. 2:24]



<P>When their minds are set upon their lusts, they will have them



<P>whatever they cost.&nbsp; &lt;Little-faith could not live upon Esau's

pottage>



<P>But Little-faith was of another temper, his mind was on things divine;



<P>his livelihood was upon things that were spiritual, and from above;



<P>therefore, to what end should he that is of such a temper



<P>sell his jewels (had there been any that would have bought them)



<P>to fill his mind with empty things?&nbsp; &lt;A comparison between



<P>the turtle-dove and the crow>&nbsp; Will a man give a penny to fill

his belly



<P>with hay; or can you persuade the turtle-dove to live upon carrion



<P>like the crow?&nbsp; Though faithless ones can, for carnal lusts, pawn,



<P>or mortgage, or sell what they have, and themselves outright to boot;



<P>yet they that have faith, saving faith, though but a little of it,



<P>cannot do so.&nbsp; Here, therefore, my brother, is thy mistake.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{318}



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I acknowledge it; but yet your severe reflection



<P>had almost made me angry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, I did but compare thee to some of the birds that are



<P>of the brisker sort, who will run to and fro in untrodden paths,



<P>with the shell upon their heads; but pass by that, and consider



<P>the matter under debate, and all shall be well betwixt thee and me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Hopeful swaggers>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But, Christian, these three fellows, I am persuaded in my

heart,



<P>are but a company of cowards; would they have run else, think you,



<P>as they did, at the noise of one that was coming on the road?



<P>Why did not Little-faith pluck up a greater heart?&nbsp; He might, methinks,



<P>have stood one brush with them, and have yielded when



<P>there had been no remedy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;No great heart for God, where there is but little faith>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; That they are cowards, many have said, but few have found

it so



<P>in the time of trial.&nbsp; As for a great heart, Little-faith had none;



<P>and I perceive by thee, my brother, hadst thou been the man concerned,



<P>thou art but for a brush, and then to yield.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;We have more courage when out, than when in the conflict>



<P>And, verily, since this is the height of thy stomach,



<P>now they are at a distance from us, should they appear to thee



<P>as they did to him they might put thee to second thoughts.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{319}



<P>&lt;Christian tells his own experience in this case>



<P>But, consider again, they are but journeymen thieves,



<P>they serve under the king of the bottomless pit, who, if need be,



<P>will come into their aid himself, and his voice is as



<P>the roaring of a lion.&nbsp; [1 Pet. 5:8]&nbsp; I myself have been engaged



<P>as this Little-faith was, and I found it a terrible thing.



<P>These three villains set upon me, and I beginning, like a Christian,



<P>to resist, they gave but a call, and in came their master.&nbsp; I would,



<P>as the saying is, have given my life for a penny, but that,



<P>as God would have it, I was clothed with armour of proof.



<P>Ay, and yet, though I was so harnessed, I found it hard work



<P>to quit myself like a man.&nbsp; No man can tell what in that combat



<P>attends us, but he that hath been in the battle himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{320}



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Well, but they ran, you see, when they did but suppose



<P>that one Great-grace was in the way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;The King's champion>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; True, they have often fled, both they and their master,



<P>when Great-grace hath but appeared; and no marvel; for he is



<P>the King's champion.&nbsp; But, I trow, you will put some difference

betwixt



<P>Little-faith and the King's champion.&nbsp; All the King's subjects

are not



<P>his champions, nor can they, when tried, do such feats of war as he.



<P>Is it meet to think that a little child should handle Goliath



<P>as David did?&nbsp; Or that there should be the strength of an ox in

a wren?



<P>Some are strong, some are weak; some have great faith, some have little.



<P>This man was one of the weak, and therefore he went to the wall.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{321}



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I would it had been Great-grace for their sakes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; If it had been, he might have had his hands full;



<P>for I must tell you, that though Great-grace is excellent good



<P>at his weapons, and has, and can, so long as he keeps them



<P>at sword's point, do well enough with them; yet, if they get within

him,



<P>even Faint-heart, Mistrust, or the other, it shall go hard



<P>but they will throw up his heels.&nbsp; And when a man is down, you

know,



<P>what can he do?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{322}



<P>Whoso looks well upon Great-grace's face, shall see those scars



<P>and cuts there, that shall easily give demonstration of what I say.



<P>Yea, once I heard that he should say, (and that when he



<P>was in the combat), "We despaired even of life."&nbsp; How did these



<P>sturdy rogues and their fellows make David groan, mourn, and roar?



<P>Yea, Heman, and Hezekiah, too, though champions in their day,



<P>were forced to bestir them, when by these assaulted; and yet,



<P>notwithstanding, they had their coats soundly brushed by them.&nbsp;

Peter,



<P>upon a time, would go try what he could do; but though some do say



<P>of him that he is the prince of the apostles, they handled him so,



<P>that they made him at last afraid of a sorry girl.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{323}



<P>&lt;Leviathan's sturdiness>



<P>Besides, their king is at their whistle.&nbsp; He is never out of hearing;



<P>and if at any time they be put to the worst, he, if possible,



<P>comes in to help them; and of him it is said, The sword of him



<P>that layeth at him cannot hold the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon;



<P>he esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.&nbsp; The arrow

cannot



<P>make him flee; sling stones are turned with him into stubble.



<P>Darts are counted as stubble:&nbsp; he laugheth at the shaking of a

spear.



<P>[Job 41:26-29]&nbsp; What can a man do in this case?&nbsp; &lt;The excellent

mettle



<P>that is in Job's horse>&nbsp; It is true, if a man could, at every turn,



<P>have Job's horse, and had skill and courage to ride him,



<P>he might do notable things; for his neck is clothed with thunder,



<P>he will not be afraid of the grasshopper; the glory of his nostrils



<P>is terrible: he paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength,



<P>he goeth on to meet the armed men.&nbsp; He mocketh at fear,



<P>and is not affrighted, neither turneth he back from the sword.



<P>The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear, and the shield.



<P>He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage, neither believeth

he



<P>that it is the sound of the trumpet.&nbsp; He saith among the trumpets,



<P>Ha, ha! and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of



<P>the captains, and the shouting.&nbsp; [Job 39:19-25]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{324}



<P>But for such footmen as thee and I are, let us never desire to meet

with



<P>an enemy, nor vaunt as if we could do better, when we hear of others



<P>that they have been foiled, Nor be tickled at the thoughts



<P>of our own manhood; for such commonly come by the worst when tried.



<P>Witness Peter, of whom I made mention before.&nbsp; He would swagger,

ay,



<P>he would; he would, as his vain mind prompted him to say, do better,



<P>and stand more for his Master than all men; but who so foiled,



<P>and run down by these villains, as he?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When, therefore, we hear that such robberies are done on



<P>the King's highway, two things become us to do:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{325}



<P>1.&nbsp; To go out harnessed, and to be sure to take a shield with us;



<P>for it was for want of that, that he that laid so lustily at Leviathan



<P>could not make him yield; for, indeed, if that be wanting,



<P>he fears us not at all.&nbsp; Therefore, he that had skill hath said,



<P>"Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able



<P>to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked."&nbsp; [Eph. 6:16]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{326}



<P>&lt;It is good to have a convoy>



<P>2.&nbsp; It is good, also, that we desire of the King a convoy,



<P>yea, that he will go with us himself.&nbsp; This made David rejoice



<P>when in the Valley of the Shadow of Death; and Moses was rather



<P>for dying where he stood, than to go one step without his God.



<P>[Exo. 33:15]&nbsp; Oh, my brother, if he will but go along with us,



<P>what need we be afraid of ten thousands that shall set themselves



<P>against us?&nbsp; [Ps. 3:5-8, 27:1-3]&nbsp; But, without him, the proud

helpers



<P>"fall under the slain".&nbsp; [Isa. 10:4]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{327}



<P>I, for my part, have been in the fray before now; and though,



<P>through the goodness of him that is best, I am, as you see, alive,



<P>yet I cannot boast of my manhood.&nbsp; Glad shall I be, if I meet with



<P>no more such brunts; though I fear we are not got beyond all danger.



<P>However, since the lion and the bear have not as yet devoured me,



<P>I hope God will also deliver us from the next uncircumcised Philistine.



<P>Then sang Christian--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Little-faith!&nbsp; Hast been among the

thieves?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wast robb'd?&nbsp; Remember this, whoso believes,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And gets more faith, shall then a victor be



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over ten thousand, else scarce over three.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{328}



<P>&lt;A way, and a way>



<P>So they went on and Ignorance followed.&nbsp; They went then till they

came



<P>at a place where they saw a way put itself into their way,



<P>and seemed withal to lie as straight as the way which they should go:



<P>and here they knew not which of the two to take, for both seemed



<P>straight before them; therefore, here they stood still to consider.



<P>&lt;The Flatterer finds them>&nbsp; And as they were thinking about

the way,



<P>behold a man, black of flesh, but covered with a very light robe,



<P>came to them, and asked them why they stood there.&nbsp; They answered



<P>they were going to the Celestial City, but knew not which of these ways



<P>to take.&nbsp; Follow me, said the man, it is thither that I am going.



<P>&lt;Christian and his fellow deluded>&nbsp; So they followed him in

the way



<P>that but now came into the road, which by degrees turned,



<P>and turned them so from the city that they desired to go to,



<P>that, in little time, their faces were turned away from it;



<P>yet they followed him.&nbsp; But by and by, before they were aware,



<P>he led them both within the compass of a net, in which they were both



<P>so entangled that they knew not what to do; and with that



<P>the white robe fell off the black man's back.&nbsp; &lt;They are taken

in a net>



<P>Then they saw where they were.&nbsp; Wherefore, there they lay crying



<P>some time, for they could not get themselves out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{329}



<P>&lt;They bewail their condition>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian to his fellow, Now do I see myself in

error.



<P>Did not the Shepherds bid us beware of the flatterers?



<P>As is the saying of the wise man, so we have found it this day.



<P>A man that flattereth his neighbour, spreadeth a net for his feet.



<P>[Prov. 29:5]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;A Shining One comes to them with a whip in his hand>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; They also gave us a note of directions about the way,



<P>for our more sure finding thereof; but therein we have also forgotten



<P>to read, and have not kept ourselves from the paths of the destroyer.



<P>Here David was wiser than we; for, saith he, "Concerning the works



<P>of men, by the word of thy lips, I have kept me from the paths



<P>of the destroyer."&nbsp; [Ps. 17:4]&nbsp; Thus they lay bewailing themselves



<P>in the net.&nbsp; At last they espied a Shining One coming towards them



<P>with a whip of small cord in his hand.&nbsp; When he was come



<P>to the place where they were, he asked them whence they came,



<P>and what they did there.&nbsp; They told him that they were poor pilgrims



<P>going to Zion, but were led out of their way by a black man,



<P>clothed in white, who bid us, said they, follow him,



<P>for he was going thither too.&nbsp; Then said he with the whip,



<P>It is Flatterer, a false apostle, that hath transformed himself



<P>into an angel of light.&nbsp; [Prov. 29:5, Dan. 11:32, 2 Cor. 11:13,14]



<P>So he rent the net, and let the men out.&nbsp; Then said he to them,



<P>Follow me, that I may set you in your way again.&nbsp; So he led them

back



<P>to the way which they had left to follow the Flatterer.



<P>Then he asked them, saying, Where did you lie the last night?



<P>They said, With the Shepherds upon the Delectable Mountains.



<P>&lt;They are examined, and convicted of forgetfulness>&nbsp; He asked

them then



<P>if they had not of those Shepherds a note of direction for the way.



<P>They answered, Yes.&nbsp; But did you, said he, when you were at a stand,



<P>pluck out and read your note?&nbsp; They answered, No.&nbsp; He asked

them, Why?



<P>They said, they forgot.&nbsp; He asked, moreover, if the Shepherds did

not



<P>bid them beware of the Flatterer?&nbsp; &lt;Deceivers fine spoken>



<P>They answered, Yes, but we did not imagine, said they,



<P>that this fine-spoken man had been he.&nbsp; [Rom. 16:18]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{330}



<P>&lt;They are whipped and sent on their way>



<P>Then I saw in my dream that he commanded them to lie down; which,



<P>when they did, he chastised them sore, to teach them the good way



<P>wherein they should walk [Deut. 25:2]; and as he chastised them he said,



<P>"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous, therefore,



<P>and repent."&nbsp; [2 Chron. 6:26,27, Rev. 3:19]&nbsp; This done, he

bid them



<P>go on their way, and take good heed to the other directions



<P>of the shepherds.&nbsp; So they thanked him for all his kindness,



<P>and went softly along the right way, singing--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come hither, you that walk along the way;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See how the pilgrims fare that go astray.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They catched are in an entangling net,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cause they good counsel lightly did forget:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis true they rescued were, but yet you see,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They're scourged to boot.&nbsp; Let this your

caution be.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{331}



<P>Now, after a while, they perceived, afar off, one coming softly



<P>and alone, all along the highway to meet them.&nbsp; Then said Christian



<P>to his fellow, Yonder is a man with his back towards Zion,



<P>and he is coming to meet us.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;The Atheist meets them>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I see him; let us take heed to ourselves now,



<P>lest he should prove a flatterer also.&nbsp; So he drew nearer and nearer,



<P>and at last came up unto them.&nbsp; His name was Atheist,



<P>and he asked them whither they were going.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; We are going to Mount Zion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;He laughs at them>



<P>Then Atheist fell into a very great laughter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; What is the meaning of your laughter?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{332}



<P>ATHEIST.&nbsp; I laugh to see what ignorant persons you are,



<P>to take upon you so tedious a journey, and you are like to have



<P>nothing but your travel for your pains.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;They reason together>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, man, do you think we shall not be received?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>ATHEIST.&nbsp; Received!&nbsp; There is no such place as you dream of



<P>in all this world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But there is in the world to come.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{333}



<P>ATHEIST.&nbsp; When I was at home in mine own country, I heard as you



<P>now affirm, and from that hearing went out to see, and have been



<P>seeking this city this twenty years; but find no more of it



<P>than I did the first day I set out.&nbsp; [Jer. 22:12, Eccl. 10:15]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; We have both heard and believe that there is such a place



<P>to be found.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;The Atheist takes up his content in this world>



<P>ATHEIST.&nbsp; Had not I, when at home, believed, I had not come thus

far



<P>to seek; but finding none, (and yet I should, had there been such



<P>a place to be found, for I have gone to seek it further than you),



<P>I am going back again, and will seek to refresh myself with the things



<P>that I then cast away, for hopes of that which, I now see, is not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{334}



<P>&lt;Christian proveth his brother>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian to Hopeful his fellow, Is it true



<P>which this man hath said?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Hopeful's gracious answer>



<P>Hope. Take heed, he is one of the flatterers; remember what it hath



<P>cost us once already for our hearkening to such kind of fellows.



<P>What! no Mount Zion?&nbsp; Did we not see, from the Delectable Mountains



<P>the gate of the city?&nbsp; Also, are we not now to walk by faith?



<P>Let us go on, said Hopeful, lest the man with the whip



<P>overtake us again.&nbsp; [2 Cor. 5:7]&nbsp; &lt;A remembrance of former

chastisements



<P>is a help against present temptations>&nbsp; You should have taught

me



<P>that lesson, which I will round you in the ears withal:&nbsp; "Cease,



<P>my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words



<P>of knowledge."&nbsp; [Prov. 19:27]&nbsp; I say, my brother, cease to

hear him,



<P>and let us "believe to the saving of the soul".&nbsp; [Heb. 10:39]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{335}



<P>&lt;A fruit of an honest heart>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; My brother, I did not put the question to thee for that



<P>I doubted of the truth of our belief myself, but to prove thee,



<P>and to fetch from thee a fruit of the honesty of thy heart.



<P>As for this man, I know that he is blinded by the god of this world.



<P>Let thee and I go on, knowing that we have belief of the truth,



<P>"and no lie is of the truth".&nbsp; [1 John 2:21]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Now do I rejoice in hope of the glory of God.&nbsp; So they

turned



<P>away from the man; and he, laughing at them, went his way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{336}



<P>&lt;They are come to the Enchanted Ground>



<P>I saw then in my dream, that they went till they came into



<P>a certain country, whose air naturally tended to make one drowsy,



<P>if he came a stranger into it.&nbsp; &lt;Hopeful begins to be drowsy>



<P>And here Hopeful began to be very dull and heavy of sleep;



<P>wherefore he said unto Christian, I do now begin to grow so drowsy



<P>that I can scarcely hold up mine eyes, let us lie down here



<P>and take one nap.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Christian keeps him awake>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; By no means, said the other, lest sleeping, we never awake

more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Why, my brother?&nbsp; Sleep is sweet to the labouring man;



<P>we may be refreshed if we take a nap.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Do you not remember that one of the Shepherds bid us beware



<P>of the Enchanted Ground?&nbsp; He meant by that that we should beware



<P>of sleeping; "Therefore let us not sleep, as do others,



<P>but let us watch and be sober."&nbsp; [1 Thess. 5:6]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{337}



<P>&lt;He is thankful>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I acknowledge myself in a fault, and had I been here alone



<P>I had by sleeping run the danger of death.&nbsp; I see it is true



<P>that the wise man saith, Two are better than one.&nbsp; Hitherto hath



<P>thy company been my mercy, and thou shalt have a good reward



<P>for thy labour.&nbsp; [Eccl. 9:9]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;To prevent drowsiness, they fall to good discourse>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Now then, said Christian, to prevent drowsiness in this place,



<P>let us fall into good discourse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; With all my heart, said the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Good discourse prevents drowsiness>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Where shall we begin?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Where God began with us.&nbsp; But do you begin, if you

please.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I will sing you first this song:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;The Dreamers' Note>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When saints do sleepy grow, let them

come hither,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hear how these two pilgrims talk

together:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, let them learn of them, in any wise,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus to keep ope their drowsy slumb'ring

eyes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saints' fellowship, if it be managed

well,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeps them awake, and that in spite of

hell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{338}



<P>&lt;They begin at the beginning of their conversion>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then Christian began and said, I will ask you a question.



<P>How came you to think at first of so doing as you do now?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Do you mean, how came I at first to look after



<P>the good of my soul?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, that is my meaning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I continued a great while in the delight of those things



<P>which were seen and sold at our fair; things which, I believe now,



<P>would have, had I continued in them, still drowned me



<P>in perdition and destruction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; What things are they?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Hopeful's life before conversion>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; All the treasures and riches of the world.&nbsp; Also,



<P>I delighted much in rioting, revelling, drinking, swearing, lying,



<P>uncleanness, Sabbath-breaking, and what not, that tended to



<P>destroy the soul.&nbsp; But I found at last, by hearing and considering



<P>of things that are divine, which indeed I heard of you,



<P>as also of beloved Faithful that was put to death for his faith



<P>and good living in Vanity Fair, that "the end of these things is death".



<P>[Rom.6:21-23]&nbsp; And that for these things' sake "cometh the wrath

of God



<P>upon the children of disobedience".&nbsp; [Eph.5:6]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And did you presently fall under the power of this conviction?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{339}



<P>&lt;Hopeful at first shuts his eyes against the light>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; No, I was not willing presently to know the evil of sin,



<P>nor the damnation that follows upon the commission of it;



<P>but endeavoured, when my mind at first began to be shaken with the Word,



<P>to shut mine eyes against the light thereof.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But what was the cause of your carrying of it thus



<P>to the first workings of God's blessed Spirit upon you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{340}



<P>&lt;Reasons of his resisting the light>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; The causes were, 1.&nbsp; I was ignorant that this was



<P>the work of God upon me.&nbsp; I never thought that, by awakenings for

sin,



<P>God at first begins the conversion of a sinner.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Sin was

yet



<P>very sweet to my flesh, and I was loath to leave it.&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;

I could not



<P>tell how to part with mine old companions, their presence and actions



<P>were so desirable unto me.&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; The hours in which convictions



<P>were upon me were such troublesome and such heart-affrighting hours



<P>that I could not bear, no not so much as the remembrance of them,



<P>upon my heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then, as it seems, sometimes you got rid of your trouble.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Yes, verily, but it would come into my mind again,



<P>and then I should be as bad, nay, worse, than I was before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, what was it that brought your sins to mind again?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{341}



<P>&lt;When he had lost his sense of sin, what brought this again>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Many things; as,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1.&nbsp; If I did but meet a good man in the streets; or,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2.&nbsp; If I have heard any read in the Bible; or,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3.&nbsp; If mine head did begin to ache; or,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>4.&nbsp; If I were told that some of my neighbours were sick; or,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>5.&nbsp; If I heard the bell toll for some that were dead; or,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>6.&nbsp; If I thought of dying myself; or,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>7.&nbsp; If I heard that sudden death happened to others;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>8.&nbsp; But especially, when I thought of myself, that I must quickly



<P>come to judgment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{342}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And could you at any time, with ease, get off the guilt of

sin,



<P>when by any of these ways it came upon you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; No, not I, for then they got faster hold of my conscience;



<P>and then, if I did but think of going back to sin, (though my mind



<P>was turned against it), it would be double torment to me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And how did you do then?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;When he could no longer shake off his guilt by sinful courses,



<P>then he endeavors to mend>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I thought I must endeavour to mend my life; for else, thought

I,



<P>I am sure to be damned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{343}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And did you endeavour to mend?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Yes; and fled from not only my sins, but sinful company

too;



<P>and betook me to religious duties, as prayer, reading, weeping for sin,



<P>speaking truth to my neighbours, &amp;c.&nbsp; These things did I,



<P>with many others, too much here to relate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And did you think yourself well then?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Then he thought himself well>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Yes, for a while; but at the last, my trouble came tumbling



<P>upon me again, and that over the neck of all my reformations.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{344}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; How came that about, since you were now reformed?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Reformation at last could not help, and why>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; There were several things brought it upon me,



<P>especially such sayings as these:&nbsp; "All our righteousnesses



<P>are as filthy rags."&nbsp; [Isa. 64:6]&nbsp; "By the works of the law



<P>shall no flesh be justified."&nbsp; [Gal. 2:16]&nbsp; "When ye shall

have done



<P>all those things, say, We are unprofitable", [Luke 17:10] with many

more



<P>such like.&nbsp; From whence I began to reason with myself thus:



<P>If ALL my righteousnesses are filthy rags; if, by the deeds of the law,



<P>NO man can be justified; and if, when we have done ALL,



<P>we are yet unprofitable, then it is but a folly to think of heaven



<P>by the law.&nbsp; &lt;His being a debtor by the law troubled him>



<P>I further thought thus:&nbsp; If a man runs a hundred pounds



<P>into the shopkeeper's debt, and after that shall pay for all that he



<P>shall fetch; yet, if this old debt stands still in the book uncrossed,



<P>for that the shopkeeper may sue him, and cast him into prison



<P>till he shall pay the debt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, and how did you apply this to yourself?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Why; I thought thus with myself.&nbsp; I have, by my sins,



<P>run a great way into God's book, and that my now reforming



<P>will not pay off that score; therefore I should think still,



<P>under all my present amendments, But how shall I be freed from



<P>that damnation that I have brought myself in danger of by



<P>my former transgressions?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{345}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; A very good application:&nbsp; but, pray, go on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;His espying bad things in his best duties troubled him>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Another thing that hath troubled me, even since



<P>my late amendments, is, that if I look narrowly into the best



<P>of what I do now, I still see sin, new sin, mixing itself



<P>with the best of that I do; so that now I am forced to conclude,



<P>that notwithstanding my former fond conceits of myself and duties,



<P>I have committed sin enough in one duty to send me to hell,



<P>though my former life had been faultless.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And what did you do then?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{346}



<P>&lt;This made him break his mind to Faithful, who told him the way



<P>to be saved>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Do! I could not tell what to do, until I brake my mind



<P>to Faithful, for he and I were well acquainted.&nbsp; And he told me,



<P>that unless I could obtain the righteousness of a man that never



<P>had sinned, neither mine own, nor all the righteousness of the world



<P>could save me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And did you think he spake true?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Had he told me so when I was pleased and satisfied



<P>with mine own amendment, I had called him fool for his pains;



<P>but now, since I see mine own infirmity, and the sin that cleaves



<P>to my best performance, I have been forced to be of his opinion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{347}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But did you think, when at first he suggested it to you,



<P>that there was such a man to be found, of whom it might justly be said



<P>that he never committed sin?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;At which he started at present>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I must confess the words at first sounded strangely,



<P>but after a little more talk and company with him,



<P>I had full conviction about it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And did you ask him what man this was, and how you must



<P>be justified by him?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;A more particular discovery of the way to be saved>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Yes, and he told me it was the Lord Jesus, that dwelleth

on



<P>the right hand of the Most High.&nbsp; And thus, said he, you must



<P>be justified by him, even by trusting to what he hath done by himself,



<P>in the days of his flesh, and suffered when he did hang on the tree.



<P>I asked him further, how that man's righteousness could be



<P>of that efficacy to justify another before God?&nbsp; And he told me



<P>he was the mighty God, and did what he did, and died the death also,



<P>not for himself, but for me; to whom his doings, and the worthiness



<P>of them, should be imputed, if I believed on him.&nbsp; [Heb. 10, Rom.

6,



<P>Col. 1, 1 Pet. 1]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{348}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And what did you do then?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;He doubts of acceptation>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I made my objections against my believing, for that I thought



<P>he was not willing to save me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And what said Faithful to you then?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;He is better instructed>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; He bid me go to him and see.&nbsp; Then I said it was presumption;



<P>but he said, No, for I was invited to come.&nbsp; [Matt. 11:28]



<P>Then he gave me a book of Jesus, his inditing, to encourage me



<P>the more freely to come; and he said, concerning that book,



<P>that every jot and tittle thereof stood firmer than heaven and earth.



<P>[Matt. 24:35]&nbsp; Then I asked him, What I must do when I came; and

he



<P>told me, I must entreat upon my knees, with all my heart and soul,



<P>the Father to reveal him to me.&nbsp; [Ps. 95:6, Dan. 6:10, Jer. 29:12,13]



<P>Then I asked him further, how I must make my supplication to him?



<P>And he said, Go, and thou shalt find him upon a mercy-seat,



<P>where he sits all the year long, to give pardon and forgiveness



<P>to them that come.&nbsp; I told him that I knew not what to say when

I came.



<P>&lt;He is bid to pray>&nbsp; And he bid me say to this effect:



<P>God be merciful to me a sinner, and make me to know and believe



<P>in Jesus Christ; for I see, that if his righteousness had not been,



<P>or I have not faith in that righteousness, I am utterly cast away.



<P>Lord, I have heard that thou art a merciful God, and hast ordained



<P>that thy Son Jesus Christ should be the Saviour of the world;



<P>and moreover, that thou art willing to bestow him upon



<P>such a poor sinner as I am, (and I am a sinner indeed); Lord,



<P>take therefore this opportunity and magnify thy grace



<P>in the salvation of my soul, through thy Son Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Amen.



<P>[Exo. 25:22, Lev. 16:2, Num. 7:89, Heb. 4:16]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{349}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And did you do as you were bidden?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;He prays>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Yes; over, and over, and over.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And did the Father reveal his Son to you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Not at the first, nor second, nor third, nor fourth, nor

fifth;



<P>no, nor at the sixth time neither.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; What did you do then?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; What! why I could not tell what to do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Had you not thoughts of leaving off praying?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;He thought to leave off praying>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Yes; an hundred times twice told.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And what was the reason you did not?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;He durst not leave off praying, and why>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I believed that that was true which had been told me,



<P>to wit, that without the righteousness of this Christ,



<P>all the world could not save me; and therefore, thought I with myself,



<P>if I leave off I die, and I can but die at the throne of grace.



<P>And withal, this came into my mind, "Though it tarry, wait for it;



<P>because it will surely come, it will not tarry."&nbsp; [Heb. 2:3]



<P>So I continued praying until the Father showed me his Son.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{350}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And how was he revealed unto you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Christ is revealed to him, and how>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I did not see him with my bodily eyes, but with the eyes



<P>of my understanding; [Eph. 1:18,19] and thus it was:



<P>One day I was very sad, I think sadder than at any one time in my life,



<P>and this sadness was through a fresh sight of the greatness and vileness



<P>of my sins.&nbsp; And as I was then looking for nothing but hell,



<P>and the everlasting damnation of my soul, suddenly, as I thought,



<P>I saw the Lord Jesus Christ look down from heaven upon me, and saying,



<P>"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved."



<P>[Acts 16:30,31]

<P>&lt;Apollyon casteth to the ground the Christian>



<P>Then Apollyon, espying his opportunity, began to gather up close



<P>to Christian, and wrestling with him, gave him a dreadful fall;



<P>and with that Christian's sword flew out of his hand.



<P>Then said Apollyon, I am sure of thee now.&nbsp; And with that



<P>he had almost pressed him to death, so that Christian began



<P>to despair of life; but as God would have it, while Apollyon



<P>was fetching of his last blow, thereby to make a full end



<P>of this good man, Christian nimbly stretched out his hand for his sword,



<P>and caught it, saying, "Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy;



<P>when I fall I shall arise" [Micah 7:8]; &lt;Christian's victory



<P>over Apollyon> and with that gave him a deadly thrust,



<P>which made him give back, as one that had received his mortal wound.



<P>Christian perceiving that, made at him again, saying, "Nay,



<P>in all these things we are more than conquerors through him



<P>that loved us".&nbsp; [Rom. 8:37]&nbsp; And with that Apollyon spread

forth



<P>his dragon's wings, and sped him away, that Christian for a season



<P>saw him no more.&nbsp; [James 4:7]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{152}



<P>&lt;A brief relation of the combat by the spectator>



<P>In this combat no man can imagine, unless he had seen and heard



<P>as I did, what yelling and hideous roaring Apollyon made all the time



<P>of the fight--he spake like a dragon; and, on the other side,



<P>what sighs and groans burst from Christian's heart.&nbsp; I never saw

him



<P>all the while give so much as one pleasant look, till he perceived



<P>he had wounded Apollyon with his two-edged sword; then, indeed,



<P>he did smile, and look upward; but it was the dreadfullest sight



<P>that ever I saw.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more unequal match can hardly be,--



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHRISTIAN must fight an Angel; but you see,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The valiant man by handling Sword and Shield,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth make him, tho' a Dragon, quit the field.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{153}



<P>&lt;Christian gives God thanks for deliverance>



<P>So when the battle was over, Christian said, "I will here give thanks



<P>to him that delivered me out of the mouth of the lion,



<P>to him that did help me against Apollyon."&nbsp; And so he did, saying--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great Beelzebub, the captain of this fiend,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design'd my ruin; therefore to this end



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sent him harness'd out:&nbsp; and he with

rage



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That hellish was, did fiercely me engage.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But blessed Michael helped me, and I,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By dint of sword, did quickly make him fly.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore to him let me give lasting praise,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thank and bless his holy name always.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{154}



<P>&lt;Christian goes on his journey with his sword drawn in his hand>



<P>Then there came to him a hand, with some of the leaves



<P>of the tree of life, the which Christian took, and applied to the wounds



<P>that he had received in the battle, and was healed immediately.



<P>He also sat down in that place to eat bread, and to drink of the bottle



<P>that was given him a little before; so, being refreshed,



<P>he addressed himself to his journey, with his sword drawn in his hand;



<P>for he said, I know not but some other enemy may be at hand.&nbsp; But

he met



<P>with no other affront from Apollyon quite through this valley.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{155}



<P>&lt;The Valley of the Shadow of Death>



<P>Now, at the end of this valley was another, called the Valley of



<P>the Shadow of Death, and Christian must needs go through it,



<P>because the way to the Celestial City lay through the midst of it.



<P>Now, this valley is a very solitary place.&nbsp; The prophet Jeremiah



<P>thus describes it:&nbsp; "A wilderness, a land of deserts and of pits,



<P>a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, a land that no man"



<P>(but a Christian) "passed through, and where no man dwelt."&nbsp; [Jer.

2:6]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now here Christian was worse put to it than in his fight with Apollyon,



<P>as by the sequel you shall see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{156}



<P>&lt;The children of the spies go back>



<P>I saw then in my dream, that when Christian was got to the borders of



<P>the Shadow of Death, there met him two men, children of them



<P>that brought up an evil report of the good land [Num. 13],



<P>making haste to go back; to whom Christian spake as follows:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{157}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Whither are you going?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MEN.&nbsp; They said, Back! back! and we would have you to do so too,



<P>if either life or peace is prized by you.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, what's the matter? said Christian.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MEN.&nbsp; Matter! said they; we were going that way as you are going,



<P>and went as far as we durst; and indeed we were almost past coming back;



<P>for had we gone a little further, we had not been here to bring the

news



<P>to thee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But what have you met with? said Christian.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MEN.&nbsp; Why, we were almost in the Valley of the Shadow of Death;



<P>but that, by good hap, we looked before us, and saw the danger



<P>before we came to it.&nbsp; [Ps. 44:19; 107:10]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But what have you seen? said Christian.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{158}



<P>MEN.&nbsp; Seen!&nbsp; Why, the Valley itself, which is as dark as pitch;



<P>we also saw there the hobgoblins, satyrs, and dragons of the pit;



<P>we heard also in that Valley a continual howling and yelling,



<P>as of a people under unutterable misery, who there sat bound



<P>in affliction and irons; and over that Valley hangs



<P>the discouraging clouds of confusion.&nbsp; Death also doth always



<P>spread his wings over it.&nbsp; In a word, it is every whit dreadful,



<P>being utterly without order.&nbsp; [Job 3:5; 10:22]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then, said Christian, I perceive not yet, by what you have

said,



<P>but that this is my way to the desired haven.&nbsp; [Jer. 2:6]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MEN.&nbsp; Be it thy way; we will not choose it for ours.&nbsp; So,

they parted,



<P>and Christian went on his way, but still with his sword



<P>drawn in his hand, for fear lest he should be assaulted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{159}



<P>I saw then in my dream, so far as this valley reached,



<P>there was on the right hand a very deep ditch; that ditch is it



<P>into which the blind have led the blind in all ages, and have both



<P>there miserably perished.&nbsp; [Ps. 69:14,15]&nbsp; Again, behold,



<P>on the left hand, there was a very dangerous quag, into which,



<P>if even a good man falls, he can find no bottom for his foot



<P>to stand on.&nbsp; Into that quag King David once did fall, and had

no doubt



<P>therein been smothered, had not HE that is able plucked him out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{160}



<P>The pathway was here also exceeding narrow, and therefore good Christian



<P>was the more put to it; for when he sought, in the dark,



<P>to shun the ditch on the one hand, he was ready to tip over



<P>into the mire on the other; also when he sought to escape the mire,



<P>without great carefulness he would be ready to fall into the ditch.



<P>Thus he went on, and I heard him here sigh bitterly; for,



<P>besides the dangers mentioned above, the pathway was here so dark,



<P>and ofttimes, when he lift up his foot to set forward,



<P>he knew not where or upon what he should set it next.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor man! where art thou now? thy day is night.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good man, be not cast down, thou yet art right,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy way to heaven lies by the gates of Hell;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheer up, hold out, with thee it shall go well.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{161}



<P>About the midst of this valley, I perceived the mouth of hell to be,



<P>and it stood also hard by the wayside.&nbsp; Now, thought Christian,



<P>what shall I do?&nbsp; And ever and anon the flame and smoke



<P>would come out in such abundance, with sparks and hideous noises,



<P>(things that cared not for Christian's sword, as did Apollyon before),



<P>that he was forced to put up his sword, and betake himself



<P>to another weapon called All-prayer.&nbsp;&nbsp; [Eph. 6:18]&nbsp; So

he cried



<P>in my hearing, "O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul!"&nbsp; [Ps.

116:4]



<P>Thus he went on a great while, yet still the flames would be



<P>reaching towards him.&nbsp; Also he heard doleful voices, and rushings



<P>to and fro, so that sometimes he thought he should be torn in pieces,



<P>or trodden down like mire in the streets.&nbsp; &lt;Christian put to

a stand,



<P>but for a while>&nbsp; This frightful sight was seen, and these



<P>dreadful noises were heard by him for several miles together;



<P>and, coming to a place where he thought he heard a company of fiends



<P>coming forward to meet him, he stopped, and began to muse



<P>what he had best to do.&nbsp; Sometimes he had half a thought to go

back;



<P>then again he thought he might be half way through the valley;



<P>he remembered also how he had already vanquished many a danger,



<P>and that the danger of going back might be much more than for



<P>to go forward; so he resolved to go on.&nbsp; Yet the fiends seemed

to come



<P>nearer and nearer; but when they were come even almost at him,



<P>he cried out with a most vehement voice, "I will walk in the strength



<P>of the Lord God!" so they gave back, and came no further.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{162}



<P>&lt;Christian made believe that he spake blasphemies,



<P>when it was Satan that suggested them into his mind>



<P>One thing I would not let slip.&nbsp; I took notice that now poor Christian



<P>was so confounded, that he did not know his own voice;



<P>and thus I perceived it.&nbsp; Just when he was come over against



<P>the mouth of the burning pit, one of the wicked ones got behind him,



<P>and stepped up softly to him, and whisperingly suggested



<P>many grievous blasphemies to him, which he verily thought



<P>had proceeded from his own mind.&nbsp; This put Christian more to it



<P>than anything that he met with before, even to think that he should

now



<P>blaspheme him that he loved so much before; yet, if he could



<P>have helped it, he would not have done it; but he had not the discretion



<P>either to stop his ears, or to know from whence these blasphemies came.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{163}



<P>When Christian had travelled in this disconsolate condition



<P>some considerable time, he thought he heard the voice of a man,



<P>as going before him, saying, "Though I walk through the valley



<P>of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me."



<P>[Ps. 23:4]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{164}



<P>Then he was glad, and that for these reasons:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>First, Because he gathered from thence, that some who feared God



<P>were in this valley as well as himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Secondly, For that he perceived God was with them, though in that



<P>dark and dismal state; and why not, thought he, with me? though,



<P>by reason of the impediment that attends this place,



<P>I cannot perceive it.&nbsp; [Job 9:11]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thirdly, For that he hoped, could he overtake them, to have company



<P>by and by.&nbsp; So he went on, and called to him that was before;



<P>but he knew not what to answer; for that he also thought to be alone.



<P>And by and by the day broke; then said Christian,



<P>He hath turned "the shadow of death into the morning".&nbsp; [Amos 5:8]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{165}



<P>&lt;Christian glad at break of day>



<P>Now morning being come, he looked back, not out of desire to return,



<P>but to see, by the light of the day, what hazards he had gone through



<P>in the dark.&nbsp; So he saw more perfectly the ditch that was on



<P>the one hand, and the mire that was on the other; also how narrow



<P>the way was which led betwixt them both; also now he saw the hobgoblins,



<P>and satyrs, and dragons of the pit, but all afar off,



<P>(for after break of day, they came not nigh;) yet they were discovered



<P>to him, according to that which is written, "He discovereth deep things



<P>out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death."



<P>[Job 12:22]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{166}



<P>&lt;The second part of this valley very dangerous>



<P>Now was Christian much affected with his deliverance from



<P>all the dangers of his solitary way; which dangers,



<P>though he feared them more before, yet he saw them more clearly now,



<P>because the light of the day made them conspicuous to him.



<P>And about this time the sun was rising, and this was another mercy



<P>to Christian; for you must note, that though the first part



<P>of the Valley of the Shadow of Death was dangerous,



<P>yet this second part which he was yet to go, was, if possible,



<P>far more dangerous; for from the place where he now stood,



<P>even to the end of the valley, the way was all along set so full



<P>of snares, traps, gins, and nets here, and so full of pits, pitfalls,



<P>deep holes, and shelvings down there, that, had it now been dark,



<P>as it was when he came the first part of the way,



<P>had he had a thousand souls, they had in reason been cast away;



<P>but, as I said just now, the sun was rising.&nbsp; Then said he,



<P>"His candle shineth upon my head, and by his light I walk



<P>through darkness."&nbsp; [Job 29:3]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{167}



<P>In this light, therefore, he came to the end of the valley.



<P>Now I saw in my dream, that at the end of this valley lay blood,



<P>bones, ashes, and mangled bodies of men, even of pilgrims



<P>that had gone this way formerly; and while I was musing



<P>what should be the reason, I espied a little before me a cave,



<P>where two giants, POPE and PAGAN, dwelt in old time;



<P>by whose power and tyranny the men whose bones, blood, and ashes, &amp;c.,



<P>lay there, were cruelly put to death.&nbsp; But by this place



<P>Christian went without much danger, whereat I somewhat wondered;



<P>but I have learnt since, that PAGAN has been dead many a day;



<P>and as for the other, though he be yet alive, he is, by reason of age,



<P>and also of the many shrewd brushes that he met with



<P>in his younger days, grown so crazy and stiff in his joints,



<P>that he can now do little more than sit in his cave's mouth,



<P>grinning at pilgrims as they go by, and biting his nails



<P>because he cannot come at them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{168}



<P>So I saw that Christian went on his way; yet, at the sight



<P>of the Old Man that sat in the mouth of the cave, he could not tell



<P>what to think, especially because he spake to him, though he could not



<P>go after him, saying, "You will never mend till more of you be burned."



<P>But he held his peace, and set a good face on it, and so went by



<P>and catched no hurt.&nbsp; Then sang Christian:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O world of wonders! (I can say no less),



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I should be preserved in that distress



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I have met with here!&nbsp; O blessed

be



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That hand that from it hath deliver'd me!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dangers in darkness, devils, hell, and sin



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did compass me, while I this vale was in:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, snares, and pits, and traps, and nets,

did lie



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My path about, that worthless, silly I



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Might have been catch'd, entangled, and cast

down;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But since I live, let JESUS wear the crown.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{169}



<P>Now, as Christian went on his way, he came to a little ascent,



<P>which was cast up on purpose that pilgrims might see before them.



<P>Up there, therefore, Christian went, and looking forward, he saw



<P>Faithful before him, upon his journey.&nbsp; Then said Christian aloud,



<P>"Ho! ho! So-ho! stay, and I will be your companion!"&nbsp; At that,



<P>Faithful looked behind him; to whom Christian cried again, "Stay, stay,



<P>till I come up to you!"&nbsp; But Faithful answered, "No, I am upon

my life,



<P>and the avenger of blood is behind me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{170}



<P>&lt;Christian overtakes Faithful>



<P>At this, Christian was somewhat moved, and putting to all his strength,



<P>he quickly got up with Faithful, and did also overrun him;



<P>so the last was first.&nbsp; Then did Christian vain-gloriously smile,



<P>because he had gotten the start of his brother; but not taking



<P>good heed to his feet, he suddenly stumbled and fell,



<P>and could not rise again until Faithful came up to help him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Christian's fall makes Faithful and he go lovingly together>



<P>Then I saw in my dream they went very lovingly on together,



<P>and had sweet discourse of all things that had happened to them



<P>in their pilgrimage; and thus Christian began:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{171}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; My honoured and well-beloved brother, Faithful, I am glad



<P>that I have overtaken you; and that God has so tempered our spirits,



<P>that we can walk as companions in this so pleasant a path.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; I had thought, dear friend, to have had your company



<P>quite from our town; but you did get the start of me,



<P>wherefore I was forced to come thus much of the way alone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; How long did you stay in the City of Destruction before



<P>you set out after me on your pilgrimage?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Their talk about the country from whence they came>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Till I could stay no longer; for there was great talk



<P>presently after you were gone out that our city would, in short time,



<P>with fire from heaven, be burned down to the ground.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; What! did your neighbours talk so?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Yes, it was for a while in everybody's mouth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; What! and did no more of them but you come out



<P>to escape the danger?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Though there was, as I said, a great talk thereabout,



<P>yet I do not think they did firmly believe it.&nbsp; For in the heat



<P>of the discourse, I heard some of them deridingly speak of you and of



<P>your desperate journey, (for so they called this your pilgrimage),



<P>but I did believe, and do still, that the end of our city



<P>will be with fire and and brimstone from above; and therefore



<P>I have made my escape.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{172}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Did you hear no talk of neighbour Pliable?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Yes, Christian, I heard that he followed you till he came



<P>at the Slough of Despond, where, as some said, he fell in;



<P>but he would not be known to have so done; but I am sure



<P>he was soundly bedabbled with that kind of dirt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And what said the neighbours to him?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;How Pliable was accounted of, when he got home>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; He hath, since his going back, been had greatly in derision,



<P>and that among all sorts of people; some do mock and despise him;



<P>and scarce will any set him on work.&nbsp; He is now seven times worse



<P>than if he had never gone out of the city.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But why should they be so set against him, since they also

despise



<P>the way that he forsook?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Oh, they say, hang him, he is a turncoat! he was not true



<P>to his profession.&nbsp; I think God has stirred up even his enemies

to



<P>hiss at him, and make him a proverb, because he hath forsaken the way.



<P>[Jer. 29:18,19]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Had you no talk with him before you came out?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; I met him once in the streets, but he leered away on



<P>the other side, as one ashamed of what he had done;



<P>so I spake not to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{173}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, at my first setting out, I had hopes of that man;



<P>but now I fear he will perish in the overthrow of the city;



<P>for it is happened to him according to the true proverb,



<P>"The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed,



<P>to her wallowing in the mire."&nbsp; [2 Pet. 2:22]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; These are my fears of him too; but who can hinder



<P>that which will be?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, neighbour Faithful, said Christian, let us leave him,



<P>and talk of things that more immediately concern ourselves.



<P>Tell me now, what you have met with in the way as you came;



<P>for I know you have met with some things, or else it may be writ



<P>for a wonder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{174}



<P>&lt;Faithful assaulted by Wanton>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; I escaped the Slough that I perceived you fell into,



<P>and got up to the gate without that danger; only I met with one



<P>whose name was Wanton, who had like to have done me a mischief.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; It was well you escaped her net; Joseph was hard put to it

by her,



<P>and he escaped her as you did; but it had like to have cost him



<P>his life.&nbsp; [Gen. 39:11-13]&nbsp; But what did she do to you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; You cannot think, but that you know something,



<P>what a flattering tongue she had; she lay at me hard to turn aside



<P>with her, promising me all manner of content.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Nay, she did not promise you the content of a good conscience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; You know what I mean; all carnal and fleshly content.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Thank God you have escaped her:&nbsp; "The abhorred of the

Lord



<P>shall fall into her ditch."&nbsp; [Ps. 22:14]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Nay, I know not whether I did wholly escape her or no.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, I trow, you did not consent to her desires?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; No, not to defile myself; for I remembered an old writing



<P>that I had seen, which said, "Her steps take hold on hell."&nbsp; [Prov.

5:5]



<P>So I shut mine eyes, because I would not be bewitched with her looks.



<P>[Job 31:1]&nbsp; Then she railed on me, and I went my way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Did you meet with no other assault as you came?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{175}



<P>&lt;He is assaulted by Adam the First>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; When I came to the foot of the hill called Difficulty,



<P>I met with a very aged man, who asked me what I was, and whither bound.



<P>I told him that I am a pilgrim, going to the Celestial City.



<P>Then said the old man, Thou lookest like an honest fellow;



<P>wilt thou be content to dwell with me for the wages that I shall



<P>give thee?&nbsp; Then I asked him his name, and where he dwelt.



<P>He said his name was Adam the First, and that he dwelt in the town



<P>of Deceit.&nbsp; [Eph. 4:22]&nbsp; I asked him then what was his work,



<P>and what the wages he would give.&nbsp; He told me that his work



<P>was many delights; and his wages that I should be his heir at last.



<P>I further asked him what house he kept, and what other servants he had.



<P>So he told me that his house was maintained with all the dainties



<P>in the world; and that his servants were those of his own begetting.



<P>Then I asked if he had any children.&nbsp; He said that he had



<P>but three daughters:&nbsp; The Lust of the Flesh, The Lust of the Eyes,



<P>and The Pride of Life, and that I should marry them all if I would.



<P>[1 John 2:16]&nbsp; Then I asked how long time he would have me



<P>live with him?&nbsp; And he told me, As long as he lived himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, and what conclusion came the old man and you to at

last?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Why, at first, I found myself somewhat inclinable



<P>to go with the man, for I thought he spake very fair;



<P>but looking in his forehead, as I talked with him, I saw there written,



<P>"Put off the old man with his deeds."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And how then?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{176}



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Then it came burning hot into my mind, whatever he said,



<P>and however he flattered, when he got me home to his house,



<P>he would sell me for a slave.&nbsp; So I bid him forbear to talk,



<P>for I would not come near the door of his house.&nbsp; Then he reviled

me,



<P>and told me that he would send such a one after me, that should make



<P>my way bitter to my soul.&nbsp; So I turned to go away from him;



<P>but just as I turned myself to go thence, I felt him take hold



<P>of my flesh, and give me such a deadly twitch back, that I thought



<P>he had pulled part of me after himself.&nbsp; This made me cry,



<P>"O wretched man!"&nbsp; [Rom. 7:24] So I went on my way up the hill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now when I had got about half-way up, I looked behind,



<P>and saw one coming after me, swift as the wind; so he overtook me



<P>just about the place where the settle stands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Just there, said Christian, did I sit down to rest me;



<P>but being overcome with sleep, I there lost this roll out of my bosom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{177}



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; But, good brother, hear me out.&nbsp; So soon as the man

overtook me,



<P>he was but a word and a blow, for down he knocked me,



<P>and laid me for dead.&nbsp; But when I was a little come to myself again,



<P>I asked him wherefore he served me so.&nbsp; He said, because of



<P>my secret inclining to Adam the First; and with that he struck me



<P>another deadly blow on the breast, and beat me down backward; so I lay



<P>at his foot as dead as before.&nbsp; So, when I came to myself again,



<P>I cried him mercy; but he said, I know not how to show mercy;



<P>and with that he knocked me down again.&nbsp; He had doubtless made



<P>an end of me, but that one came by, and bid him forbear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Who was that that bid him forbear?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; I did not know him at first, but as he went by,



<P>I perceived the holes in his hands and in his side;



<P>then I concluded that he was our Lord.&nbsp; So I went up the hill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{178}



<P>&lt;The temper of Moses>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; That man that overtook you was Moses.&nbsp; He spareth none,



<P>neither knoweth he how to show mercy to those that transgress his law.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; I know it very well; it was not the first time that he

has met



<P>with me.&nbsp; It was he that came to me when I dwelt securely at home,



<P>and that told me he would burn my house over my head if I stayed there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But did you not see the house that stood there on the top



<P>of the hill, on the side of which Moses met you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Yes, and the lions too, before I came at it:



<P>but for the lions, I think they were asleep, for it was about noon;



<P>and because I had so much of the day before me, I passed by the porter,



<P>and came down the hill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; He told me, indeed, that he saw you go by, but I wish



<P>you had called at the house, for they would have showed you



<P>so many rarities, that you would scarce have forgot them



<P>to the day of your death.&nbsp; But pray tell me, Did you meet nobody



<P>in the Valley of Humility?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{179}



<P>&lt;Faithful assaulted by Discontent>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Yes, I met with one Discontent, who would willingly



<P>have persuaded me to go back again with him; his reason was,



<P>for that the valley was altogether without honour.&nbsp; He told me,



<P>moreover, that there to go was the way to disobey all my friends,



<P>as Pride, Arrogancy, Self-conceit, Worldly-glory, with others,



<P>who he knew, as he said, would be very much offended,



<P>if I made such a fool of myself as to wade through this valley.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, and how did you answer him?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{180}



<P>&lt;Faithful's answer to Discontent>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; I told him, that although all these that he named might

claim



<P>kindred of me, and that rightly, for indeed they were my relations



<P>according to the flesh; yet since I became a pilgrim,



<P>they have disowned me, as I also have rejected them; and therefore



<P>they were to me now no more than if they had never been of my lineage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I told him, moreover, that as to this valley, he had quite



<P>misrepresented the thing; for before honour is humility,



<P>and a haughty spirit before a fall.&nbsp; Therefore, said I,



<P>I had rather go through this valley to the honour that was so accounted



<P>by the wisest, than choose that which he esteemed most worthy



<P>our affections.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Met you with nothing else in that valley?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{181}



<P>&lt;He is assaulted with Shame>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Yes, I met with Shame; but of all the men that I met with



<P>in my pilgrimage, he, I think, bears the wrong name.



<P>The others would be said nay, after a little argumentation,



<P>and somewhat else; but this bold-faced Shame would never have done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, what did he say to you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; What! why, he objected against religion itself;



<P>he said it was a pitiful, low, sneaking business for a man



<P>to mind religion; he said that a tender conscience was an unmanly thing;



<P>and that for a man to watch over his words and ways, so as to



<P>tie up himself from that hectoring liberty that the brave spirits



<P>of the times accustom themselves unto, would make him the ridicule



<P>of the times.&nbsp; He objected also, that but few of the mighty, rich,



<P>or wise, were ever of my opinion [1 Cor. 1:26; 3:18; Phil. 3:7,8];



<P>nor any of them neither [John 7:48], before they were persuaded



<P>to be fools, and to be of a voluntary fondness, to venture



<P>the loss of all, for nobody knows what.&nbsp; He, moreover,



<P>objected the base and low estate and condition of those



<P>that were chiefly the pilgrims of the times in which they lived:



<P>also their ignorance and want of understanding in all natural science.



<P>Yea, he did hold me to it at that rate also, about a great many



<P>more things than here I relate; as, that it was a shame to sit



<P>whining and mourning under a sermon, and a shame to come



<P>sighing and groaning home:&nbsp; that it was a shame to ask my neighbour



<P>forgiveness for petty faults, or to make restitution



<P>where I have taken from any.&nbsp; He said, also, that religion made

a man



<P>grow strange to the great, because of a few vices, which he called



<P>by finer names; and made him own and respect the base,



<P>because of the same religious fraternity.&nbsp; And is not this, said

he,



<P>a shame?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{182}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; And what did you say to him?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Say! I could not tell what to say at the first.



<P>Yea, he put me so to it, that my blood came up in my face;



<P>even this Shame fetched it up, and had almost beat me quite off.



<P>But at last I began to consider, that "that which is highly esteemed



<P>among men, is had in abomination with God."&nbsp; [Luke 16:15]



<P>And I thought again, this Shame tells me what men are;



<P>but it tells me nothing what God or the Word of God is.



<P>And I thought, moreover, that at the day of doom, we shall not be doomed



<P>to death or life according to the hectoring spirits of the world,



<P>but according to the wisdom and law of the Highest.&nbsp; Therefore,



<P>thought I, what God says is best, indeed is best, though all the men



<P>in the world are against it.&nbsp; Seeing, then, that God prefers



<P>his religion; seeing God prefers a tender conscience;



<P>seeing they that make themselves fools for the kingdom of heaven



<P>are wisest; and that the poor man that loveth Christ is richer



<P>than the greatest man in the world that hates him; Shame, depart,



<P>thou art an enemy to my salvation!&nbsp; Shall I entertain thee



<P>against my sovereign Lord?&nbsp; How then shall I look him in the face



<P>at his coming?&nbsp; Should I now be ashamed of his ways and servants,



<P>how can I expect the blessing? [Mark 8:38]&nbsp; But, indeed,



<P>this Shame was a bold villain; I could scarce shake him



<P>out of my company; yea, he would be haunting of me, and continually



<P>whispering me in the ear, with some one or other of the infirmities



<P>that attend religion; but at last I told him it was but in vain



<P>to attempt further in this business; for those things that he disdained,



<P>in those did I see most glory; and so at last I got past



<P>this importunate one.&nbsp; And when I had shaken him off,



<P>then I began to sing--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trials that those men do meet withal,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That are obedient to the heavenly call,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are manifold, and suited to the flesh,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And come, and come, and come again afresh;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That now, or sometime else, we by them may



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be taken, overcome, and cast away.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, let the pilgrims, let the pilgrims, then



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be vigilant, and quit themselves like men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{183}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I am glad, my brother, that thou didst withstand this villain



<P>so bravely; for of all, as thou sayest, I think he has the wrong name;



<P>for he is so bold as to follow us in the streets, and to attempt



<P>to put us to shame before all men:&nbsp; that is, to make us ashamed



<P>of that which is good; but if he was not himself audacious,



<P>he would never attempt to do as he does.&nbsp; But let us still resist

him;



<P>for notwithstanding all his bravadoes, he promoteth the fool



<P>and none else.&nbsp; "The wise shall inherit glory, said Solomon,



<P>but shame shall be the promotion of fools."&nbsp; [Prov. 3:35]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; I think we must cry to Him for help against Shame,



<P>who would have us to be valiant for the truth upon the earth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; You say true; but did you meet nobody else in that valley?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; No, not I; for I had sunshine all the rest of the way



<P>through that, and also through the Valley of the Shadow of Death.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{184}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; It was well for you.&nbsp; I am sure it fared far otherwise

with me;



<P>I had for a long season, as soon almost as I entered into that valley,



<P>a dreadful combat with that foul fiend Apollyon; yea, I thought verily



<P>he would have killed me, especially when he got me down



<P>and crushed me under him, as if he would have crushed me to pieces;



<P>for as he threw me, my sword flew out of my hand; nay, he told me



<P>he was sure of me:&nbsp; but I cried to God, and he heard me,



<P>and delivered me out of all my troubles.&nbsp; Then I entered into



<P>the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and had no light for almost



<P>half the way through it.&nbsp; I thought I should have been killed there,



<P>over and over; but at last day broke, and the sun rose,



<P>and I went through that which was behind with far more ease and quiet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{185}



<P>&lt;Talkative described>



<P>Moreover, I saw in my dream, that as they went on, Faithful,



<P>as he chanced to look on one side, saw a man whose name is Talkative,



<P>walking at a distance beside them; for in this place



<P>there was room enough for them all to walk.&nbsp; He was a tall man,



<P>and something more comely at a distance than at hand.



<P>To this man Faithful addressed himself in this manner:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Friend, whither away?&nbsp; Are you going to the heavenly

country?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TALK.&nbsp; I am going to the same place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; That is well; then I hope we may have your good company.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TALK.&nbsp; With a very good will will I be your companion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{186}



<P>&lt;Faithful and Talkative enter discourse>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Come on, then, and let us go together, and let us spend

our time



<P>in discoursing of things that are profitable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Talkative's dislike of bad discourse>



<P>TALK.&nbsp; To talk of things that are good, to me is very acceptable,



<P>with you or with any other; and I am glad that I have met with



<P>those that incline to so good a work; for, to speak the truth,



<P>there are but few that care thus to spend their time,



<P>(as they are in their travels), but choose much rather to be



<P>speaking of things to no profit; and this hath been a trouble for me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; That is indeed a thing to be lamented; for what things



<P>so worthy of the use of the tongue and mouth of men on earth



<P>as are the things of the God of heaven?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TALK.&nbsp; I like you wonderful well, for your sayings are full



<P>of conviction; and I will add, what thing is so pleasant,



<P>and what so profitable, as to talk of the things of God?



<P>What things so pleasant (that is, if a man hath any delight in things



<P>that are wonderful)?&nbsp; For instance, if a man doth delight to talk



<P>of the history or the mystery of things; or if a man doth love to talk



<P>of miracles, wonders, or signs, where shall he find things recorded



<P>so delightful, and so sweetly penned, as in the Holy Scripture?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{187}



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; That is true; but to be profited by such things in our

talk



<P>should be that which we design.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Talkative's fine discourse>



<P>TALK.&nbsp; That is it that I said; for to talk of such things



<P>is most profitable; for by so doing, a man may get knowledge



<P>of many things; as of the vanity of earthly things, and the benefit



<P>of things above.&nbsp; Thus, in general, but more particularly by this,



<P>a man may learn the necessity of the new birth, the insufficiency



<P>of our works, the need of Christ's righteousness, &amp;c.&nbsp; Besides,



<P>by this a man may learn, by talk, what it is to repent, to believe,



<P>to pray, to suffer, or the like; by this also a man may learn



<P>what are the great promises and consolations of the gospel,



<P>to his own comfort.&nbsp; Further, by this a man may learn



<P>to refute false opinions, to vindicate the truth, and also



<P>to instruct the ignorant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; All this is true, and glad am I to hear these things from

you.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TALK.&nbsp; Alas! the want of this is the cause why so few understand



<P>the need of faith, and the necessity of a work of grace in their soul,



<P>in order to eternal life; but ignorantly live in the works of the law,



<P>by which a man can by no means obtain the kingdom of heaven.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{188}



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; But, by your leave, heavenly knowledge of these



<P>is the gift of God; no man attaineth to them by human industry,



<P>or only by the talk of them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;O brave Talkative>



<P>TALK.&nbsp; All this I know very well; for a man can receive nothing,



<P>except it be given him from Heaven; all is of grace, not of works.



<P>I could give you a hundred scriptures for the confirmation of this.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Well, then, said Faithful, what is that one thing that



<P>we shall at this time found our discourse upon?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;O brave Talkative>



<P>TALK.&nbsp; What you will.&nbsp; I will talk of things heavenly,



<P>or things earthly; things moral, or things evangelical; things sacred,



<P>or things profane; things past, or things to come; things foreign,



<P>or things at home; things more essential, or things circumstantial;



<P>provided that all be done to our profit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{189}



<P>&lt;Faithful beguiled by Talkative>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Now did Faithful begin to wonder; and stepping to Christian,



<P>(for he walked all this while by himself), he said to him, (but softly),



<P>What a brave companion have we got!&nbsp; Surely this man will make



<P>a very excellent pilgrim.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; At this Christian modestly smiled, and said, This man,



<P>with whom you are so taken, will beguile, with that tongue of his,



<P>twenty of them that know him not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Do you know him, then?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{190}



<P>&lt;Christian makes a discovery of Talkative, telling Faithful who he

was>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Know him!&nbsp; Yes, better than he knows himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Pray, what is he?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; His name is Talkative; he dwelleth in our town.



<P>I wonder that you should be a stranger to him, only I consider



<P>that our town is large.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Whose son is he?&nbsp; And whereabout does he dwell?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; He is the son of one Say-well; he dwelt in Prating Row;



<P>and is known of all that are acquainted with him, by the name of



<P>Talkative in Prating Row; and notwithstanding his fine tongue,



<P>he is but a sorry fellow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{191}



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Well, he seems to be a very pretty man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; That is, to them who have not thorough acquaintance with

him;



<P>for he is best abroad; near home, he is ugly enough.



<P>Your saying that he is a pretty man, brings to my mind



<P>what I have observed in the work of the painter, whose pictures



<P>show best at a distance, but, very near, more unpleasing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{192}



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; But I am ready to think you do but jest, because you smiled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; God forbid that I should jest (although I smiled) in this

matter,



<P>or that I should accuse any falsely!&nbsp; I will give you



<P>a further discovery of him.&nbsp; This man is for any company,



<P>and for any talk; as he talketh now with you, so will he talk



<P>when he is on the ale-bench; and the more drink he hath in his crown,



<P>the more of these things he hath in his mouth; religion hath no place



<P>in his heart, or house, or conversation; all he hath



<P>lieth in his tongue, and his religion is, to make a noise therewith.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{193}



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Say you so! then am I in this man greatly deceived.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Talkative talks, but does not>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Deceived! you may be sure of it; remember the proverb,



<P>"They say and do not."&nbsp; [Matt. 23:3]&nbsp; But the kingdom of God



<P>is not in word, but in Power.&nbsp; [1 Cor 4:20]&nbsp; He talketh of

prayer,



<P>of repentance, of faith, and of the new birth; but he knows but only



<P>to talk of them.&nbsp; I have been in his family, and have observed

him



<P>both at home and abroad; and I know what I say of him is the truth.



<P>&lt;His house is empty of religion>&nbsp; His house is as empty of religion



<P>as the white of an egg is of savour.&nbsp; There is there neither prayer



<P>nor sign of repentance for sin; yea, the brute in his kind serves God



<P>far better than he.&nbsp; &lt;He is a stain to religion>&nbsp; He is

the very stain,



<P>reproach, and shame of religion, to all that know him; it can hardly



<P>have a good word in all that end of the town where he dwells,



<P>through him.&nbsp; [Rom. 2:24,25]&nbsp; &lt;The Proverb that goes of

him>



<P>Thus say the common people that know him, A saint abroad,



<P>and a devil at home.&nbsp; His poor family finds it so; he is such a

churl,



<P>such a railer at and so unreasonable with his servants,



<P>that they neither know how to do for or speak to him.



<P>&lt;Men shun to deal with him>&nbsp; Men that have any dealings with

him say



<P>it is better to deal with a Turk than with him; for fairer dealing



<P>they shall have at their hands.&nbsp; This Talkative (if it be possible)



<P>will go beyond them, defraud, beguile, and overreach them.&nbsp; Besides,



<P>he brings up his sons to follow his steps; and if he findeth



<P>in any of them a foolish timorousness, (for so he calls



<P>the first appearance of a tender conscience,) he calls them



<P>fools and blockheads, and by no means will employ them in much,



<P>or speak to their commendations before others.&nbsp; For my part,



<P>I am of opinion, that he has, by his wicked life, caused many



<P>to stumble and fall; and will be, if God prevent not,



<P>the ruin of many more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{194}



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Well, my brother, I am bound to believe you; not only because



<P>you say you know him, but also because, like a Christian,



<P>you make your reports of men.&nbsp; For I cannot think that you



<P>speak these things of ill-will, but because it is even so as you say.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Had I known him no more than you, I might perhaps



<P>have thought of him, as, at the first, you did; yea, had he received



<P>this report at their hands only that are enemies to religion,



<P>I should have thought it had been a slander,--a lot that often falls



<P>from bad men's mouths upon good men's names and professions;



<P>but all these things, yea, and a great many more as bad,



<P>of my own knowledge, I can prove him guilty of.&nbsp; Besides,



<P>good men are ashamed of him; they can neither call him brother,



<P>nor friend; the very naming of him among them makes them blush,



<P>if they know him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{195}



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Well, I see that saying and doing are two things,



<P>and hereafter I shall better observe this distinction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;The carcass of religion>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; They are two things, indeed, and are as diverse as are



<P>the soul and the body; for as the body without the soul is but



<P>a dead carcass, so saying, if it be alone, is but a dead carcass also.



<P>The soul of religion is the practical part:&nbsp; "Pure religion



<P>and undefiled, before God and the Father, is this, To visit



<P>the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself



<P>unspotted from the world."&nbsp; [James 1:27; see vv. 22-26]



<P>This Talkative is not aware of; he thinks that hearing and saying



<P>will make a good Christian, and thus he deceiveth his own soul.



<P>Hearing is but as the sowing of the seed; talking is not sufficient



<P>to prove that fruit is indeed in the heart and life; and let us



<P>assure ourselves, that at the day of doom men shall be judged



<P>according to their fruits.&nbsp; [Matt. 13, 25]&nbsp; It will not be

said then,



<P>Did you believe? but, Were you doers, or talkers only?



<P>and accordingly shall they be judged.&nbsp; The end of the world



<P>is compared to our harvest; and you know men at harvest



<P>regard nothing but fruit.&nbsp; Not that anything can be accepted



<P>that is not of faith, but I speak this to show you how insignificant



<P>the profession of Talkative will be at that day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{196}



<P>&lt;Faithful convinced of the badness of Talkative>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; This brings to my mind that of Moses, by which he describeth



<P>the beast that is clean.&nbsp; [Lev. 11:3-7; Deut. 14:6-8]&nbsp; He

is such a one



<P>that parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud; not that parteth



<P>the hoof only, or that cheweth the cud only.&nbsp; The hare cheweth

the cud,



<P>but yet is unclean, because he parteth not the hoof.



<P>And this truly resembleth Talkative; he cheweth the cud,



<P>he seeketh knowledge, he cheweth upon the word; but he divideth not



<P>the hoof, he parteth not with the way of sinners; but, as the hare,



<P>he retaineth the foot of a dog or bear, and therefore he is unclean.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Talkative like to things that sound without life>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; You have spoken, for aught I know, the true gospel sense



<P>of those texts.&nbsp; And I will add another thing:&nbsp; Paul calleth

some men,



<P>yea, and those great talkers, too, sounding brass and tinkling cymbals;



<P>that is, as he expounds them in another place, things without life,



<P>giving sound.&nbsp; [1 Cor. 13:1-3; 14:7]&nbsp; Things without life,

that is,



<P>without the true faith and grace of the gospel; and consequently,



<P>things that shall never be placed in the kingdom of heaven



<P>among those that are the children of life; though their sound,



<P>by their talk, be as if it were the tongue or voice of an angel.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Well, I was not so fond of his company at first,



<P>but I am as sick of it now.&nbsp; What shall we do to be rid of him?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Take my advice, and do as I bid you, and you shall find



<P>that he will soon be sick of your company too, except God



<P>shall touch his heart, and turn it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; What would you have me to do?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, go to him, and enter into some serious discourse



<P>about the power of religion; and ask him plainly



<P>(when he has approved of it, for that he will) whether this thing



<P>be set up in his heart, house, or conversation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{197}



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Then Faithful stepped forward again, and said to Talkative,



<P>Come, what cheer?&nbsp; How is it now?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TALK.&nbsp; Thank you, well.&nbsp; I thought we should have had



<P>a great deal of talk by this time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{198}



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Well, if you will, we will fall to it now; and since



<P>you left it with me to state the question, let it be this:



<P>How doth the saving grace of God discover itself when it is in



<P>the heart of man?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Talkative's false discovery of a work of grace>



<P>TALK.&nbsp; I perceive, then, that our talk must be about the power



<P>of things.&nbsp; Well, it is a very good question, and I shall be willing



<P>to answer you.&nbsp; And take my answer in brief, thus:&nbsp; First,



<P>Where the grace of God is in the heart, it causeth there



<P>a great outcry against sin.&nbsp; Secondly ----

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Nay, hold, let us consider of one at once.&nbsp; I think

you should



<P>rather say, It shows itself by inclining the soul to abhor its sin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TALK.&nbsp; Why, what difference is there between crying out against,



<P>and abhorring of sin?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{199}



<P>&lt;To cry out against sin, no sign of grace>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Oh, a great deal.&nbsp; A man may cry out against sin of

policy,



<P>but he cannot abhor it, but by virtue of a godly antipathy against it.



<P>I have heard many cry out against sin in the pulpit,



<P>who yet can abide it well enough in the heart, house, and conversation.



<P>Joseph's mistress cried out with a loud voice, as if she had been



<P>very holy; but she would willingly, notwithstanding that,



<P>have committed uncleanness with him.&nbsp; Some cry out against sin



<P>even as the mother cries out against her child in her lap,



<P>when she calleth it slut and naughty girl, and then falls



<P>to hugging and kissing it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TALK.&nbsp; You lie at the catch, I perceive.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{200}



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; No, not I; I am only for setting things right.



<P>But what is the second thing whereby you would prove a discovery



<P>of a work of grace in the heart?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TALK.&nbsp; Great knowledge of gospel mysteries.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Great knowledge no sign of grace>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; This sign should have been first; but first or last,



<P>it is also false; for knowledge, great knowledge, may be obtained



<P>in the mysteries of the gospel, and yet no work of grace in the soul.



<P>[1 Cor. 13]&nbsp; Yea, if a man have all knowledge, he may yet be nothing,



<P>and so consequently be no child of God.&nbsp; When Christ said,



<P>"Do you know all these things?" and the disciples had answered, Yes;



<P>he addeth, "Blessed are ye if ye do them."&nbsp; He doth not lay the

blessing



<P>in the knowing of them, but in the doing of them.&nbsp; For there is



<P>a knowledge that is not attended with doing:&nbsp; He that knoweth



<P>his masters will, and doeth it not.&nbsp; A man may know like an angel,



<P>and yet be no Christian, therefore your sign of it is not true.



<P>Indeed, to know is a thing that pleaseth talkers and boasters,



<P>but to do is that which pleaseth God.&nbsp; Not that the heart can be

good



<P>without knowledge; for without that, the heart is naught.



<P>&lt;Knowledge and knowledge>&nbsp; There is, therefore, knowledge and

knowledge.



<P>Knowledge that resteth in the bare speculation of things;



<P>and knowledge that is accompanied with the grace of faith and love;



<P>which puts a man upon doing even the will of God from the heart:



<P>the first of these will serve the talker; but without the other



<P>the true Christian is not content.&nbsp; &lt;True knowledge attended



<P>with endeavors>&nbsp; "Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law;



<P>yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart."&nbsp; [Ps. 119:34]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TALK.&nbsp; You lie at the catch again; this is not for edification.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Well, if you please, propound another sign how



<P>this work of grace discovereth itself where it is.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TALK.&nbsp; Not I, for I see we shall not agree.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Well, if you will not, will you give me leave to do it?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TALK.&nbsp; You may use your liberty.

<P>But I replied, Lord, I am a great, a very great sinner.



<P>And he answered, "My grace is sufficient for thee."&nbsp; [2 Cor.12:9]



<P>Then I said, But, Lord, what is believing?&nbsp; And then I saw



<P>from that saying, "He that cometh to me shall never hunger,



<P>and he that believeth on me shall never thirst", that believing



<P>and coming was all one; and that he that came, that is,



<P>ran out in his heart and affections after salvation by Christ,



<P>he indeed believed in Christ.&nbsp; [John 6:35]&nbsp; Then the water



<P>stood in mine eyes, and I asked further.&nbsp; But, Lord,



<P>may such a great sinner as I am be indeed accepted of thee,



<P>and be saved by thee?&nbsp; And I heard him say, "And him that cometh

to me,



<P>I will in no wise cast out."&nbsp; [John 6:37]&nbsp; Then I said, But

how, Lord,



<P>must I consider of thee in my coming to thee, that my faith may be



<P>placed aright upon thee?&nbsp; Then he said, "Christ Jesus came



<P>into the world to save sinners."&nbsp; [1 Tim. 1:15]&nbsp; "He is the

end



<P>of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."&nbsp; [Rom.

10:4]



<P>"He died for our sins, and rose again for our justification."



<P>[Rom. 4:25]&nbsp; "He loved us, and washed us from our sins



<P>in his own blood."&nbsp; [Rev. 1:5]&nbsp; "He is mediator betwixt God

and us."



<P>[1 Tim. 2:5]&nbsp; "He ever liveth to make intercession for us."



<P>[Heb. 7:24,25]&nbsp; From all which I gathered, that I must



<P>look for righteousness in his person, and for satisfaction for my sins



<P>by his blood; that what he did in obedience to his Father's law,



<P>and in submitting to the penalty thereof, was not for himself,



<P>but for him that will accept it for his salvation, and be thankful.



<P>And now was my heart full of joy, mine eyes full of tears,



<P>and mine affections running over with love to the name, people,



<P>and ways of Jesus Christ.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{352}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; This was a revelation of Christ to your soul indeed;



<P>but tell me particularly what effect this had upon your spirit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; It made me see that all the world, notwithstanding all



<P>the righteousness thereof, is in a state of condemnation.



<P>It made me see that God the Father, though he be just,



<P>can justly justify the coming sinner.&nbsp; It made me greatly ashamed



<P>of the vileness of my former life, and confounded me with the sense



<P>of mine own ignorance; for there never came thought into my heart



<P>before now that showed me so the beauty of Jesus Christ.



<P>It made me love a holy life, and long to do something for



<P>the honour and glory of the name of the Lord Jesus; yea,



<P>I thought that had I now a thousand gallons of blood in my body,



<P>I could spill it all for the sake of the Lord Jesus.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{353}



<P>I saw then in my dream that Hopeful looked back and saw Ignorance,



<P>whom they had left behind, coming after.&nbsp; Look, said he to Christian,



<P>how far yonder youngster loitereth behind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Ay, ay, I see him; he careth not for our company.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; But I trow it would not have hurt him had he



<P>kept pace with us hitherto.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; That is true; but I warrant you he thinketh otherwise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; That, I think, he doth; but, however, let us tarry for him.



<P>So they did.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{354}



<P>&lt;Young Ignorance comes up again; their talk>



<P>Then Christian said to him, Come away, man, why do you stay so behind?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; I take my pleasure in walking alone, even more a great

deal



<P>than in company, unless I like it the better.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Christian to Hopeful, (but softly), Did I not tell you



<P>he cared not for our company?&nbsp; But, however, said he, come up,



<P>and let us talk away the time in this solitary place.



<P>Then directing his speech to Ignorance, he said, Come, how do you?



<P>How stands it between God and your soul now?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{355}



<P>&lt;Ignorance's hope, and the ground of it>



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; I hope well; for I am always full of good motions,



<P>that come into my mind, to comfort me as I walk.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; What good motions? pray, tell us.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; Why, I think of God and heaven.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; So do the devils and damned souls.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; But I think of them and desire them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; So do many that are never like to come there.



<P>"The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing."&nbsp; [Prov.

13:4]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; But I think of them, and leave all for them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; That I doubt; for leaving all is a hard matter:&nbsp; yea,



<P>a harder matter than many are aware of.&nbsp; But why, or by what,



<P>art thou persuaded that thou hast left all for God and heaven.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{356}



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; My heart tells me so.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; The wise man says, "He that trusts his own heart is a fool."



<P>[Prov. 28:26]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; This is spoken of an evil heart, but mine is a good one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But how dost thou prove that?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; It comforts me in hopes of heaven.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; That may be through its deceitfulness; for a man's heart



<P>may minister comfort to him in the hopes of that thing for which



<P>he yet has no ground to hope.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; But my heart and life agree together, and therefore



<P>my hope is well grounded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Who told thee that thy heart and life agree together?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; My heart tells me so.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Ask my fellow if I be a thief! Thy heart tells thee so!



<P>Except the Word of God beareth witness in this matter,



<P>other testimony is of no value.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{357}



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; But is it not a good heart that hath good thoughts?



<P>and is not that a good life that is according to God's commandments?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, that is a good heart that hath good thoughts,



<P>and that is a good life that is according to God's commandments;



<P>but it is one thing, indeed, to have these, and another thing



<P>only to think so.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; Pray, what count you good thoughts, and a life according



<P>to God's commandments?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; There are good thoughts of divers kinds; some respecting



<P>ourselves, some God, some Christ, and some other things.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;What are good thoughts>



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; What be good thoughts respecting ourselves?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Such as agree with the Word of God.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{358}



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; When do our thoughts of ourselves agree with the Word of

God?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; When we pass the same judgment upon ourselves



<P>which the Word passes.&nbsp; To explain myself--the Word of God



<P>saith of persons in a natural condition, "There is none righteous,



<P>there is none that doeth good."&nbsp; [Rom. 3]&nbsp; It saith also,



<P>that "every imagination of the heart of man is only evil,



<P>and that continually."&nbsp; [Gen. 6:5]&nbsp; And again, "The imagination



<P>of man's heart is evil from his youth."&nbsp; [Rom. 8:21]&nbsp; Now

then,



<P>when we think thus of ourselves, having sense thereof,



<P>then are our thoughts good ones, because according to the Word of God.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; I will never believe that my heart is thus bad.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Therefore thou never hadst one good thought concerning thyself



<P>in thy life.&nbsp; But let me go on.&nbsp; As the Word passeth a judgment



<P>upon our heart, so it passeth a judgment upon our ways; and when



<P>OUR thoughts of our hearts and ways agree with the judgment which



<P>the Word giveth of both, then are both good, because agreeing thereto.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{359}



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; Make out your meaning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, the Word of God saith that man's ways are crooked ways;



<P>not good, but perverse.&nbsp; [Ps. 125:5, Prov. 2:15]&nbsp; It saith



<P>they are naturally out of the good way, that they have not known it.



<P>[Rom. 3]&nbsp; Now, when a man thus thinketh of his ways,--I say,



<P>when he doth sensibly, and with heart-humiliation, thus think,



<P>then hath he good thoughts of his own ways, because his thoughts



<P>now agree with the judgment of the Word of God.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{360}



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; What are good thoughts concerning God?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Even as I have said concerning ourselves, when our thoughts

of God



<P>do agree with what the Word saith of him; and that is,



<P>when we think of his being and attributes as the Word hath taught,



<P>of which I cannot now discourse at large; but to speak of him



<P>with reference to us:&nbsp; Then we have right thoughts of God,



<P>when we think that he knows us better than we know ourselves,



<P>and can see sin in us when and where we can see none in ourselves;



<P>when we think he knows our inmost thoughts, and that our heart,



<P>with all its depths, is always open unto his eyes; also,



<P>when we think that all our righteousness stinks in his nostrils,



<P>and that, therefore, he cannot abide to see us stand before him



<P>in any confidence, even in all our best performances.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{361}



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; Do you think that I am such a fool as to think God can

see



<P>no further than I? or, that I would come to God in the best



<P>of my performances?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, how dost thou think in this matter?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; Why, to be short, I think I must believe in Christ



<P>for justification.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; How! think thou must believe in Christ, when thou seest not

thy



<P>need of him!&nbsp; Thou neither seest thy original nor actual infirmities;



<P>but hast such an opinion of thyself, and of what thou dost,



<P>as plainly renders thee to be one that did never see a necessity



<P>of Christ's personal righteousness to justify thee before God.



<P>How, then, dost thou say, I believe in Christ?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{362}



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; I believe well enough for all that.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; How dost thou believe?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;The faith of Ignorance>



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; I believe that Christ died for sinners, and that I shall

be



<P>justified before God from the curse, through his gracious acceptance



<P>of my obedience to his law.&nbsp; Or thus, Christ makes my duties,



<P>that are religious, acceptable to his Father, by virtue of his merits;



<P>and so shall I be justified.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{363}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Let me give an answer to this confession of thy faith:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1.&nbsp; Thou believest with a fantastical faith; for this faith is

nowhere



<P>described in the Word.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2.&nbsp; Thou believest with a false faith; because it taketh justification



<P>from the personal righteousness of Christ, and applies it to thy own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3.&nbsp; This faith maketh not Christ a justifier of thy person,



<P>but of thy actions; and of thy person for thy actions' sake,



<P>which is false.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>4.&nbsp; Therefore, this faith is deceitful, even such as will leave

thee



<P>under wrath, in the day of God Almighty; for true justifying faith



<P>puts the soul, as sensible of its condition by the law, upon flying



<P>for refuge unto Christ's righteousness, which righteousness of his



<P>is not an act of grace, by which he maketh for justification,



<P>thy obedience accepted with God; but his personal obedience to the law,



<P>in doing and suffering for us what that required at our hands;



<P>this righteousness, I say, true faith accepteth; under the skirt



<P>of which, the soul being shrouded, and by it presented



<P>as spotless before God, it is accepted, and acquit from condemnation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{364}



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; What! would you have us trust to what Christ, in his own

person,



<P>has done without us?&nbsp; This conceit would loosen the reins of our

lust,



<P>and tolerate us to live as we list; for what matter how we live,



<P>if we may be justified by Christ's personal righteousness from all,



<P>when we believe it?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Ignorance is thy name, and as thy name is, so art thou;



<P>even this thy answer demonstrateth what I say.&nbsp; Ignorant thou art



<P>of what justifying righteousness is, and as ignorant how to secure



<P>thy soul, through the faith of it, from the heavy wrath of God.



<P>Yea, thou also art ignorant of the true effects of saving faith



<P>in this righteousness of Christ, which is, to bow and win over



<P>the heart to God in Christ, to love his name, his word, ways,



<P>and people, and not as thou ignorantly imaginest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Ask him if ever he had Christ revealed to him from heaven.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{365}



<P>&lt;Ignorance jangles with them>



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; What! you are a man for revelations!&nbsp; I believe that

what



<P>both you, and all the rest of you, say about that matter,



<P>is but the fruit of distracted brains.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Why, man! Christ is so hid in God from the natural apprehensions



<P>of the flesh, that he cannot by any man be savingly known,



<P>unless God the Father reveals him to them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{366}



<P>&lt;He speaks reproachfully of what he knows not>



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; That is your faith, but not mine; yet mine, I doubt not,



<P>is as good as yours, though I have not in my head so many whimsies



<P>as you.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Give me leave to put in a word.&nbsp; You ought not so slightly



<P>to speak of this matter; for this I will boldly affirm,



<P>even as my good companion hath done, that no man can know Jesus Christ



<P>but by the revelation of the Father; [Matt. 11:27] yea, and faith too,



<P>by which the soul layeth hold upon Christ, if it be right,



<P>must be wrought by the exceeding greatness of his mighty power;



<P>the working of which faith, I perceive, poor Ignorance,



<P>thou art ignorant of.&nbsp; [1 Cor. 12:3, Eph. 1:18,19]&nbsp; Be awakened,

then,



<P>see thine own wretchedness, and fly to the Lord Jesus;



<P>and by his righteousness, which is the righteousness of God,



<P>for he himself is God, thou shalt be delivered from condemnation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{367}



<P>&lt;The talk broke up>



<P>IGNOR.&nbsp; You go so fast, I cannot keep pace with you.



<P>Do you go on before; I must stay a while behind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then they said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, Ignorance, wilt thou yet foolish be,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To slight good counsel, ten times given thee?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if thou yet refuse it, thou shalt know,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere long, the evil of thy doing so.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember, man, in time, stoop, do not fear;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good counsel taken well, saves:&nbsp; therefore

hear.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if thou yet shalt slight it, thou wilt

be



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The loser, (Ignorance), I'll warrant thee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then Christian addressed thus himself to his fellow:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, come, my good Hopeful, I perceive that thou and I



<P>must walk by ourselves again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{368}



<P>So I saw in my dream that they went on apace before,



<P>and Ignorance he came hobbling after.&nbsp; Then said Christian



<P>to his companion, It pities me much for this poor man,



<P>it will certainly go ill with him at last.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Alas! there are abundance in our town in his condition,



<P>whole families, yea, whole streets, and that of pilgrims too;



<P>and if there be so many in our parts, how many, think you,



<P>must there be in the place where he was born?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Indeed the Word saith, "He hath blinded their eyes,



<P>lest they should see", &amp;c.&nbsp; But now we are by ourselves,



<P>what do you think of such men?&nbsp; Have they at no time, think you,



<P>convictions of sin, and so consequently fears that their state



<P>is dangerous?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Nay, do you answer that question yourself, for you are



<P>the elder man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then I say, sometimes (as I think) they may; but they being



<P>naturally ignorant, understand not that such convictions tend



<P>to their good; and therefore they do desperately seek to stifle them,



<P>and presumptuously continue to flatter themselves in the way of



<P>their own hearts.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{369}



<P>&lt;The good use of fear>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I do believe, as you say, that fear tends much to men's

good,



<P>and to make them right, at their beginning to go on pilgrimage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Without all doubt it doth, if it be right; for so says the

Word,



<P>"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."



<P>[Prov. 1:7, 9:10, Job 28:28, Ps. 111:10]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{370}



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; How will you describe right fear?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Right fear>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; True or right fear is discovered by three things:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1.&nbsp; By its rise; it is caused by saving convictions for sin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2.&nbsp; It driveth the soul to lay fast hold of Christ for salvation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3.&nbsp; It begetteth and continueth in the soul a great reverence of

God,



<P>his Word, and ways, keeping it tender, and making it afraid



<P>to turn from them, to the right hand or to the left,



<P>to anything that may dishonour God, break its peace, grieve the Spirit,



<P>or cause the enemy to speak reproachfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Well said; I believe you have said the truth.



<P>Are we now almost got past the Enchanted Ground?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, art thou weary of this discourse?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; No, verily, but that I would know where we are.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{371}



<P>&lt;Why ignorant persons stifle convictions>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; We have not now above two miles further to go thereon.



<P>But let us return to our matter.&nbsp; &lt;In general>&nbsp; Now the

ignorant



<P>know not that such convictions as tend to put them in fear



<P>are for their good, and therefore they seek to stifle them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; How do they seek to stifle them?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{372}



<P>&lt;In particular>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; They think that those fears are wrought by the devil,



<P>(though indeed they are wrought of God); and, thinking so,



<P>they resist them as things that directly tend to their overthrow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2.&nbsp; They also think that these fears tend to the spoiling



<P>of their faith, when, alas, for them, poor men that they are,



<P>they have none at all! and therefore they harden their hearts



<P>against them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3.&nbsp; They presume they ought not to fear; and, therefore,



<P>in despite of them, wax presumptuously confident.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>4.&nbsp; They see that those fears tend to take away from them



<P>their pitiful old self-holiness, and therefore they resist them



<P>with all their might.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{373}



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I know something of this myself; for, before I knew myself,



<P>it was so with me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, we will leave, at this time, our neighbour Ignorance



<P>by himself, and fall upon another profitable question.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; With all my heart, but you shall still begin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Talk about one Temporary>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well then, did you not know, about ten years ago,



<P>one Temporary in your parts, who was a forward man in religion then?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Where he dwelt>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Know him! yes, he dwelt in Graceless, a town about two miles



<P>off of Honesty, and he dwelt next door to one Turnback.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{374}



<P>&lt;He was towardly once>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Right, he dwelt under the same roof with him.&nbsp; Well,



<P>that man was much awakened once; I believe that then he had



<P>some sight of his sins, and of the wages that were due thereto.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; I am of your mind, for, my house not being above three miles



<P>from him, he would ofttimes come to me, and that with many tears.



<P>Truly I pitied the man, and was not altogether without hope of him;



<P>but one may see, it is not every one that cries, Lord, Lord.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; He told me once that he was resolved to go on pilgrimage,



<P>as we do now; but all of a sudden he grew acquainted with one Save-self,



<P>and then he became a stranger to me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{375}



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Now, since we are talking about him, let us a little inquire



<P>into the reason of the sudden backsliding of him and such others.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; It may be very profitable, but do you begin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Reasons why towardly ones go back>



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Well, then, there are in my judgment four reasons for it:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{376}



<P>1.&nbsp; Though the consciences of such men are awakened, yet their

minds



<P>are not changed; therefore, when the power of guilt weareth away,



<P>that which provoked them to be religious ceaseth, wherefore they



<P>naturally turn to their own course again, even as we see the dog



<P>that is sick of what he has eaten, so long as his sickness prevails



<P>he vomits and casts up all; not that he doth this of a free mind



<P>(if we may say a dog has a mind), but because it troubleth his stomach;



<P>but now, when his sickness is over, and so his stomach eased,



<P>his desire being not at all alienate from his vomit, he turns him about



<P>and licks up all, and so it is true which is written, "The dog is turned



<P>to his own vomit again."&nbsp; [2 Pet. 2:22]&nbsp; Thus I say,



<P>being hot for heaven, by virtue only of the sense and fear



<P>of the torments of hell, as their sense of hell and the fears



<P>of damnation chills and cools, so their desires for heaven and salvation



<P>cool also.&nbsp; So then it comes to pass, that when their guilt and

fear



<P>is gone, their desires for heaven and happiness die, and they return



<P>to their course again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{377}



<P>2.&nbsp; Another reason is, they have slavish fears that do overmaster

them;



<P>I speak now of the fears that they have of men, for "the fear of man



<P>bringeth a snare".&nbsp; [Prov. 29:25]&nbsp; So then, though they seem

to be



<P>hot for heaven, so long as the flames of hell are about their ears,



<P>yet when that terror is a little over, they betake themselves



<P>to second thoughts; namely, that it is good to be wise, and not to run



<P>(for they know not what) the hazard of losing all, or, at least,



<P>of bringing themselves into unavoidable and unnecessary troubles,



<P>and so they fall in with the world again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{378}



<P>3. The shame that attends religion lies also as a block in their way;



<P>they are proud and haughty; and religion in their eye



<P>is low and contemptible, therefore, when they have lost their sense



<P>of hell and wrath to come, they return again to their former course.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{379}



<P>4. Guilt, and to meditate terror, are grievous to them.



<P>They like not to see their misery before they come into it;



<P>though perhaps the sight of it first, if they loved that sight,



<P>might make them fly whither the righteous fly and are safe.



<P>But because they do, as I hinted before, even shun the thoughts



<P>of guilt and terror, therefore, when once they are rid



<P>of their awakenings about the terrors and wrath of God,



<P>they harden their hearts gladly, and choose such ways as will



<P>harden them more and more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{380}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; You are pretty near the business, for the bottom of all



<P>is for want of a change in their mind and will.&nbsp; And therefore



<P>they are but like the felon that standeth before the judge,



<P>he quakes and trembles, and seems to repent most heartily,



<P>but the bottom of all is the fear of the halter; not that he hath



<P>any detestation of the offence, as is evident, because,



<P>let but this man have his liberty, and he will be a thief,



<P>and so a rogue still, whereas, if his mind was changed,



<P>he would be otherwise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{381}



<P>HOPE.&nbsp; Now I have showed you the reasons of their going back,



<P>do you show me the manner thereof.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; So I will willingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;How the apostate goes back>



<P>1.&nbsp; They draw off their thoughts, all that they may,



<P>from the remembrance of God, death, and judgment to come.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2.&nbsp; Then they cast off by degrees private duties, as closet prayer,



<P>curbing their lusts, watching, sorrow for sin, and the like.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>3.&nbsp; Then they shun the company of lively and warm Christians.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>4.&nbsp; After that they grow cold to public duty, as hearing, reading,



<P>godly conference, and the like.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>5.&nbsp; Then they begin to pick holes, as we say, in the coats



<P>of some of the godly; and that devilishly, that they may have



<P>a seeming colour to throw religion (for the sake of some infirmity



<P>they have espied in them) behind their backs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>6.&nbsp; Then they begin to adhere to, and associate themselves with,



<P>carnal, loose, and wanton men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>7.&nbsp; Then they give way to carnal and wanton discourses in secret;



<P>and glad are they if they can see such things in any



<P>that are counted honest, that they may the more boldly do it



<P>through their example.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>8.&nbsp; After this they begin to play with little sins openly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>9.&nbsp; And then, being hardened, they show themselves as they are.



<P>Thus, being launched again into the gulf of misery, unless a miracle



<P>of grace prevent it, they everlastingly perish in their own deceivings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{382}



<P>Now I saw in my dream, that by this time the Pilgrims were got over



<P>the Enchanted Ground, and entering into the country of Beulah, whose

air



<P>was very sweet and pleasant, the way lying directly through it,



<P>they solaced themselves there for a season.&nbsp; Yea, here they heard



<P>continually the singing of birds, and saw every day the flowers appear



<P>on the earth, and heard the voice of the turtle in the land.



<P>[Isa. 62:4, Song of Solomon 2:10-12]&nbsp; In this country



<P>the sun shineth night and day; wherefore this was beyond



<P>the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and also out of the reach



<P>of Giant Despair, neither could they from this place so much as see



<P>Doubting Castle.&nbsp; &lt;Angels>&nbsp; Here they were within sight

of the city



<P>they were going to, also here met them some of the inhabitants thereof;



<P>for in this land the Shining Ones commonly walked, because it was



<P>upon the borders of heaven.&nbsp; In this land also, the contract between



<P>the bride and the bridegroom was renewed; yea, here, "As the bridegroom



<P>rejoiceth over the bride, so did their God rejoice over them."



<P>[Isa. 62:5]&nbsp; Here they had no want of corn and wine; for in this

place



<P>they met with abundance of what they had sought for in all



<P>their pilgrimage.&nbsp; [Isa. 62:8]&nbsp; Here they heard voices from



<P>out of the city, loud voices, saying, "`Say ye to the daughter of Zion,



<P>Behold, thy salvation cometh!&nbsp; Behold, his reward is with him!'



<P>Here all the inhabitants of the country called them, `The holy people,



<P>The redeemed of the Lord, Sought out'", etc.&nbsp; [Isa. 62:11,12]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{383}



<P>Now as they walked in this land, they had more rejoicing than in parts



<P>more remote from the kingdom to which they were bound; and drawing near



<P>to the city, they had yet a more perfect view thereof.&nbsp; It was

builded



<P>of pearls and precious stones, also the street thereof was paved



<P>with gold; so that by reason of the natural glory of the city,



<P>and the reflection of the sunbeams upon it, Christian with desire



<P>fell sick; Hopeful also had a fit or two of the same disease.



<P>Wherefore, here they lay by it a while, crying out, because of



<P>their pangs, If ye find my beloved, tell him that I am sick of love.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{384}



<P>But, being a little strengthened, and better able to bear



<P>their sickness, they walked on their way, and came yet nearer



<P>and nearer, where were orchards, vineyards, and gardens,



<P>and their gates opened into the highway.&nbsp; Now, as they came up



<P>to these places, behold the gardener stood in the way,



<P>to whom the Pilgrims said, Whose goodly vineyards and gardens are these?



<P>He answered, They are the King's, and are planted here



<P>for his own delight, and also for the solace of pilgrims.



<P>So the gardener had them into the vineyards, and bid them



<P>refresh themselves with the dainties.&nbsp; [Deut. 23:24]



<P>He also showed them there the King's walks, and the arbours where



<P>he delighted to be; and here they tarried and slept.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{385}



<P>Now I beheld in my dream that they talked more in their sleep



<P>at this time than ever they did in all their journey;



<P>and being in a muse thereabout, the gardener said even to me,



<P>Wherefore musest thou at the matter?&nbsp; It is the nature of the fruit



<P>of the grapes of these vineyards to go down so sweetly



<P>as to cause the lips of them that are asleep to speak.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{386}



<P>So I saw that when they awoke, they addressed themselves to go up



<P>to the city; but, as I said, the reflection of the sun upon the city



<P>(for the city was pure gold) was so extremely glorious



<P>that they could not, as yet, with open face behold it, but through



<P>an instrument made for that purpose.&nbsp; So I saw, that as I went

on,



<P>there met them two men, in raiment that shone like gold;



<P>lso their faces shone as the light.&nbsp; [Rev. 21:18, 2 Cor. 3:18]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{387}



<P>These men asked the Pilgrims whence they came; and they told them.



<P>They also asked them where they had lodged, what difficulties



<P>and dangers, what comforts and pleasures they had met in the way;



<P>and they told them.&nbsp; Then said the men that met them, You have



<P>but two difficulties more to meet with, and then you are in the city.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{388}



<P>Christian then, and his companion, asked the men to go along with them;



<P>so they told them they would.&nbsp; But, said they, you must obtain

it



<P>by your own faith.&nbsp; So I saw in my dream that they went on together,



<P>until they came in sight of the gate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{389}



<P>&lt;Death>



<P>Now, I further saw, that betwixt them and the gate was a river,



<P>but there was no bridge to go over: the river was very deep.



<P>At the sight, therefore, of this river, the Pilgrims were much stunned;



<P>but the men that went in with them said, You must go through,



<P>or you cannot come at the gate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{390}



<P>&lt;Death is not welcome to nature, though by it we pass out of this

world



<P>into glory*>



<P>The Pilgrims then began to inquire if there was no other way



<P>to the gate; to which they answered, Yes; but there hath not any,



<P>save two, to wit, Enoch and Elijah, been permitted to tread that path



<P>since the foundation of the world, nor shall, until the last trumpet



<P>shall sound.&nbsp; [1 Cor. 15:51,52]&nbsp; The Pilgrims then,



<P>especially Christian, began to despond in their minds,



<P>and looked this way and that, but no way could be found by them



<P>by which they might escape the river.&nbsp; Then they asked the men



<P>if the waters were all of a depth.&nbsp; &lt;Angels help us not comfortably



<P>through death> They said:&nbsp; No; yet they could not help them



<P>in that case; for, said they, you shall find it deeper or shallower



<P>as you believe in the King of the place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>*In the Resurrection of the Righteous.&nbsp; [Rev. 20:4-6]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{391}



<P>They then addressed themselves to the water and, entering,



<P>Christian began to sink, and crying out to his good friend Hopeful,



<P>he said, I sink in deep waters; the billows go over my head,



<P>all his waves go over me! Selah.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{392}



<P>&lt;Christian's conflict at the hour of death>



<P>Then said the other, Be of good cheer, my brother, I feel the bottom,



<P>and it is good.&nbsp; Then said Christian, Ah! my friend,



<P>the sorrows of death hath compassed me about; I shall not see the land



<P>that flows with milk and honey; and with that a great darkness



<P>and horror fell upon Christian, so that he could not see before him.



<P>Also here he in great measure lost his senses, so that he could neither



<P>remember nor orderly talk of any of those sweet refreshments



<P>that he had met with in the way of his pilgrimage.&nbsp; But all the

words



<P>that he spake still tended to discover that he had horror of mind,



<P>and heart fears that he should die in that river, and never obtain



<P>entrance in at the gate.&nbsp; Here also, as they that stood by perceived,



<P>he was much in the troublesome thoughts of the sins that he



<P>had committed, both since and before he began to be a pilgrim.



<P>It was also observed that he was troubled with apparitions



<P>of hobgoblins and evil spirits, for ever and anon he would



<P>intimate so much by words.&nbsp; Hopeful, therefore, here had much ado



<P>to keep his brother's head above water; yea, sometimes he would be



<P>quite gone down, and then, ere a while, he would rise up again



<P>half dead.&nbsp; Hopeful also would endeavour to comfort him, saying,



<P>Brother, I see the gate, and men standing by to receive us:



<P>but Christian would answer, It is you, it is you they wait for;



<P>you have been Hopeful ever since I knew you.&nbsp; And so have you,



<P>said he to Christian.&nbsp; Ah! brother! said he, surely if I was right



<P>he would now arise to help me; but for my sins he hath brought me



<P>into the snare, and hath left me.&nbsp; Then said Hopeful, My brother,



<P>you have quite forgot the text, where it is said of the wicked,



<P>"There are no bands in their death, but their strength is firm.



<P>They are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued



<P>like other men.&nbsp; [Ps. 73:4,5]&nbsp; These troubles and distresses

that you



<P>go through in these waters are no sign that God hath forsaken you;



<P>but are sent to try you, whether you will call to mind that which



<P>heretofore you have received of his goodness, and live upon him



<P>in your distresses.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{393}



<P>&lt;Christian delivered from his fears in death>



<P>Then I saw in my dream, that Christian was as in a muse a while.



<P>To whom also Hopeful added this word, Be of good cheer,



<P>Jesus Christ maketh thee whole; and with that Christian brake out



<P>with a loud voice, Oh, I see him again! and he tells me,



<P>"When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee,



<P>and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee."&nbsp; [Isa. 43:2]



<P>Then they both took courage, and the enemy was after that as still



<P>as a stone, until they were gone over.&nbsp; Christian therefore



<P>presently found ground to stand upon, and so it followed that



<P>the rest of the river was but shallow.&nbsp; Thus they got over.



<P>&lt;The angels do wait for them, so soon as they are passed out



<P>of this world>&nbsp; Now, upon the bank of the river, on the other side,



<P>they saw the two shining men again, who there waited for them;



<P>wherefore, being come out of the river, they saluted them, saying,



<P>We are ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for those that



<P>shall be heirs of salvation.&nbsp; Thus they went along towards the

gate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{394}



<P>&lt;They have put off mortality>&nbsp; Now you must note that the city

stood



<P>upon a mighty hill, but the Pilgrims went up that hill with ease,



<P>because they had these two men to lead them up by the arms;



<P>also, they had left their mortal garments behind them in the river,



<P>for though they went in with them, they came out without them.



<P>They, therefore, went up here with much agility and speed,



<P>though the foundation upon which the city was framed was higher than



<P>the clouds.&nbsp; They therefore went up through the regions of the

air,



<P>sweetly talking as they went, being comforted, because they safely



<P>got over the river, and had such glorious companions to attend them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, now, look how the holy pilgrims ride,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clouds are their chariots, angels are their

guide:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who would not here for him all hazards run,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thus provides for his when this world's

done?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{395}



<P>The talk they had with the Shining Ones was about the glory



<P>of the place; who told them that the beauty and glory of it



<P>was inexpressible.&nbsp; There, said they, is the Mount Zion,



<P>the heavenly Jerusalem, the innumerable company of angels,



<P>and the spirits of just men made perfect.&nbsp; [Heb. 12:22-24]



<P>You are going now, said they, to the paradise of God, wherein you shall



<P>see the tree of life, and eat of the never-fading fruits thereof;



<P>and when you come there, you shall have white robes given you,



<P>and your walk and talk shall be every day with the King,



<P>even all the days of eternity.&nbsp; [Rev. 2:7, 3:4, 21:4,5]



<P>There you shall not see again such things as you saw when you were in



<P>the lower region upon the earth, to wit, sorrow, sickness, affliction,



<P>and death, for the former things are passed away.&nbsp; You are now

going



<P>to Abraham, to Isaac, and Jacob, and to the prophets--men that God



<P>hath taken away from the evil to come, and that are now resting



<P>upon their beds, each one walking in his righteousness.&nbsp; [Isa.

57:1,2,



<P>65:17]&nbsp; The men then asked, What must we do in the holy place?



<P>To whom it was answered, You must there receive the comforts



<P>of all your toil, and have joy for all your sorrow; you must reap



<P>what you have sown, even the fruit of all your prayers, and tears,



<P>and sufferings for the King by the way.&nbsp; [Gal. 6:7]&nbsp; In that

place



<P>you must wear crowns of gold, and enjoy the perpetual sight and vision



<P>of the Holy One, for there you shall see him as he is.&nbsp; [1 John

3:2]



<P>There also you shall serve him continually with praise, with shouting,



<P>and thanksgiving, whom you desired to serve in the world,



<P>though with much difficulty, because of the infirmity of your flesh.



<P>There your eyes shall be delighted with seeing, and your ears with



<P>hearing the pleasant voice of the Mighty One.&nbsp; There you shall



<P>enjoy your friends again that are gone thither before you;



<P>and there you shall with joy receive, even every one that follows



<P>into the holy place after you.&nbsp; There also shall you be clothed



<P>with glory and majesty, and put into an equipage fit to ride out



<P>with the King of Glory.&nbsp; When he shall come with sound of trumpet



<P>in the clouds, as upon the wings of the wind, you shall come with him;



<P>and when he shall sit upon the throne of judgment; you shall sit by

him;



<P>yea, and when he shall pass sentence upon all the workers of iniquity,



<P>let them be angels or men, you also shall have a voice in that judgment,



<P>because they were his and your enemies.&nbsp; [1 Thes. 4:13-16, Jude

1:14,



<P>Dan. 7:9,10, 1 Cor. 6:2,3]&nbsp; Also, when he shall again return to



<P>the city, you shall go too, with sound of trumpet, and be ever with

him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{396}



<P>Now while they were thus drawing towards the gate, behold a company



<P>of the heavenly host came out to meet them; to whom it was said,



<P>by the other two Shining Ones, These are the men that have



<P>loved our Lord when they were in the world, and that have left all



<P>for his holy name; and he hath sent us to fetch them, and we have



<P>brought them thus far on their desired journey, that they may go in



<P>and look their Redeemer in the face with joy.&nbsp; Then the heavenly

host



<P>gave a great shout, saying, "Blessed are they which are called unto



<P>the marriage supper of the Lamb."&nbsp; [Rev. 19:9]&nbsp; There came

out also



<P>at this time to meet them, several of the King's trumpeters,



<P>clothed in white and shining raiment, who, with melodious noises,



<P>and loud, made even the heavens to echo with their sound.



<P>These trumpeters saluted Christian and his fellow with ten thousand



<P>welcomes from the world; and this they did with shouting,



<P>and sound of trumpet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{397}



<P>This done, they compassed them round on every side; some went before,



<P>some behind, and some on the right hand, some on the left,



<P>(as it were to guard them through the upper regions),



<P>continually sounding as they went, with melodious noise,



<P>in notes on high:&nbsp; so that the very sight was, to them that could



<P>behold it, as if heaven itself was come down to meet them.&nbsp; Thus,



<P>therefore, they walked on together; and as they walked,



<P>ever and anon these trumpeters, even with joyful sound,



<P>would, by mixing their music with looks and gestures,



<P>still signify to Christian and his brother, how welcome they were



<P>into their company, and with what gladness they came to meet them;



<P>and now were these two men, as it were, in heaven, before they came



<P>at it, being swallowed up with the sight of angels, and with hearing



<P>of their melodious notes.&nbsp; Here also they had the city itself in

view,



<P>and they thought they heard all the bells therein to ring,



<P>to welcome them thereto.&nbsp; But above all, the warm and joyful thoughts



<P>that they had about their own dwelling there, with such company,



<P>and that for ever and ever.&nbsp; Oh, by what tongue or pen can



<P>their glorious joy be expressed!&nbsp; And thus they came up to the

gate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{398}



<P>Now, when they were come up to the gate, there was written over



<P>it in letters of gold, "Blessed are they that do his commandments,



<P>that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in



<P>through the gates into the city."&nbsp; [Rev. 22:14]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{399}



<P>Then I saw in my dream that the Shining Men bid them call at the gate;



<P>the which, when they did, some looked from above over the gate, to wit,



<P>Enoch, Moses, and Elijah, &amp;c., to whom it was said, These pilgrims



<P>are come from the City of Destruction, for the love that they bear



<P>to the King of this place; and then the Pilgrims gave in unto them



<P>each man his certificate, which they had received in the beginning;



<P>those, therefore, were carried in to the King, who, when he had



<P>read them, said, Where are the men?&nbsp; To whom it was answered,



<P>They are standing without the gate.&nbsp; The King then commanded



<P>to open the gate, "That the righteous nation," said he,



<P>"which keepeth the truth, may enter in."&nbsp; [Isa. 26:2]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{400}



<P>Now I saw in my dream that these two men went in at the gate: and lo,



<P>as they entered, they were transfigured, and they had raiment put on



<P>that shone like gold.&nbsp; There was also that met them with



<P>harps and crowns, and gave them to them--the harps to praise withal,



<P>and the crowns in token of honour.&nbsp; Then I heard in my dream



<P>that all the bells in the city rang again for joy, and that



<P>it was said unto them, "ENTER YE INTO THE JOY OF YOUR LORD."



<P>I also heard the men themselves, that they sang with a loud voice,



<P>saying, "BLESSING AND HONOUR, AND GLORY, AND POWER, BE UNTO HIM



<P>THAT SITTETH UPON THE THRONE, AND UNTO THE LAMB, FOR EVER AND EVER."



<P>[Rev. 5:13]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{401}



<P>Now, just as the gates were opened to let in the men,



<P>I looked in after them, and, behold, the City shone like the sun;



<P>the streets also were paved with gold, and in them walked many men,



<P>with crowns on their heads, palms in their hands, and golden harps



<P>to sing praises withal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{402}



<P>There were also of them that had wings, and they answered one another



<P>without intermission, saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord."



<P>[Rev. 4:8]&nbsp; And after that they shut up the gates; which,



<P>when I had seen, I wished myself among them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{403}



<P>&lt;Ignorance comes up to the river>



<P>Now while I was gazing upon all these things, I turned my head



<P>to look back, and saw Ignorance come up to the river side;



<P>but he soon got over, and that without half that difficulty which



<P>the other two men met with.&nbsp; &lt;Vain-hope does ferry him over>



<P>For it happened that there was then in that place, one Vain-hope,



<P>a ferryman, that with his boat helped him over; so he,



<P>as the other I saw, did ascend the hill, to come up to the gate,



<P>only he came alone; neither did any man meet him with



<P>the least encouragement.&nbsp; When he was come up to the gate,



<P>he looked up to the writing that was above, and then began to knock,



<P>supposing that entrance should have been quickly administered to him;



<P>but he was asked by the men that looked over the top of the gate,



<P>Whence came you, and what would you have?&nbsp; He answered,



<P>I have eat and drank in the presence of the King, and he has taught



<P>in our streets.&nbsp; Then they asked him for his certificate,



<P>that they might go in and show it to the King; so he fumbled



<P>in his bosom for one, and found none.&nbsp; Then said they, Have you

none?



<P>But the man answered never a word.&nbsp; So they told the King,



<P>but he would not come down to see him, but commanded



<P>the two Shining Ones that conducted Christian and Hopeful to the City,



<P>to go out and take Ignorance, and bind him hand and foot,



<P>and have him away.&nbsp; Then they took him up, and carried him



<P>through the air to the door that I saw in the side of the hill,



<P>and put him in there.&nbsp; Then I saw that there was a way to hell,



<P>even from the gates of heaven, as well as from the City of Destruction.



<P>So I awoke, and behold it was a dream.

<P>&lt;One good sign of grace>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; A work of grace in the soul discovereth itself,



<P>either to him that hath it, or to standers by.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To him that hath it thus:&nbsp; It gives him conviction of sin,



<P>especially of the defilement of his nature and the sin of unbelief,



<P>(for the sake of which he is sure to be damned, if he findeth not mercy



<P>at God's hand, by faith in Jesus Christ [John 16:8, Rom. 7:24,



<P>John 16:9, Mark 16:16]).&nbsp; This sight and sense of things worketh

in him



<P>sorrow and shame for sin; he findeth, moreover, revealed in him



<P>the Saviour of the world, and the absolute necessity of closing with

him



<P>for life, at the which he findeth hungerings and thirstings after him;



<P>to which hungerings, &amp;c., the promise is made.&nbsp; [Ps. 38:18,

Jer. 31:19,



<P>Gal. 2:16, Acts 4:12, Matt. 5:6, Rev. 21:6]&nbsp; Now, according to



<P>the strength or weakness of his faith in his Saviour,



<P>so is his joy and peace, so is his love to holiness, so are his desires



<P>to know him more, and also to serve him in this world.



<P>But though I say it discovereth itself thus unto him,



<P>yet it is but seldom that he is able to conclude that this



<P>is a work of grace; because his corruptions now, and his abused reason,



<P>make his mind to misjudge in this matter; therefore,



<P>in him that hath this work, there is required a very sound judgement



<P>before he can, with steadiness, conclude that this is a work of grace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{202}



<P>To others, it is thus discovered:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1.&nbsp; By an experimental confession of his faith in Christ.



<P>[Rom. 10:10, Phil. 1:27, Matt. 5:19]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>2.&nbsp; By a life answerable to that confession; to wit, a life of

holiness,



<P>heart-holiness, family-holiness, (if he hath a family),



<P>and by conversation-holiness in the world which, in the general,



<P>teacheth him, inwardly, to abhor his sin, and himself for that,



<P>in secret; to suppress it in his family and to promote holiness



<P>in the world; not by talk only, as a hypocrite or talkative person



<P>may do, but by a practical subjection, in faith and love,



<P>to the power of the Word.&nbsp; [John 14:15, Ps. 50:23, Job 42:5-6,



<P>Eze. 20:43]&nbsp; And now, Sir, as to this brief description



<P>of the work of grace, and also the discovery of it,



<P>if you have aught to object, object; if not, then give me leave



<P>to propound to you a second question.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{203}



<P>TALK.&nbsp; Nay, my part is not now to object, but to hear;



<P>let me, therefore, have your second question.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Another good sign of grace>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; It is this:&nbsp; Do you experience this first part



<P>of this description of it? and doth your life and conversation



<P>testify the same? or standeth your religion in word or in tongue,



<P>and not in deed and truth?&nbsp; Pray, if you incline to answer me in

this,



<P>say no more than you know the God above will say Amen to;



<P>and also nothing but what your conscience can justify you in;



<P>for not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom



<P>the Lord commendeth.&nbsp; Besides, to say I am thus and thus,



<P>when my conversation, and all my neighbours, tell me I lie,



<P>is great wickedness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Talkative not pleased with Faithful's question>



<P>{204}



<P>TALK.&nbsp; Then Talkative at first began to blush; but, recovering

himself,



<P>thus he replied:&nbsp; You come now to experience, to conscience, and

God;



<P>and to appeal to him for justification of what is spoken.



<P>This kind of discourse I did not expect; nor am I disposed



<P>to give an answer to such questions, because I count not myself



<P>bound thereto, unless you take upon you to be a catechiser, and,



<P>though you should so do, yet I may refuse to make you my judge.



<P>But, I pray, will you tell me why you ask me such questions?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{205}



<P>&lt;The reasons why Faithful put to him that question>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; Because I saw you forward to talk, and because I knew not



<P>that you had aught else but notion.&nbsp; Besides, to tell you all the

truth,



<P>I have heard of you, that you are a man whose religion lies in talk,



<P>and that your conversation gives this your mouth-profession the lie.



<P>&lt;Faithful's plain dealing with Talkative>&nbsp; They say, you are

a spot



<P>among Christians; and that religion fareth the worse



<P>for your ungodly conversation; that some have already stumbled at your



<P>wicked ways, and that more are in danger of being destroyed thereby;



<P>your religion, and an ale-house, and covetousness, and uncleanness,



<P>and swearing, and lying, and vain-company keeping, &amp;c.,



<P>will stand together.&nbsp; The proverb is true of you which is said



<P>of a whore, to wit, that she is a shame to all women;



<P>so are you a shame to all professors.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Talkative flings away from Faithful>



<P>TALK.&nbsp; Since you are ready to take up reports and to judge



<P>so rashly as you do, I cannot but conclude you are some



<P>peevish or melancholy man, not fit to be discoursed with; and so adieu.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{206}



<P>&lt;A good riddance>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then came up Christian, and said to his brother,



<P>I told you how it would happen:&nbsp; your words and his lusts



<P>could not agree; he had rather leave your company than reform his life.



<P>But he is gone, as I said; let him go, the loss is no man's but his

own;



<P>he has saved us the trouble of going from him; for he continuing



<P>(as I suppose he will do) as he is, he would have been but a blot in



<P>our company:&nbsp; besides, the apostle says, "From such withdraw thyself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; But I am glad we had this little discourse with him;



<P>it may happen that he will think of it again:&nbsp; however,



<P>I have dealt plainly with him, and so am clear of his blood,



<P>if he perisheth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{207}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; You did well to talk so plainly to him as you did;



<P>there is but little of this faithful dealing with men now-a-days,



<P>and that makes religion to stink so in the nostrils of many, as it doth;



<P>for they are these talkative fools whose religion is only in word,



<P>and are debauched and vain in their conversation, that



<P>(being so much admitted into the fellowship of the godly)



<P>do puzzle the world, blemish Christianity, and grieve the sincere.



<P>I wish that all men would deal with such as you have done:



<P>then should they either be made more conformable to religion,



<P>or the company of saints would be too hot for them.&nbsp; Then did



<P>Faithful say,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How Talkative at first lifts up his plumes!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How bravely doth he speak!&nbsp; How he presumes



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To drive down all before him!&nbsp; But so

soon



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Faithful talks of heart-work, like the moon



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's past the full, into the wane he goes.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so will all, but he that HEART-WORK knows.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{208}



<P>Thus they went on talking of what they had seen by the way,



<P>and so made that way easy which would otherwise, no doubt,



<P>have been tedious to them; for now they went through a wilderness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{209}



<P>&lt;Evangelist overtakes them again>



<P>Now, when they were got almost quite out of this wilderness,



<P>Faithful chanced to cast his eye back, and espied one coming after them,



<P>and he knew him.&nbsp; Oh! said Faithful to his brother, who comes yonder?



<P>Then Christian looked, and said, It is my good friend Evangelist.



<P>Ay, and my good friend too, said Faithful, for it was he that set me



<P>in the way to the gate.&nbsp; Now was Evangelist come up to them,



<P>and thus saluted them:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{210}



<P>EVAN.&nbsp; Peace be with you, dearly beloved; and peace be to your

helpers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;They are glad at the sight of him>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Welcome, welcome, my good Evangelist, the sight of thy countenance



<P>brings to my remembrance thy ancient kindness and unwearied labouring



<P>for my eternal good.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; And a thousand times welcome, said good Faithful.&nbsp;

Thy company,



<P>O sweet Evangelist, how desirable it is to us poor pilgrims!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>EVAN.&nbsp; Then said Evangelist, How hath it fared with you, my friends,



<P>since the time of our last parting?&nbsp; What have you met with,



<P>and how have you behaved yourselves?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{211}



<P>Then Christian and Faithful told him of all things that had happened



<P>to them in the way; and how, and with what difficulty,



<P>they had arrived at that place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{212}



<P>&lt;His exhortation to them>



<P>EVAN.&nbsp; Right glad am I, said Evangelist, not that you have met



<P>with trials, but that you have been victors; and for that you have,



<P>notwithstanding many weaknesses, continued in the way to this very day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I say, right glad am I of this thing, and that for mine own sake



<P>and yours.&nbsp; I have sowed, and you have reaped:&nbsp; and the day

is coming,



<P>when both he that sowed and they that reaped shall rejoice together;



<P>that is, if you hold out:&nbsp; "for in due season ye shall reap,



<P>if ye faint not."&nbsp; [John 4:36, Gal. 6:9]&nbsp; The crown is before

you,



<P>and it is an incorruptible one; so run, that you may obtain it.



<P>[1 Cor. 9:24-27]&nbsp; Some there be that set out for this crown,



<P>and, after they have gone far for it, another comes in,



<P>and takes it from them:&nbsp; hold fast, therefore, that you have;



<P>let no man take your crown.&nbsp; [Rev. 3:11]&nbsp; You are not yet

out



<P>of the gun-shot of the devil; you have not resisted unto blood,



<P>striving against sin; let the kingdom be always before you,



<P>and believe steadfastly concerning things that are invisible.



<P>Let nothing that is on this side the other world get within you;



<P>and, above all, look well to your own hearts, and to the lusts thereof,



<P>"for they are deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked";



<P>set your faces like a flint; you have all power in heaven and earth



<P>on your side.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{213}



<P>&lt;They do thank him for his exhortation>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then Christian thanked him for his exhortation; but told

him,



<P>withal, that they would have him speak further to them for their help



<P>the rest of the way, and the rather, for that they well knew



<P>that he was a prophet, and could tell them of things that might



<P>happen unto them, and also how they might resist and overcome them.



<P>To which request Faithful also consented.&nbsp; So Evangelist began



<P>as followeth:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;He predicteth what troubles they shall meet with in Vanity Fair,



<P>and encourageth them to steadfastness>



<P>EVAN.&nbsp; My sons, you have heard, in the words of the truth of the

gospel,



<P>that you must, through many tribulations, enter into



<P>the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; And, again, that in every city



<P>bonds and afflictions abide in you; and therefore you cannot expect



<P>that you should go long on your pilgrimage without them,



<P>in some sort or other.&nbsp; You have found something of the truth



<P>of these testimonies upon you already, and more will immediately follow;



<P>for now, as you see, you are almost out of this wilderness,



<P>and therefore you will soon come into a town that you will by and by



<P>see before you; and in that town you will be hardly beset with enemies,



<P>who will strain hard but they will kill you; and be you sure



<P>that one or both of you must seal the testimony which you hold,



<P>with blood; but be you faithful unto death, and the King will give you



<P>a crown of life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{214}



<P>&lt;He whose lot it will be there to suffer,



<P>will have the better of his brother>



<P>He that shall die there, although his death will be unnatural,



<P>and his pain perhaps great, he will yet have the better of his fellow;



<P>not only because he will be arrived at the Celestial City soonest,



<P>but because he will escape many miseries that the other will meet with



<P>in the rest of his journey.&nbsp; But when you are come to the town,



<P>and shall find fulfilled what I have here related,



<P>then remember your friend, and quit yourselves like men,



<P>and commit the keeping of your souls to your God in well-doing,



<P>as unto a faithful Creator.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{215}



<P>Then I saw in my dream, that when they were got out of the wilderness,



<P>they presently saw a town before them, and the name of that town



<P>is Vanity; and at the town there is a fair kept, called Vanity Fair:



<P>it is kept all the year long.&nbsp; It beareth the name of Vanity Fair



<P>because the town where it is kept is lighter than vanity;



<P>and, also because all that is there sold, or that cometh thither,



<P>is vanity.&nbsp; As is the saying of the wise, "all that cometh is vanity."



<P>[Eccl. 1; 2:11,17; 11:8; Isa. 11:17]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{216}



<P>This fair is no new-erected business, but a thing of ancient standing;



<P>I will show you the original of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;The antiquity of this fair>



<P>Almost five thousand years agone, there were pilgrims walking



<P>to the Celestial City, as these two honest persons are:



<P>and Beelzebub, Apollyon, and Legion, with their companions,



<P>perceiving by the path that the pilgrims made, that their way



<P>to the city lay through this town of Vanity, they contrived here



<P>to set up a fair; a fair wherein, should be sold all sorts of vanity,



<P>and that it should last all the year long:&nbsp; therefore at this fair



<P>are all such merchandise sold, as houses, lands, trades, places,



<P>honours, preferments, titles, countries, kingdoms, lusts, pleasures,



<P>and delights of all sorts, as whores, bawds, wives, husbands, children,



<P>masters, servants, lives, blood, bodies, souls, silver, gold, pearls,



<P>precious stones, and what not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And, moreover, at this fair there is at all times to be seen



<P>juggling cheats, games, plays, fools, apes, knaves, and rogues,



<P>and that of every kind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here are to be seen, too, and that for nothing, thefts, murders,



<P>adulteries, false swearers, and that of a blood-red colour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{217}



<P>&lt;The streets of this fair>



<P>And as in other fairs of less moment, there are the several



<P>rows and streets, under their proper names, where such and such wares



<P>are vended; so here likewise you have the proper places, rows,



<P>streets, (viz. countries and kingdoms), where the wares of this fair



<P>are soonest to be found.&nbsp; Here is the Britain Row, the French Row,



<P>the Italian Row, the Spanish Row, the German Row, where several sorts



<P>of vanities are to be sold.&nbsp; But, as in other fairs, some one commodity



<P>is as the chief of all the fair, so the ware of Rome and her merchandise



<P>is greatly promoted in this fair; only our English nation,



<P>with some others, have taken a dislike thereat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{218}



<P>&lt;Christ went through this fair>



<P>Now, as I said, the way to the Celestial City lies just through



<P>this town where this lusty fair is kept; and he that will go



<P>to the city, and yet not go through this town, must needs go out



<P>of the world.&nbsp; [1 Cor. 5:10]&nbsp; &lt;Christ bought nothing in

this fair>



<P>The Prince of princes himself, when here, went through this town



<P>to his own country, and that upon a fair day too; yea, and as I think,



<P>it was Beelzebub, the chief lord of this fair, that invited him



<P>to buy of his vanities; yea, would have made him lord of the fair,



<P>would he but have done him reverence as he went through the town.



<P>[Matt. 4:8, Luke 4:5-7]&nbsp; Yea, because he was such a person of honour,



<P>Beelzebub had him from street to street, and showed him



<P>all the kingdoms of the world in a little time, that he might,



<P>if possible, allure the Blessed One to cheapen and buy some



<P>of his vanities; but he had no mind to the merchandise,



<P>and therefore left the town, without laying out so much



<P>as one farthing upon these vanities.&nbsp; This fair, therefore,



<P>is an ancient thing, of long standing, and a very great fair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{219}



<P>&lt;The pilgrims enter the fair>



<P>Now these pilgrims, as I said, must needs go through this fair.



<P>&lt;The fair in a hubbub about them>&nbsp; Well, so they did:&nbsp;

but, behold,



<P>even as they entered into the fair, all the people in the fair



<P>were moved, and the town itself as it were in a hubbub about them;



<P>and that for several reasons:&nbsp; for--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{220}



<P>&lt;The first cause of the hubbub>



<P>First, The pilgrims were clothed with such kind of raiment



<P>as was diverse from the raiment of any that traded in that fair.



<P>The people, therefore, of the fair, made a great gazing upon them:



<P>some said they were fools, some they were bedlams,



<P>and some they are outlandish men.&nbsp; [1 Cor. 2:7-8]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{221}



<P>&lt;Second cause of the hubbub>



<P>Secondly, And as they wondered at their apparel, so they did likewise



<P>at their speech; for few could understand what they said;



<P>they naturally spoke the language of Canaan, but they that kept the

fair



<P>were the men of this world; so that, from one end of the fair



<P>to the other, they seemed barbarians each to the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{222}



<P>&lt;Third cause of the hubbub>



<P>Thirdly, But that which did not a little amuse the merchandisers was,



<P>that these pilgrims set very light by all their wares; they cared not



<P>so much as to look upon them; and if they called upon them to buy,



<P>they would put their fingers in their ears, and cry,



<P>Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and look upwards,



<P>signifying that their trade and traffic was in heaven.&nbsp; [Ps. 119:37,



<P>Phil. 3:19-20]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{223}



<P>&lt;Fourth cause of the hubbub>



<P>One chanced mockingly, beholding the carriage of the men,



<P>to say unto them, What will ye buy?&nbsp; But they, looking gravely

upon him,



<P>answered, "We buy the truth."&nbsp; [Prov. 23:23]&nbsp; &lt;They are

mocked>



<P>At that there was an occasion taken to despise the men the more;



<P>some mocking, some taunting, some speaking reproachfully,



<P>and some calling upon others to smite them.&nbsp; &lt;The fair in a

hubbub>



<P>At last things came to a hubbub and great stir in the fair,



<P>insomuch that all order was confounded.&nbsp; Now was word presently

brought



<P>to the great one of the fair, who quickly came down,



<P>and deputed some of his most trusty friends to take these men



<P>into examination, about whom the fair was almost overturned.



<P>&lt;They are examined>&nbsp; So the men were brought to examination;



<P>and they that sat upon them, asked them whence they came,



<P>whither they went, and what they did there, in such an unusual garb?



<P>&lt;They tell who they are, and whence they came>&nbsp; The men told

them



<P>that they were pilgrims and strangers in the world, and that they



<P>were going to their own country, which was the heavenly Jerusalem,



<P>[Heb. 11:13-16] and that they had given no occasion to the men



<P>of the town, nor yet to the merchandisers, thus to abuse them,



<P>and to let them in their journey, except it was for that,



<P>when one asked them what they would buy, they said they would buy



<P>the truth.&nbsp; &lt;They are not believed>&nbsp; But they that were

appointed to



<P>examine them did not believe them to be any other than bedlams and mad,



<P>or else such as came to put all things into a confusion in the fair.



<P>&lt;They are put in the cage>&nbsp; Therefore they took them and beat

them,



<P>and besmeared them with dirt, and then put them into the cage,



<P>that they might be made a spectacle to all the men of the fair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold Vanity Fair! the Pilgrims there



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are chain'd and stand beside:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so it was our Lord pass'd here,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on Mount Calvary died.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{224}



<P>&lt;Their behaviour in the cage>



<P>There, therefore, they lay for some time, and were made the objects



<P>of any man's sport, or malice, or revenge, the great one of the fair



<P>laughing still at all that befell them.&nbsp; But the men being patient,



<P>and not rendering railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing,



<P>and good words for bad, and kindness for injuries done,



<P>some men in the fair that were more observing, and less prejudiced



<P>than the rest, began to check and blame the baser sort



<P>for their continual abuses done by them to the men; they, therefore,



<P>in angry manner, let fly at them again, counting them as bad



<P>as the men in the cage, and telling them that they seemed confederates,



<P>and should be made partakers of their misfortunes.



<P>&lt;The men of the fair do fall out among themselves about these two

men>



<P>The other replied that, for aught they could see, the men were quiet,



<P>and sober, and intended nobody any harm; and that there were many



<P>that traded in their fair that were more worthy to be put into the cage,



<P>yea, and pillory too, than were the men they had abused.&nbsp; Thus,



<P>after divers words had passed on both sides, the men behaving themselves



<P>all the while very wisely and soberly before them,



<P>they fell to some blows among themselves, and did harm one to another.



<P>&lt;They are made the authors of this disturbance>&nbsp; Then were these



<P>two poor men brought before their examiners again, and there charged



<P>as being guilty of the late hubbub that had been in the fair.



<P>&lt;They are led up and down the fair in chains, for a terror to others>



<P>So they beat them pitifully, and hanged irons upon them,



<P>and led them in chains up and down the fair, for an example and a terror



<P>to others, lest any should speak in their behalf, or join themselves



<P>unto them.&nbsp; &lt;Some of the men of the fair won to them>



<P>But Christian and Faithful behaved themselves yet more wisely,



<P>and received the ignominy and shame that was cast upon them,



<P>with so much meekness and patience, that it won to their side,



<P>though but few in comparison of the rest, several of the men



<P>in the fair.&nbsp; This put the other party yet into greater rage,



<P>insomuch that they concluded the death of these two men.



<P>&lt;Their adversaries resolve to kill them>&nbsp; Wherefore they threatened,



<P>that the cage nor irons should serve their turn, but that they



<P>should die, for the abuse they had done, and for deluding the men



<P>of the fair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then were they remanded to the cage again, until further order should



<P>be taken with them.&nbsp; So they put them in, and made their feet fast



<P>in the stocks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{225}



<P>Here, therefore, they called again to mind what they had heard



<P>from their faithful friend Evangelist, and were the more confirmed



<P>in their way and sufferings by what he told them would happen to them.



<P>They also now comforted each other, that whose lot it was to suffer,



<P>even he should have the best of it; therefore each man secretly wished



<P>that he might have that preferment:&nbsp; but committing themselves

to



<P>the all-wise disposal of Him that ruleth all things, with much content,



<P>they abode in the condition in which they were, until they should be



<P>otherwise disposed of.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{226}



<P>&lt;They are again put into the cage, and after brought to trial>



<P>Then a convenient time being appointed, they brought them forth



<P>to their trial, in order to their condemnation.&nbsp; When the time

was come,



<P>they were brought before their enemies and arraigned.&nbsp; The judge's

name



<P>was Lord Hate-good.&nbsp; Their indictment was one and the same in substance,



<P>though somewhat varying in form, the contents whereof were this:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{227}



<P>&lt;Their indictment>



<P>"That they were enemies to and disturbers of their trade;



<P>that they had made commotions and divisions in the town,



<P>and had won a party to their own most dangerous opinions,



<P>in contempt of the law of their prince."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, FAITHFUL, play the man, speak for thy

God:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fear not the wicked's malice; nor their rod:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak boldly, man, the truth is on thy side:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Die for it, and to life in triumph ride.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{228}



<P>&lt;Faithful's answer for himself>



<P>Then Faithful began to answer, that he had only set himself against



<P>that which hath set itself against Him that is higher than the highest.



<P>And, said he, as for disturbance, I make none, being myself



<P>a man of peace; the parties that were won to us, were won by beholding



<P>our truth and innocence, and they are only turned from the worse



<P>to the better. And as to the king you talk of, since he is Beelzebub,



<P>the enemy of our Lord, I defy him and all his angels.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{229}



<P>Then proclamation was made, that they that had aught to say



<P>for their lord the king against the prisoner at the bar,



<P>should forthwith appear and give in their evidence. So there came in



<P>three witnesses, to wit, Envy, Superstition, and Pickthank.



<P>They were then asked if they knew the prisoner at the bar;



<P>and what they had to say for their lord the king against him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{230}



<P>&lt;Envy begins>



<P>Then stood forth Envy, and said to this effect:&nbsp; My Lord,



<P>I have known this man a long time, and will attest upon my oath



<P>before this honourable bench, that he is--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>JUDGE.&nbsp; Hold!&nbsp; Give him his oath.&nbsp; (So they sware him.)&nbsp;

Then he said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>ENVY.&nbsp; My Lord, this man, notwithstanding his plausible name,



<P>is one of the vilest men in our country.&nbsp; He neither regardeth



<P>prince nor people, law nor custom; but doth all that he can



<P>to possess all men with certain of his disloyal notions,



<P>which he in the general calls principles of faith and holiness.



<P>And, in particular, I heard him once myself affirm that Christianity



<P>and the customs of our town of Vanity were diametrically opposite,



<P>and could not be reconciled.&nbsp; By which saying, my Lord,



<P>he doth at once not only condemn all our laudable doings,



<P>but us in the doing of them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>JUDGE.&nbsp; Then did the Judge say to him, Hast thou any more to say?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>ENVY.&nbsp; My Lord, I could say much more, only I would not be tedious



<P>to the court.&nbsp; Yet, if need be, when the other gentlemen have given

in



<P>their evidence, rather than anything shall be wanting



<P>that will despatch him, I will enlarge my testimony against him.



<P>So he was bid to stand by.&nbsp; Then they called Superstition,



<P>and bid him look upon the prisoner.&nbsp; They also asked, what he could

say



<P>for their lord the king against him.&nbsp; Then they sware him; so he

began.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{231}



<P>&lt;Superstition follows>



<P>SUPER.&nbsp; My Lord, I have no great acquaintance with this man,



<P>nor do I desire to have further knowledge of him; however, this I know,



<P>that he is a very pestilent fellow, from some discourse that,



<P>the other day, I had with him in this town; for then, talking with him,



<P>I heard him say, that our religion was naught, and such by which



<P>a man could by no means please God.&nbsp; Which sayings of his, my Lord,



<P>your Lordship very well knows, what necessarily thence will follow,



<P>to wit, that we do still worship in vain, are yet in our sins,



<P>and finally shall be damned; and this is that which I have to say.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{232}



<P>Then was Pickthank sworn, and bid say what he knew,



<P>in behalf of their lord the king, against the prisoner at the bar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Pickthank's testimony>



<P>Pick. My Lord, and you gentlemen all, This fellow I have known



<P>of a long time, and have heard him speak things that ought not



<P>to be spoke; for he hath railed on our noble prince Beelzebub,



<P>and hath spoken contemptibly of his honourable friends,



<P>&lt;Sins are all lords and great ones> whose names are



<P>the Lord Old Man, the Lord Carnal Delight, the Lord Luxurious,



<P>the Lord Desire of Vain Glory, my old Lord Lechery, Sir Having Greedy,



<P>with all the rest of our nobility; and he hath said, moreover,



<P>That if all men were of his mind, if possible, there is not



<P>one of these noblemen should have any longer a being in this town.



<P>Besides, he hath not been afraid to rail on you, my Lord,



<P>who are now appointed to be his judge, calling you an ungodly villain,



<P>with many other such like vilifying terms, with which



<P>he hath bespattered most of the gentry of our town.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{233}



<P>When this Pickthank had told his tale, the Judge directed his speech



<P>to the prisoner at the bar, saying, Thou runagate, heretic, and traitor,



<P>hast thou heard what these honest gentlemen have witnessed against thee?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; May I speak a few words in my own defence?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>JUDGE.&nbsp; Sirrah! sirrah! thou deservest to live no longer,



<P>but to be slain immediately upon the place; yet, that all men may see



<P>our gentleness towards thee, let us hear what thou, vile runagate,



<P>hast to say.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{234}



<P>&lt;Faithful's defence of himself>



<P>FAITH.&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; I say, then, in answer to what Mr. Envy hath spoken,



<P>I never said aught but this, That what rule, or laws, or customs,



<P>or people, were flat against the Word of God, are diametrically opposite



<P>to Christianity.&nbsp; If I have said amiss in this, convince me of

my error,



<P>and I am ready here before you to make my recantation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{235}



<P>2.&nbsp; As to the second, to wit, Mr. Superstition, and his charge



<P>against me, I said only this, That in the worship of God



<P>there is required a Divine faith; but there can be no Divine faith



<P>without a Divine revelation of the will of God.&nbsp; Therefore,



<P>whatever is thrust into the worship of God that is not agreeable



<P>to Divine revelation, cannot be done but by a human faith,



<P>which faith will not be profitable to eternal life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{236}



<P>3. As to what Mr. Pickthank hath said, I say (avoiding terms,



<P>as that I am said to rail, and the like) that the prince of this town,



<P>with all the rabblement, his attendants, by this gentleman named,



<P>are more fit for a being in hell, than in this town and country:



<P>and so, the Lord have mercy upon me!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{237}



<P>&lt;The Judge's speech to the jury>



<P>Then the Judge called to the jury (who all this while stood by,



<P>to hear and observe):&nbsp; Gentlemen of the jury, you see this man



<P>about whom so great an uproar hath been made in this town.



<P>You have also heard what these worthy gentlemen have witnessed



<P>against him.&nbsp; Also you have heard his reply and confession.



<P>It lieth now in your breasts to hang him or save his life;



<P>but yet I think meet to instruct you into our law.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{238}



<P>There was an Act made in the days of Pharaoh the Great,



<P>servant to our prince, that lest those of a contrary religion



<P>should multiply and grow too strong for him, their males should be



<P>thrown into the river.&nbsp; [Exo. 1:22]&nbsp; There was also an Act

made



<P>in the days of Nebuchadnezzar the Great, another of his servants,



<P>that whosoever would not fall down and worship his golden image,



<P>should be thrown into a fiery furnace.&nbsp; [Dan. 3:6]&nbsp; There

was also



<P>an Act made in the days of Darius, that whoso, for some time,



<P>called upon any god but him, should be cast into the lions' den.



<P>[Dan. 6]&nbsp; Now the substance of these laws this rebel has broken,



<P>not only in thought, (which is not to be borne), but also



<P>in word and deed; which must therefore needs be intolerable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{239}



<P>For that of Pharaoh, his law was made upon a supposition,



<P>to prevent mischief, no crime being yet apparent;



<P>but here is a crime apparent.&nbsp; For the second and third,



<P>you see he disputeth against our religion; and for the treason



<P>he hath confessed, he deserveth to die the death.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{240}



<P>&lt;The jury and their names>



<P>Then went the jury out, whose names were, Mr. Blind-man, Mr. No-good,



<P>Mr. Malice, Mr. Love-lust, Mr. Live-loose, Mr. Heady, Mr. High-mind,



<P>Mr. Enmity, Mr. Liar, Mr. Cruelty, Mr. Hate-light, and Mr. Implacable;



<P>who every one gave in his private verdict against him among themselves,



<P>and afterwards unanimously concluded to bring him in guilty



<P>before the Judge.&nbsp; &lt;Everyones private verdict>&nbsp; And first,



<P>among themselves, Mr. Blind-man, the foreman, said,



<P>I see clearly that this man is a heretic.&nbsp; Then said Mr. No-good,



<P>Away with such a fellow from the earth.&nbsp; Ay, said Mr. Malice,



<P>for I hate the very looks of him.&nbsp; Then said Mr. Love-lust,



<P>I could never endure him.&nbsp; Nor I, said Mr. Live-loose,



<P>for he would always be condemning my way.&nbsp; Hang him, hang him,



<P>said Mr. Heady.&nbsp; A sorry scrub, said Mr. High-mind.



<P>My heart riseth against him, said Mr. Enmity.&nbsp; He is a rogue,



<P>said Mr. Liar.&nbsp; Hanging is too good for him, said Mr. Cruelty.



<P>Let us despatch him out of the way, said Mr. Hate-light.



<P>Then said Mr. Implacable, Might I have all the world given me,



<P>I could not be reconciled to him; &lt;They conclude to bring him in

guilty



<P>of death> therefore, let us forthwith bring him in guilty of death.



<P>And so they did; therefore he was presently condemned to be had



<P>from the place where he was, to the place from whence he came,



<P>and there to be put to the most cruel death that could be invented.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{241}



<P>&lt;The cruel death of Faithful>



<P>They therefore brought him out, to do with him according to their law;



<P>and, first, they scourged him, then they buffeted him,



<P>then they lanced his flesh with knives; after that, they stoned him



<P>with stones, then pricked him with their swords; and, last of all,



<P>they burned him to ashes at the stake.&nbsp; Thus came Faithful to his

end.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{242}



<P>&lt;A chariot and horses wait to take away Faithful>



<P>Now I saw that there stood behind the multitude a chariot



<P>and a couple of horses, waiting for Faithful, who (so soon as



<P>his adversaries had despatched him) was taken up into it,



<P>and straightway was carried up through the clouds,



<P>with sound of trumpet, the nearest way to the Celestial Gate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brave FAITHFUL, bravely done in word

and deed;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge, witnesses, and jury have, instead



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of overcoming thee, but shown their rage:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they are dead, thou'lt live from

age to age*.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>*In the New Heaven and New Earth.&nbsp; {footnote from one edition}

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{243}



<P>&lt;Christian is still alive>



<P>But as for Christian, he had some respite, and was remanded



<P>back to prison.&nbsp; So he there remained for a space;



<P>but He that overrules all things, having the power of their rage



<P>in his own hand, so wrought it about, that Christian for that time



<P>escaped them, and went his way.&nbsp; And as he went, he sang, saying--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;The song that Christian made of Faithful after his death>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, Faithful, thou hast faithfully profest



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto thy Lord; with whom thou shalt be blest,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When faithless ones, with all their vain delights,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are crying out under their hellish plights:



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sing, Faithful, sing, and let thy name survive;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For though they kill'd thee, thou art yet alive!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{244}



<P>&lt;Christian has another companion>



<P>Now I saw in my dream, that Christian went not forth alone,



<P>for there was one whose name was Hopeful (being made so



<P>by the beholding of Christian and Faithful in their words and behaviour,



<P>in their sufferings at the fair), who joined himself unto him, and,



<P>entering into a brotherly covenant, told him that he would be



<P>his companion.&nbsp; Thus, one died to bear testimony to the truth,



<P>and another rises out of his ashes, to be a companion with Christian



<P>in his pilgrimage.&nbsp; &lt;There are more of the men of the fair will

follow>



<P>This Hopeful also told Christian, that there were many more



<P>of the men in the fair, that would take their time and follow after.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{245}



<P>&lt;They overtake By-ends>



<P>So I saw that quickly after they were got out of the fair,



<P>they overtook one that was going before them, whose name was By-ends:



<P>so they said to him, What countryman, Sir? and how far go you this way?



<P>He told them that he came from the town of Fair-speech,



<P>and he was going to the Celestial City (but told them not his name).

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From Fair-speech! said Christian.&nbsp; Is there any good that lives

there?



<P>[Prov. 26:25]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; Yes, said By-ends, I hope.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Pray, Sir, what may I call you? said Christian.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;By-ends loath to tell his name>



<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; I am a stranger to you, and you to me:&nbsp; if you be

going



<P>this way, I shall be glad of your company; if not, I must be content.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; This town of Fair-speech, said Christian, I have heard of;



<P>and, as I remember, they say it is a wealthy place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; Yes, I will assure you that it is; and I have very many



<P>rich kindred there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{246}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Pray, who are your kindred there? if a man may be so bold.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; Almost the whole town; and in particular, my Lord Turn-about,



<P>my Lord Time-server, my Lord Fair-speech, (from whose ancestors



<P>that town first took its name), also Mr. Smooth-man,



<P>Mr. Facing-both-ways, Mr. Any-thing; and the parson of our parish,



<P>Mr. Two-tongues, was my mother's own brother by father's side;



<P>and to tell you the truth, I am become a gentleman of good quality,



<P>yet my great-grandfather was but a waterman, looking one way



<P>and rowing another, and I got most of my estate by the same occupation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Are you a married man?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;The wife and kindred of By-ends>



<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; Yes, and my wife is a very virtuous woman,



<P>the daughter of a virtuous woman; she was my Lady Feigning's daughter,



<P>therefore she came of a very honourable family, and is arrived



<P>to such a pitch of breeding, that she knows how to carry it to all,



<P>even to prince and peasant.&nbsp; &lt;Where By-ends differs from others



<P>in religion>&nbsp; It is true we somewhat differ in religion



<P>from those of the stricter sort, yet but in two small points:



<P>first, we never strive against wind and tide; secondly,



<P>we are always most zealous when religion goes in his silver slippers;



<P>we love much to walk with him in the street, if the sun shines,



<P>and the people applaud him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{247}



<P>Then Christian stepped a little aside to his fellow, Hopeful,



<P>saying, It runs in my mind that this is one By-ends of Fair-speech;



<P>and if it be he, we have as very a knave in our company as dwelleth



<P>in all these parts.&nbsp; Then said Hopeful, Ask him; methinks he should

not



<P>be ashamed of his name.&nbsp; So Christian came up with him again, and

said,



<P>Sir, you talk as if you knew something more than all the world doth;



<P>and if I take not my mark amiss, I deem I have half a guess of you:



<P>Is not your name Mr. By-ends, of Fair-speech?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; This is not my name, but indeed it is a nick-name



<P>that is given me by some that cannot abide me:&nbsp; and I must be content



<P>to bear it as a reproach, as other good men have borne theirs before

me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{247}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But did you never give an occasion to men to call you



<P>by this name?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;How By-ends got his name>



<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; Never, never! The worst that ever I did to give them



<P>an occasion to give me this name was, that I had always the luck



<P>to jump in my judgment with the present way of the times,



<P>whatever it was, and my chance was to get thereby; but if things



<P>are thus cast upon me, let me count them, a blessing;



<P>but let not the malicious load me therefore with reproach.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{248}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I thought, indeed, that you were the man that I heard of;



<P>and to tell you what I think, I fear this name belongs to you



<P>more properly than you are willing we should think it doth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;He desires to keep company with Christian>



<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; Well, if you will thus imagine, I cannot help it;



<P>you shall find me a fair company-keeper, if you will still admit me



<P>your associate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; If you will go with us, you must go against wind and tide;



<P>the which, I perceive, is against your opinion; you must also own



<P>religion in his rags, as well as when in his silver slippers;



<P>and stand by him, too, when bound in irons, as well as when



<P>he walketh the streets with applause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; You must not impose, nor lord it over my faith;



<P>leave me to my liberty, and let me go with you.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Not a step further, unless you will do in what I propound

as we.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said By-ends, I shall never desert my old principles,



<P>since they are harmless and profitable.&nbsp; If I may not go with you,



<P>I must do as I did before you overtook me, even go by myself,



<P>until some overtake me that will be glad of my company.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{249}



<P>&lt;By-ends and Christian part>



<P>Now I saw in my dream that Christian and Hopeful forsook him,



<P>and kept their distance before him; but one of them looking back,



<P>saw three men following Mr. By-ends, and behold, as they



<P>came up with him, he made them a very low conge {conge'};



<P>and they also gave him a compliment.&nbsp; &lt;He has new companions>



<P>The men's names were Mr. Hold-the-world, Mr. Money-love,



<P>and Mr. Save-all; men that Mr. By-ends had formerly been



<P>acquainted with; for in their minority they were schoolfellows,



<P>and were taught by one Mr. Gripe-man, a schoolmaster in Love-gain,



<P>which is a market town in the county of Coveting, in the north.



<P>This schoolmaster taught them the art of getting, either by violence,



<P>cozenage, flattery, lying, or by putting on the guise of religion;



<P>and these four gentlemen had attained much of the art of their master,



<P>so that they could each of them have kept such a school themselves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{250}



<P>Well, when they had, as I said, thus saluted each other,



<P>Mr. Money-love said to Mr. By-ends, Who are they upon the road



<P>before us? (for Christian and Hopeful were yet within view).

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;By-ends' character of the pilgrims>



<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; They are a couple of far countrymen, that, after their

mode,



<P>are going on pilgrimage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MONEY-LOVE.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; Why did they not stay, that we might have

had



<P>their good company? for they, and we, and you, Sir, I hope,



<P>are all going on pilgrimage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>BY-ENDS.&nbsp; We are so, indeed; but the men before us are so rigid,



<P>and love so much their own notions, and do also so lightly esteem



<P>the opinions of others, that let a man be never so godly,



<P>yet if he jumps not with them in all things, they thrust him



<P>quite out of their company.

<P>&lt;Evangelist convinces Christian of his error>



<P>EVAN.&nbsp; Then, said Evangelist, stand still a little, that I may

show thee



<P>the words of God.&nbsp; So he stood trembling.&nbsp; Then said Evangelist,



<P>"See that ye refuse not him that speaketh.&nbsp; For if they escaped

not



<P>who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape,



<P>if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven."&nbsp; [Heb. 12:25]



<P>He said, moreover, "Now the just shall live by faith:&nbsp; but if any

man



<P>draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."&nbsp; [Heb. 10:38]



<P>He also did thus apply them:&nbsp; Thou art the man that art running

into



<P>this misery; thou hast begun to reject the counsel of the Most High,



<P>and to draw back thy foot from the way of peace, even almost



<P>to the hazarding of thy perdition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{52}



<P>Then Christian fell down at his feet as dead, crying, "Woe is me,



<P>for I am undone!"&nbsp; At the sight of which Evangelist caught him



<P>by the right hand, saying, "All manner of sin and blasphemies



<P>shall be forgiven unto men." [Matt. 12:31, Mark 3:28]



<P>"Be not faithless, but believing."&nbsp; [John 20:27]&nbsp; Then did

Christian



<P>again a little revive, and stood up trembling, as at first,



<P>before Evangelist.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{53}



<P>&lt;Mr. Worldly Wiseman described by Evangelist>



<P>Then Evangelist proceeded, saying, Give more earnest heed



<P>to the things that I shall tell thee of.&nbsp; I will now show thee



<P>who it was that deluded thee, and who it was also to whom he sent thee.



<P>--The man that met thee is one Worldly Wiseman, and rightly is he



<P>so called; partly, because he savoureth only the doctrine of this world,



<P>[1 John 4:5] (therefore he always goes to the town of Morality



<P>to church):&nbsp; and partly because he loveth that doctrine best,



<P>for it saveth him best from the cross.&nbsp; [Gal 6:12]&nbsp; And because



<P>he is of this carnal temper, therefore he seeketh to pervert my ways,



<P>though right.&nbsp; Now there are three things in this man's counsel,



<P>that thou must utterly abhor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Evangelist discovers the deceit of Mr. Worldly Wiseman>

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>1.&nbsp; His turning thee out of the way.



<P>2.&nbsp; His labouring to render the cross odious to thee.&nbsp; And,



<P>3.&nbsp; His setting thy feet in that way that leadeth unto



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the administration of death.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{54}



<P>First, Thou must abhor his turning thee out of the way;



<P>and thine own consenting thereunto:&nbsp; because this is to reject



<P>the counsel of God for the sake of the counsel of a Worldly Wiseman.



<P>The Lord says, "Strive to enter in at the strait gate" [Luke 13:24],



<P>the gate to which I sent thee; for "strait is the gate that leadeth



<P>unto life, and few there be that find it." [Matt. 7:14]



<P>From this little wicket-gate, and from the way thereto,



<P>hath this wicked man turned thee, to the bringing of thee



<P>almost to destruction; hate, therefore, his turning thee out of the

way,



<P>and abhor thyself for hearkening to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{55}



<P>Secondly, Thou must abhor his labouring to render the cross



<P>odious unto thee; for thou art to prefer it "before the treasures



<P>in Egypt."&nbsp; [Heb. 11:25,26]&nbsp; Besides the King of glory hath

told thee,



<P>that he that "will save his life shall lose it."&nbsp; [Mark 8:35;



<P>John 12:25; Matt. 10:39]&nbsp; And, "He that cometh after me,



<P>and hateth not his father, and mother, and wife, and children,



<P>and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also,



<P>he cannot be my disciple."&nbsp; [Luke 14:26]&nbsp; I say, therefore,



<P>for man to labour to persuade thee, that that shall be thy death,



<P>without which, THE TRUTH hath said, thou canst not have eternal life;



<P>this doctrine thou must abhor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{56}



<P>Thirdly, Thou must hate his setting of thy feet in the way that leadeth



<P>to the ministration of death.&nbsp; And for this thou must consider

to whom



<P>he sent thee, and also how unable that person was to deliver thee



<P>from thy burden.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{57}



<P>&lt;The bond-woman>



<P>He to whom thou wast sent for ease, being by name Legality,



<P>is the son of the bond-woman which now is, and is in bondage



<P>with her children [Gal 4:21-27]; and is, in a mystery, this Mount Sinai,



<P>which thou hast feared will fall on thy head.&nbsp; Now, if she,



<P>with her children, are in bondage, how canst thou expect by them



<P>to be made free?&nbsp; This Legality, therefore, is not able to set

thee free



<P>from thy burden.&nbsp; No man was as yet ever rid of his burden by him;

no,



<P>nor ever is like to be:&nbsp; ye cannot be justified by the works of

the law;



<P>for by the deeds of the law no man living can be rid of his burden:



<P>therefore, Mr. Worldly Wiseman is an alien, and Mr. Legality is a cheat;



<P>and for his son Civility, notwithstanding his simpering looks,



<P>he is but a hypocrite and cannot help thee.&nbsp; Believe me,



<P>there is nothing in all this noise, that thou hast heard of these



<P>sottish men, but a design to beguile thee of thy salvation,



<P>by turning thee from the way in which I had set thee.&nbsp; After this,



<P>Evangelist called aloud to the heavens for confirmation of what



<P>he had said:&nbsp; and with that there came words and fire



<P>out of the mountain under which poor Christian stood, that made



<P>the hair of his flesh stand up.&nbsp; The words were thus pronounced:



<P>`As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse;



<P>for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things



<P>which are written in the book of the law to do them.'&nbsp; [Gal. 3:10]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{58}



<P>Now Christian looked for nothing but death, and began



<P>to cry out lamentably; even cursing the time in which he met



<P>with Mr. Worldly Wiseman; still calling himself a thousand fools



<P>for hearkening to his counsel; he also was greatly ashamed to think



<P>that this gentleman's arguments, flowing only from the flesh,



<P>should have the prevalency with him as to cause him to forsake



<P>the right way.&nbsp; This done, he applied himself again to Evangelist



<P>in words and sense as follow:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{59}



<P>&lt;Christian inquires if he may yet be happy>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Sir, what think you?&nbsp; Is there hope?&nbsp; May I now

go back



<P>and go up to the wicket-gate?&nbsp; Shall I not be abandoned for this,



<P>and sent back from thence ashamed?&nbsp; I am sorry I have hearkened

to



<P>this man's counsel.&nbsp; But may my sin be forgiven?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Evangelist comforts him>



<P>EVAN.&nbsp; Then said Evangelist to him, Thy sin is very great,



<P>for by it thou hast committed two evils:&nbsp; thou hast forsaken the

way



<P>that is good, to tread in forbidden paths; yet will the man at the gate



<P>receive thee, for he has goodwill for men; only, said he,



<P>take heed that thou turn not aside again, `lest thou perish from



<P>the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.'&nbsp; [Ps. 2:12]



<P>Then did Christian address himself to go back; and Evangelist,



<P>after he had kissed him, gave him one smile, and bid him God-speed.



<P>So he went on with haste, neither spake he to any man by the way;



<P>nor, if any asked him, would he vouchsafe them an answer.



<P>He went like one that was all the while treading on forbidden ground,



<P>and could by no means think himself safe, till again he was got



<P>into the way which he left, to follow Mr. Worldly Wiseman's counsel.



<P>So, in process of time, Christian got up to the gate.



<P>Now, over the gate there was written, `Knock, and it shall be opened



<P>unto you.' [Matt 7:8]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{60}



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He that will enter in must first without



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand knocking at the Gate, nor need he doubt



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is A KNOCKER but to enter in;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For God can love him, and forgive his sin."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He knocked, therefore, more than once or twice, saying--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May I now enter here?&nbsp; Will he within



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open to sorry me, though I have been



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An undeserving rebel?&nbsp; Then shall I



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not fail to sing his lasting praise on high."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last there came a grave person to the gate, named Good-will,



<P>who asked who was there? and whence he came? and what he would have?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{61}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Here is a poor burdened sinner.&nbsp; I come from



<P>the City of Destruction, but am going to Mount Zion,



<P>that I may be delivered from the wrath to come.&nbsp; I would therefore,



<P>Sir, since I am informed that by this gate is the way thither,



<P>know if you are willing to let me in?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;The gate will be opened to broken-hearted sinners>



<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; I am willing with all my heart, said he; and with that



<P>he opened the gate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{62}



<P>So when Christian was stepping in, the other gave him a pull.



<P>Then said Christian, What means that?&nbsp; The other told him.



<P>A little distance from this gate, there is erected a strong castle,



<P>of which Beelzebub is the captain; &lt;Satan envies those that enter



<P>the strait gate> from thence, both he and them that are with him



<P>shoot arrows at those that come up to this gate, if haply they may die



<P>before they can enter in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Christian entered the gate with joy and trembling>



<P>Then said Christian, I rejoice and tremble.&nbsp; So when he was got

in,



<P>the man of the gate asked him who directed him thither?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{63}



<P>&lt;Talk between Good-will and Christian>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Evangelist bid me come hither, and knock, (as I did);



<P>and he said that you, Sir, would tell me what I must do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; An open door is set before thee, and no man can shut

it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Now I begin to reap the benefits of my hazards.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; But how is it that you came alone?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Because none of my neighbours saw their danger, as I saw

mine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; Did any of them know of your coming?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes; my wife and children saw me at the first, and called

after me



<P>to turn again; also, some of my neighbours stood crying



<P>and calling after me to return; but I put my fingers in my ears,



<P>and so came on my way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; But did none of them follow you, to persuade you to

go back?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, both Obstinate and Pliable; but when they saw



<P>that they could not prevail, Obstinate went railing back,



<P>but Pliable came with me a little way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; But why did he not come through?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{64}



<P>&lt;A man may have company when he sets out for heaven,



<P>and yet go thither alone>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; We, indeed, came both together, until we came



<P>at the Slough of Despond, into the which we also suddenly fell.



<P>And then was my neighbour, Pliable, discouraged, and would not



<P>venture further.&nbsp; Wherefore, getting out again on that side



<P>next to his own house, he told me I should possess the brave country



<P>alone for him; so he went his way, and I came mine--



<P>he after Obstinate, and I to this gate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; Then said Good-will, Alas, poor man! is the celestial

glory



<P>of so small esteem with him, that he counteth it not worth



<P>running the hazards of a few difficulties to obtain it?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{65}



<P>&lt;Christian accuses himself before the man at the gate>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Truly, said Christian, I have said the truth of Pliable,



<P>and if I should also say all the truth of myself, it will appear



<P>there is no betterment betwixt him and myself.&nbsp; It is true,



<P>he went back to his own house, but I also turned aside to go



<P>in the way of death, being persuaded thereto by the carnal arguments



<P>of one Mr. Worldly Wiseman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; Oh, did he light upon you?&nbsp; What! he would have

had you



<P>a sought for ease at the hands of Mr. Legality.&nbsp; They are, both

of them,



<P>a very cheat.&nbsp; But did you take his counsel?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, as far as I durst; I went to find out Mr. Legality,



<P>until I thought that the mountain that stands by his house



<P>would have fallen upon my head; wherefore there I was forced to stop.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; That mountain has been the death of many,



<P>and will be the death of many more; it is well you escaped being



<P>by it dashed in pieces.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, truly, I do not know what had become of me there,



<P>had not Evangelist happily met me again, as I was musing in the midst



<P>of my dumps; but it was God's mercy that he came to me again, for else



<P>I had never come hither.&nbsp; But now I am come, such a one as I am,



<P>more fit, indeed, for death, by that mountain, than thus to stand



<P>talking with my lord; but, oh, what a favour is this to me,



<P>that yet I am admitted entrance here!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{66}



<P>&lt;Christian comforted again>



<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; We make no objections against any, notwithstanding

all



<P>that they have done before they came hither.&nbsp; They are in no wise



<P>cast out [John vi.37]; and therefore, good Christian, come a little

way



<P>with me, and I will teach thee about the way thou must go.



<P>&lt;Christian directed yet on his way>&nbsp; Look before thee;



<P>dost thou see this narrow way?&nbsp; THAT is the way thou must go;



<P>it was cast up by the patriarchs, prophets, Christ, and his apostles;



<P>and it is as straight as a rule can make it.&nbsp; This is the way



<P>thou must go.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{67}



<P>&lt;Christian afraid of losing his way>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But, said Christian, are there no turnings or windings by

which



<P>a stranger may lose his way?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>GOOD-WILL.&nbsp; Yes, there are many ways butt down upon this,



<P>and they are crooked and wide.&nbsp; But thus thou mayest distinguish



<P>the right from the wrong, the right only being straight and narrow.



<P>[Matt 7:14]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{68}



<P>&lt;Christian weary of his burden>



<P>Then I saw in my dream that Christian asked him further



<P>if he could not help him off with his burden that was upon his back;



<P>for as yet he had not got rid thereof, nor could he by any means



<P>get it off without help.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;There is no deliverance from guilt and burden of sin,



<P>but by the death and blood of Christ>



<P>He told him, As to thy burden, be content to bear it, until thou comest



<P>to the place of deliverance; for there it will fall from thy back



<P>of itself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{69}



<P>Then Christian began to gird up his loins, and to address himself



<P>to his journey.&nbsp; So the other told him, That by that he was gone



<P>some distance from the gate, he would come at the house



<P>of the Interpreter, at whose door he should knock, and he would show

him



<P>excellent things.&nbsp; Then Christian took his leave of his friend,



<P>and he again bid him God-speed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{70}



<P>&lt;Christian comes to the house of the interpreter>



<P>Then he went on till he came to the house of the Interpreter,



<P>where he knocked over and over; at last one came to the door,



<P>and asked who was there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{71}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Sir, here is a traveller, who was bid by an acquaintance



<P>of the good-man of this house to call here for my profit;



<P>I would therefore speak with the master of the house.



<P>So he called for the master of the house, who, after a little time,



<P>came to Christian, and asked him what he would have.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;He is entertained>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Sir, said Christian, I am a man that am come from



<P>the City of Destruction, and am going to the Mount Zion;



<P>and I was told by the man that stands at the gate, at the head



<P>of this way, that if I called here, you would show me excellent things,



<P>such as would be a help to me in my journey.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{72}



<P>&lt;Illumination>



<P>INTER.&nbsp; Then said the Interpreter, Come in; I will show that



<P>which will be profitable to thee.&nbsp; So he commanded his man



<P>to light the candle, and bid Christian follow him:&nbsp; so he had him



<P>into a private room, &lt;Christian sees a grave picture> and bid his

man



<P>open a door; the which when he had done, Christian saw the picture



<P>of a very grave person hang up against the wall; and this was



<P>the fashion of it.&nbsp; &lt;The fashion of the picture>&nbsp; It had

eyes



<P>lifted up to heaven, the best of books in his hand, the law of truth



<P>was written upon his lips, the world was behind his back.



<P>It stood as if it pleaded with men, and a crown of gold did hang



<P>over his head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian, What meaneth this?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{73}



<P>&lt;The meaning of the picture>



<P>INTER.&nbsp; The man whose picture this is, is one of a thousand;



<P>he can beget children [1 Cor. 4:15], travail in birth with children



<P>[Gal. 4:19], and nurse them himself when they are born.



<P>And whereas thou seest him with his eyes lift up to heaven,



<P>the best of books in his hand, and the law of truth writ on his lips,



<P>it is to show thee that his work is to know and unfold dark things



<P>to sinners; even as also thou seest him stand as if he pleaded with

men:



<P>and whereas thou seest the world as cast behind him, and that a crown



<P>hangs over his head, that is to show thee that slighting and despising



<P>the things that are present, for the love that he hath



<P>to his Master's service, he is sure in the world that comes next



<P>to have glory for his reward.&nbsp; &lt;Why he showed him the picture

first>



<P>Now, said the Interpreter, I have showed thee this picture first,



<P>because the man whose picture this is, is the only man whom



<P>the Lord of the place whither thou art going, hath authorised to be



<P>thy guide in all difficult places thou mayest meet with in the way;



<P>wherefore, take good heed to what I have shewed thee, and bear well



<P>in thy mind what thou hast seen, lest in thy journey thou meet with



<P>some that pretend to lead thee right, but their way goes down to death.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{74}



<P>Then he took him by the hand, and led him into a very large parlour



<P>that was full of dust, because never swept; the which after he had



<P>reviewed a little while, the Interpreter called for a man to sweep.



<P>Now, when he began to sweep, the dust began so abundantly to fly about,



<P>that Christian had almost therewith been choked.&nbsp; Then said



<P>the Interpreter to a damsel that stood by, Bring hither the water,



<P>and sprinkle the room; the which, when she had done,



<P>it was swept and cleansed with pleasure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{75}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian, What means this?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>INTER.&nbsp; The Interpreter answered, This parlour is the heart of

a man



<P>that was never sanctified by the sweet grace of the gospel;



<P>the dust is his original sin and inward corruptions, that have defiled



<P>the whole man.&nbsp; He that began to sweep at first, is the Law;



<P>but she that brought water, and did sprinkle it, is the Gospel.



<P>Now, whereas thou sawest, that so soon as the first began to sweep,



<P>the dust did so fly about that the room by him could not be cleansed,



<P>but that thou wast almost choked therewith; this is to shew thee,



<P>that the law, instead of cleansing the heart (by its working) from sin,



<P>doth revive, put strength into, and increase it in the soul,



<P>even as it doth discover and forbid it, for it doth not give power



<P>to subdue.&nbsp; [Rom. 7:6; 1 Cor. 15:56; Rom. 5:20]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{76}



<P>Again, as thou sawest the damsel sprinkle the room with water,



<P>upon which it was cleansed with pleasure; this is to show thee,



<P>that when the gospel comes in the sweet and precious influences thereof



<P>to the heart, then, I say, even as thou sawest the damsel lay the dust



<P>by sprinkling the floor with water, so is sin vanquished and subdued,



<P>and the soul made clean through the faith of it, and consequently fit



<P>for the King of glory to inhabit.&nbsp; [John 15:3; Eph. 5:26; Acts

15:9;



<P>Rom. 16:25,26; John 15:13]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{77}



<P>I saw, moreover, in my dream, that the Interpreter took him by the hand,



<P>and had him into a little room, where sat two little children,



<P>each one in his chair.&nbsp; &lt;He showed him passion and patience>



<P>The name of the eldest was Passion, and the name of the other Patience.



<P>Passion seemed to be much discontented; but Patience was very quiet.



<P>Then Christian asked, What is the reason of the discontent of Passion?



<P>&lt;Passion will have all now.&nbsp; Patience is for waiting>



<P>The Interpreter answered, The Governor of them would have him stay



<P>for his best things till the beginning of the next year;



<P>but he will have all now:&nbsp; but Patience is willing to wait.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Passion has his desire>



<P>Then I saw that one came to Passion, and brought him a bag of treasure,



<P>and poured it down at his feet, the which he took up



<P>and rejoiced therein, and withal laughed Patience to scorn.



<P>&lt;And quickly lavishes all away>&nbsp; But I beheld but a while,



<P>and he had lavished all away, and had nothing left him but rags.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{78}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian to the Interpreter, Expound this matter



<P>more fully to me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;The matter expounded>



<P>INTER.&nbsp; So he said, These two lads are figures:&nbsp; Passion,

of the men



<P>of this world; and Patience, of the men of that which is to come;



<P>for as here thou seest, Passion will have all now this year,



<P>that is to say, in this world; so are the men of this world,



<P>they must have all their good things now, they cannot stay



<P>till next year, that is until the next world, for their portion of good.



<P>&lt;The worldly man for a bird in the hand>&nbsp; That proverb,



<P>`A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush', is of more authority



<P>with them than are all the Divine testimonies of the good of the world



<P>to come.&nbsp; But as thou sawest that he had quickly lavished all away,



<P>and had presently left him nothing but rags; so will it be with all



<P>such men at the end of this world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Patience has the best wisdom>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian, Now I see that Patience has the best

wisdom,



<P>and that upon many accounts.&nbsp; First, because he stays



<P>for the best things.&nbsp; Second, and also because he will have



<P>the glory of his, when the other has nothing but rags.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{79}



<P>&lt;Things that are first must give place; but things that are last



<P>are lasting>



<P>INTER.&nbsp; Nay, you may add another, to wit, the glory of the next

world



<P>will never wear out; but these are suddenly gone.&nbsp; Therefore Passion



<P>had not so much reason to laugh at Patience, because he had



<P>his good things first, as Patience will have to laugh at Passion,



<P>because he had his best things last; for first must give place to last,



<P>because last must have his time to come; but last gives place



<P>to nothing; for there is not another to succeed.&nbsp; He, therefore,



<P>that hath his portion first, must needs have a time to spend it;



<P>but he that hath his portion last, must have it lastingly;



<P>&lt;Dives had his good things first> therefore it is said of Dives,



<P>"Thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things, and likewise



<P>Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented."



<P>[Luke 16:25]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then I perceive it is not best to covet things that are now,



<P>but to wait for things to come.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;The first things are but temporal>



<P>INTER.&nbsp; You say the truth:&nbsp; "For the things which are seen

are temporal;



<P>but the things which are not seen are eternal."&nbsp; [2 Cor. 4:18]



<P>But though this be so, yet since things present and our fleshly appetite



<P>are such near neighbours one to another; and again,



<P>because things to come, and carnal sense, are such strangers



<P>one to another; therefore it is, that the first of these so suddenly



<P>fall into amity, and that distance is so continued between the second.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{80}



<P>Then I saw in my dream that the Interpreter took Christian by the hand,



<P>and led him into a place where was a fire burning against a wall,



<P>and one standing by it, always casting much water upon it, to quench

it;



<P>yet did the fire burn higher and hotter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Christian, What means this?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{81}



<P>The Interpreter answered, This fire is the work of grace that is



<P>wrought in the heart; he that casts water upon it, to extinguish



<P>and put it out, is the Devil; but in that thou seest the fire



<P>notwithstanding burn higher and hotter, thou shalt also see



<P>the reason of that.&nbsp; So he had him about to the backside of the

wall,



<P>where he saw a man with a vessel of oil in his hand, of the which



<P>he did also continually cast, but secretly, into the fire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Christian, What means this?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{82}



<P>The Interpreter answered, This is Christ, who continually,



<P>with the oil of his grace, maintains the work already begun



<P>in the heart:&nbsp; by the means of which, notwithstanding what the

devil



<P>can do, the souls of his people prove gracious still.&nbsp; [2 Cor.

12:9]



<P>And in that thou sawest that the man stood behind the wall to maintain



<P>the fire, that is to teach thee that it is hard for the tempted



<P>to see how this work of grace is maintained in the soul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I saw also, that the Interpreter took him again by the hand,



<P>and led him into a pleasant place, where was builded a stately palace,



<P>beautiful to behold; at the sight of which Christian



<P>was greatly delighted.&nbsp; He saw also, upon the top thereof,



<P>certain persons walking, who were clothed all in gold.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Christian, May we go in thither?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{83}



<P>&lt;The valiant man>



<P>Then the Interpreter took him, and led him up towards the door



<P>of the palace; and behold, at the door stood a great company of men,



<P>as desirous to go in; but durst not.&nbsp; There also sat a man



<P>at a little distance from the door, at a table-side, with a book



<P>and his inkhorn before him, to take the name of him that should



<P>enter therein; he saw also, that in the doorway stood many men in armour



<P>to keep it, being resolved to do the men that would enter



<P>what hurt and mischief they could.&nbsp; Now was Christian somewhat

in amaze.



<P>At last, when every man started back for fear of the armed men,



<P>Christian saw a man of a very stout countenance come up to the man



<P>that sat there to write, saying, Set down my name, Sir:&nbsp; the which



<P>when he had done, he saw the man draw his sword, and put a helmet



<P>upon his head, and rush toward the door upon the armed men, who laid



<P>upon him with deadly force; but the man, not at all discouraged,



<P>fell to cutting and hacking most fiercely.&nbsp; So after he had received



<P>and given many wounds to those that attempted to keep him out,



<P>he cut his way through them all [Acts 14:.22], and pressed forward



<P>into the palace, at which there was a pleasant voice heard from those



<P>that were within, even of those that walked upon the top of the palace,



<P>saying--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in, come in;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eternal glory thou shalt win."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So he went in, and was clothed with such garments as they.



<P>Then Christian smiled and said; I think verily I know the meaning



<P>of this.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{84}



<P>&lt;Despair like an iron cage>



<P>Now, said Christian, let me go hence.&nbsp; Nay, stay, said the Interpreter,



<P>till I have shewed thee a little more, and after that thou shalt go



<P>on thy way.&nbsp; So he took him by the hand again, and led him into



<P>a very dark room, where there sat a man in an iron cage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now the man, to look on, seemed very sad; he sat with his eyes



<P>looking down to the ground, his hands folded together,



<P>and he sighed as if he would break his heart.&nbsp; Then said Christian,



<P>What means this?&nbsp; At which the Interpreter bid him talk with the

man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then said Christian to the man, What art thou?&nbsp; The man answered,



<P>I am what I was not once.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{85}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; What wast thou once?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MAN.&nbsp; The man said, I was once a fair and flourishing professor,



<P>both in mine own eyes, and also in the eyes of others; I once was,



<P>as I thought, fair for the Celestial City, and had then even joy



<P>at the thoughts that I should get thither.&nbsp; [Luke 8:13]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, but what art thou now?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MAN.&nbsp; I am now a man of despair, and am shut up in it,



<P>as in this iron cage.&nbsp; I cannot get out.&nbsp; Oh, now I cannot!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But how camest thou in this condition?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MAN.&nbsp; I left off to watch and be sober.&nbsp; I laid the reins,



<P>upon the neck of my lusts; I sinned against the light of the Word



<P>and the goodness of God; I have grieved the Spirit, and he is gone;



<P>I tempted the devil, and he is come to me; I have provoked God to anger,



<P>and he has left me:&nbsp; I have so hardened my heart, that I cannot

repent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{86}



<P>Then said Christian to the Interpreter, But is there no hope for such



<P>a man as this?&nbsp; Ask him, said the Interpreter.&nbsp; Nay, said

Christian,



<P>pray, Sir, do you.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>INTER.&nbsp; Then said the Interpreter, Is there no hope, but you must

be



<P>kept in the iron cage of despair?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MAN.&nbsp; No, none at all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>INTER.&nbsp; Why, the Son of the Blessed is very pitiful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MAN.&nbsp; I have crucified him to myself afresh [Heb. 6:6];



<P>I have despised his person [Luke 19:14]; I have despised



<P>his righteousness; I have "counted his blood an unholy thing";



<P>I have "done despite to the Spirit of grace".&nbsp; [Heb. 10:28-29]



<P>Therefore I have shut myself out of all the promises,



<P>and there now remains to me nothing but threatenings,



<P>dreadful threatenings, fearful threatenings, of certain judgement



<P>and fiery indignation, which shall devour me as an adversary.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{87}



<P>INTER.&nbsp; For what did you bring yourself into this condition?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MAN.&nbsp; For the lusts, pleasures, and profits of this world;



<P>in the enjoyment of which I did then promise myself much delight;



<P>but now every one of those things also bite me, and gnaw me



<P>like a burning worm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>INTER.&nbsp; But canst thou not now repent and turn?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{88}



<P>MAN.&nbsp; God hath denied me repentance.&nbsp; His Word gives me no

encouragement



<P>to believe; yea, himself hath shut me up in this iron cage;



<P>nor can all the men in the world let me out.&nbsp; O eternity, eternity!



<P>how shall I grapple with the misery that I must meet with in eternity!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>INTER.&nbsp; Then said the Interpreter to Christian, Let this man's

misery



<P>be remembered by thee, and be an everlasting caution to thee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, said Christian, this is fearful!&nbsp; God help me

to watch and



<P>be sober, and to pray that I may shun the cause of this man's misery!



<P>Sir, is it not time for me to go on my way now?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>INTER.&nbsp; Tarry till I shall show thee one thing more, and then thou

shalt



<P>go on thy way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{89}



<P>So he took Christian by the hand again, and led him into a chamber,



<P>where there was one rising out of bed; and as he put on his raiment,



<P>he shook and trembled.&nbsp; Then said Christian, Why doth this man



<P>thus tremble?&nbsp; The Interpreter then bid him tell to Christian



<P>the reason of his so doing.&nbsp; So he began and said, This night,



<P>as I was in my sleep, I dreamed, and behold the heavens grew



<P>exceeding black; also it thundered and lightened in most fearful wise,



<P>that it put me into an agony; so I looked up in my dream,



<P>and saw the clouds rack at an unusual rate, upon which I heard



<P>a great sound of a trumpet, and saw also a man sit upon a cloud,



<P>attended with the thousands of heaven; they were all in flaming fire:



<P>also the heavens were in a burning flame.&nbsp; I heard then a voice

saying,



<P>"Arise, ye dead, and come to judgement"; and with that the rocks rent,



<P>the graves opened, and the dead that were therein came forth.



<P>Some of them were exceeding glad, and looked upward; and some sought



<P>to hide themselves under the mountains.&nbsp; [1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes.

4:16;



<P>Jude 14; John 5:28,29; 2 Thes. 1:7,8; Rev. 20:11-14; Isa. 26:21;



<P>Micah 7:16,17; Ps. 95:1-3;&nbsp; Dan. 7:10]&nbsp; Then I saw the man



<P>that sat upon the cloud open the book, and bid the world draw near.



<P>Yet there was, by reason of a fierce flame which issued out



<P>and came from before him, a convenient distance betwixt him and them,



<P>as betwixt the judge and the prisoners at the bar.&nbsp; [Mal. 3:2,3;



<P>Dan. 7:9,10]&nbsp; I heard it also proclaimed to them that attended

on



<P>the man that sat on the cloud, Gather together the tares, the chaff,



<P>and stubble, and cast them into the burning lake.&nbsp; [Matt. 3:12;

13:30;



<P>Mal. 4:1]&nbsp; And with that, the bottomless pit opened, just whereabout



<P>I stood; out of the mouth of which there came, in an abundant manner,



<P>smoke and coals of fire, with hideous noises.&nbsp; It was also said



<P>to the same persons, "Gather my wheat into the garner."&nbsp; [Luke

3:17]



<P>And with that I saw many catched up and carried away into the clouds,



<P>but I was left behind.&nbsp; [1 Thes. 4:16,17]&nbsp; I also sought to

hide myself,



<P>but I could not, for the man that sat upon the cloud still kept his

eye



<P>upon me; my sins also came into my mind; and my conscience did accuse

me



<P>on every side.&nbsp; [Rom. 3:14,15]&nbsp; Upon this I awaked from my

sleep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{90}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But what is it that made you so afraid of this sight?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MAN.&nbsp; Why, I thought that the day of judgement was come,



<P>and that I was not ready for it:&nbsp; but this frighted me most,



<P>that the angels gathered up several, and left me behind;



<P>also the pit of hell opened her mouth just where I stood.



<P>My conscience, too, afflicted me; and, as I thought, the Judge



<P>had always his eye upon me, shewing indignation in his countenance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{91}



<P>Then said the Interpreter to Christian, Hast thou considered



<P>all these things?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, and they put me in hope and fear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>INTER.&nbsp; Well, keep all things so in thy mind that they may be as

a goad



<P>in thy sides, to prick thee forward in the way thou must go.



<P>Then Christian began to gird up his loins, and to address himself



<P>to his journey.&nbsp; Then said the Interpreter, The Comforter be always



<P>with thee, good Christian, to guide thee in the way that leads



<P>to the City.&nbsp; So Christian went on his way, saying--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here I have seen things rare and profitable;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things pleasant, dreadful, things to make me

stable



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what I have begun to take in hand;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then let me think on them, and understand



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore they showed me were, and let me be



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thankful, O good Interpreter, to thee."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{92}



<P>Now I saw in my dream, that the highway up which Christian was to go,



<P>was fenced on either side with a wall, and that wall



<P>was called Salvation.&nbsp; [Isa. 26:1]&nbsp; Up this way, therefore,



<P>did burdened Christian run, but not without great difficulty,



<P>because of the load on his back.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{93}



<P>He ran thus till he came at a place somewhat ascending,



<P>and upon that place stood a cross, and a little below, in the bottom,



<P>a sepulchre.&nbsp; So I saw in my dream, that just as Christian came

up



<P>with the cross, his burden loosed from off his shoulders,



<P>and fell from off his back, and began to tumble, and so continued to

do,



<P>till it came to the mouth of the sepulchre, where it fell in,



<P>and I saw it no more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{94}



<P>&lt;When God Releases us of our guilt and burden we are as those



<P>that leap for joy>



<P>Then was Christian glad and lightsome, and said, with a merry heart,



<P>"He hath given me rest by his sorrow, and life by his death."



<P>Then he stood still awhile to look and wonder; for it was



<P>very surprising to him, that the sight of the cross should thus



<P>ease him of his burden.&nbsp; He looked therefore, and looked again,



<P>even till the springs that were in his head sent the waters down



<P>his cheeks.&nbsp; [Zech. 12:10]&nbsp; Now, as he stood looking and weeping,



<P>behold three Shining Ones came to him and saluted him with



<P>"Peace be unto thee".&nbsp; So the first said to him, "Thy sins be



<P>forgiven thee" [Mark 2:5]; the second stripped him of his rags,



<P>and clothed him with change of raiment [Zech. 3:4]; the third also



<P>set a mark on his forehead, and gave him a roll with a seal upon it,



<P>which he bade him look on as he ran, and that he should give it in



<P>at the Celestial Gate.&nbsp; [Eph. 1:13]&nbsp; So they went their way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who's this? the Pilgrim.&nbsp; How! 'tis very

true,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old things are past away, all's become new.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange! he's another man, upon my word,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They be fine feathers that make a fine bird.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;A Christian can sing though alone, when God doth give him



<P>the joy of his heart>



<P>Then Christian gave three leaps for joy, and went on singing--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thus far I did come laden with my sin;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor could aught ease the grief that I was in



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till I came hither:&nbsp; What a place is this!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must here be the beginning of my bliss?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must here the burden fall from off my back?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must here the strings that bound it to me crack?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blest cross! blest sepulchre! blest rather

be



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Man that there was put to shame for me!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{95}



<P>&lt;Simple, Sloth, and Presumption>



<P>I saw then in my dream, that he went on thus, even until



<P>he came at a bottom, where he saw, a little out of the way,



<P>three men fast asleep, with fetters upon their heels.&nbsp; The name

of



<P>the one was Simple, another Sloth, and the third Presumption.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{96}



<P>Christian then seeing them lie in this case went to them,



<P>if peradventure he might awake them, and cried, You are like them



<P>that sleep on the top of a mast, for the Dead Sea is under you--



<P>a gulf that hath no bottom.&nbsp; [Prov. 23:34]&nbsp; Awake, therefore,



<P>and come away; be willing also, and I will help you off with your irons.



<P>He also told them, If he that "goeth about like a roaring lion"



<P>comes by, you will certainly become a prey to his teeth.&nbsp; [1 Pet.

5:8]



<P>&lt;There is no persuasion will do, if God openeth not the eyes>



<P>With that they looked upon him, and began to reply in this sort:



<P>Simple said, "I see no danger"; Sloth said, "Yet a little more sleep";



<P>and Presumption said, "Every fat must stand upon its own bottom;



<P>what is the answer else that I should give thee?"&nbsp; And so they

lay down



<P>to sleep again, and Christian went on his way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{97}



<P>Yet was he troubled to think that men in that danger should so



<P>little esteem the kindness of him that so freely offered to help them,



<P>both by awakening of them, counselling of them, and proffering



<P>to help them off with their irons.&nbsp; And as he was troubled thereabout,



<P>he espied two men come tumbling over the wall on the left hand



<P>of the narrow way; and they made up apace to him.&nbsp; The name of

the one



<P>was Formalist, and the name of the other Hypocrisy.&nbsp; So, as I said,



<P>they drew up unto him, who thus entered with them into discourse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{98}



<P>&lt;Christian talked with them>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Gentlemen, whence came you, and whither go you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FORM. and HYP.&nbsp; We were born in the land of Vain-glory,



<P>and are going for praise to Mount Zion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why came you not in at the gate which standeth at



<P>the beginning of the way?&nbsp; Know you not that it is written,



<P>that he that cometh not in by the door, "but climbeth up some other

way,



<P>the same is a thief and a robber?"&nbsp; [John 10:1]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FORM. and HYP.&nbsp; They said, That to go to the gate for entrance

was,



<P>by all their countrymen, counted too far about; and that, therefore,



<P>their usual way was to make a short cut of it, and to climb over



<P>the wall, as they had done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But will it not be counted a trespass against the Lord of

the city



<P>whither we are bound, thus to violate his revealed will?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{99}



<P>&lt;They that come into the way, but not by the door,



<P>think that they can say something in vindication of their own practice>



<P>FORM. and HYP.&nbsp; They told him, that, as for that, he needed not



<P>to trouble his head thereabout; for what they did they had custom for;



<P>and could produce, if need were, testimony that would witness it



<P>for more than a thousand years.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But, said Christian, will your practice stand a trial at

law?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FORM. and HYP.&nbsp; They told him, That custom, it being of



<P>so long a standing as above a thousand years, would, doubtless,



<P>now be admitted as a thing legal by any impartial judge; and besides,



<P>said they, if we get into the way, what's matter which way we get in?



<P>if we are in, we are in; thou art but in the way, who, as we perceive,



<P>came in at the gate; and we are also in the way, that came tumbling



<P>over the wall; wherein, now, is thy condition better than ours?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I walk by the rule of my Master; you walk by the rude working



<P>of your fancies.&nbsp; You are counted thieves already, by the Lord



<P>of the way; therefore, I doubt you will not be found true men at



<P>the end of the way.&nbsp; You come in by yourselves, without his direction;



<P>and shall go out by yourselves, without his mercy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{100}



<P>To this they made him but little answer; only they bid him



<P>look to himself.&nbsp; Then I saw that they went on every man in his

way



<P>without much conference one with another, save that these two men



<P>told Christian, that as to laws and ordinances, they doubted not



<P>but they should as conscientiously do them as he; therefore, said they,



<P>we see not wherein thou differest from us but by the coat that is on



<P>thy back, which was, as we trow, given thee by some of thy neighbours,



<P>to hide the shame of thy nakedness.

<P>{101}



<P>&lt;Christian has got his Lord's coat on his back, and is



<P>comforted therewith; he is comforted, also, with his mark and his roll>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; By laws and ordinances you will not be saved, since you



<P>came not in by the door.&nbsp; [Gal. 2:16]&nbsp; And as for this coat

that is on



<P>my back, it was given me by the Lord of the place whither I go;



<P>and that, as you say, to cover my nakedness with.&nbsp; And I take it

as



<P>a token of his kindness to me; for I had nothing but rags before.



<P>And besides, thus I comfort myself as I go:&nbsp; Surely, think I,



<P>when I come to the gate of the city, the Lord thereof will know me



<P>for good since I have this coat on my back--a coat that he gave me



<P>freely in the day that he stripped me of my rags.&nbsp; I have, moreover,



<P>a mark in my forehead, of which, perhaps, you have taken no notice,



<P>which one of my Lord's most intimate associates fixed there in the day



<P>that my burden fell off my shoulders.&nbsp; I will tell you, moreover,



<P>that I had then given me a roll, sealed, to comfort me by reading



<P>as I go on the way; I was also bid to give it in at the Celestial Gate,



<P>in token of my certain going in after it; all which things, I doubt,



<P>you want, and want them because you came not in at the gate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{102}



<P>&lt;Christian has talk with himself>



<P>To these things they gave him no answer; only they looked upon



<P>each other, and laughed.&nbsp; Then, I saw that they went on all,



<P>save that Christian kept before, who had no more talk but with himself,



<P>and that sometimes sighingly, and sometimes comfortably;



<P>also he would be often reading in the roll that one of the Shining Ones



<P>gave him, by which he was refreshed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{103}



<P>&lt;He comes to the Hill Difficulty>



<P>I beheld, then, that they all went on till they came to the foot



<P>of the Hill Difficulty; at the bottom of which was a spring.



<P>There were also in the same place two other ways besides that



<P>which came straight from the gate; one turned to the left hand,



<P>and the other to the right, at the bottom of the hill;



<P>but the narrow way lay right up the hill, and the name of the going

up



<P>the side of the hill is called Difficulty.&nbsp; Christian now went



<P>to the spring, and drank thereof, to refresh himself [Isa. 49:10],



<P>and then began to go up the hill, saying--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The hill, though high, I covet to ascend,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulty will not me offend;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I perceive the way to life lies here.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, pluck up heart, let's neither faint nor

fear;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better, though difficult, the right way to

go,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than wrong, though easy, where the end is woe."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{104}



<P>&lt;The danger of turning out of the way>



<P>The other two also came to the foot of the hill; but when they saw



<P>that the hill was steep and high, and that there were two other ways



<P>to go, and supposing also that these two ways might meet again,



<P>with that up which Christian went, on the other side of the hill,



<P>therefore they were resolved to go in those ways.&nbsp; Now the name

of one



<P>of these ways was Danger, and the name of the other Destruction.



<P>So the one took the way which is called Danger, which led him into



<P>a great wood, and the other took directly up the way to Destruction,



<P>which led him into a wide field, full of dark mountains,



<P>where he stumbled and fell, and rose no more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shall they who wrong begin yet rightly end?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall they at all have safety for their friend?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, no; in headstrong manner they set out,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And headlong will they fall at last no doubt."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{105}



<P>&lt;A ward of grace>



<P>I looked, then, after Christian, to see him go up the hill,



<P>where I perceived he fell from running to going, and from going



<P>to clambering upon his hands and his knees, because of the steepness



<P>of the place.&nbsp; Now, about the midway to the top of the hill



<P>was a pleasant arbour, made by the Lord of the hill for the refreshing



<P>of weary travellers; thither, therefore, Christian got, where also



<P>he sat down to rest him.&nbsp; Then he pulled his roll out of his bosom,



<P>and read therein to his comfort; he also now began afresh to take



<P>a review of the coat or garment that was given him as he stood



<P>by the cross.&nbsp; Thus pleasing himself awhile, he at last fell



<P>into a slumber, and thence into a fast sleep, which detained him



<P>in that place until it was almost night; and in his sleep,



<P>his roll fell out of his hand.&nbsp; &lt;He that sleeps is a loser>



<P>Now, as he was sleeping, there came one to him, and awaked him, saying,



<P>Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise.



<P>[Prov. 6:6]&nbsp; And with that Christian started up, and sped him on



<P>his way, and went apace, till he came to the top of the hill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{106}



<P>&lt;Christian meets with Mistrust and Timorous>



<P>Now, when he was got up to the top of the hill, there came two men



<P>running to meet him amain; the name of the one was Timorous,



<P>and of the other, Mistrust; to whom Christian said, Sirs,



<P>what's the matter?&nbsp; You run the wrong way.&nbsp; Timorous answered,



<P>that they were going to the City of Zion, and had got up



<P>that difficult place; but, said he, the further we go, the more danger



<P>we meet with; wherefore we turned, and are going back again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Yes, said Mistrust, for just before us lie a couple of lions in the

way,



<P>whether sleeping or waking we know not, and we could not think,



<P>if we came within reach, but they would presently pull us in pieces.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{107}



<P>&lt;Christian shakes off fear>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then said Christian, You make me afraid, but whither shall

I fly



<P>to be safe?&nbsp; If I go back to mine own country, that is prepared



<P>for fire and brimstone, and I shall certainly perish there.



<P>If I can get to the Celestial City, I am sure to be in safety there.



<P>I must venture.&nbsp; To go back is nothing but death; to go forward



<P>is fear of death, and life-everlasting beyond it.&nbsp; I will yet



<P>go forward.&nbsp; So Mistrust and Timorous ran down the hill,



<P>and Christian went on his way.&nbsp; &lt;Christian missed his roll



<P>wherein he used to take comfort>&nbsp; But, thinking again of what



<P>he had heard from the men, he felt in his bosom for his roll,



<P>that he might read therein, and be comforted; but he felt,



<P>and found it not.&nbsp; Then was Christian in great distress,



<P>and knew not what to do; for he wanted that which used to relieve him,



<P>and that which should have been his pass into the Celestial City.



<P>&lt;He is perplexed for his roll>&nbsp; Here, therefore, he begun to

be



<P>much perplexed, and knew not what to do.&nbsp; At last he bethought

himself



<P>that he had slept in the arbour that is on the side of the hill;



<P>and, falling down upon his knees, he asked God's forgiveness for that



<P>his foolish act, and then went back to look for his roll.



<P>But all the way he went back, who can sufficiently set forth the sorrow



<P>of Christian's heart?&nbsp; Sometimes he sighed, sometimes he wept,



<P>and oftentimes he chid himself for being so foolish to fall asleep



<P>in that place, which was erected only for a little refreshment



<P>for his weariness.&nbsp; Thus, therefore, he went back, carefully looking



<P>on this side and on that, all the way as he went, if happily he might



<P>find his roll, that had been his comfort so many times in his journey.



<P>He went thus, till he came again within sight of the arbour



<P>where he sat and slept; but that sight renewed his sorrow the more,



<P>by bringing again, even afresh, his evil of sleeping into his mind.



<P>[Rev. 2:5; 1 Thes. 5:7,8]&nbsp; &lt;Christian bewails his foolish sleeping>



<P>Thus, therefore, he now went on bewailing his sinful sleep, saying,



<P>O wretched man that I am that I should sleep in the day-time!



<P>that I should sleep in the midst of difficulty! that I should



<P>so indulge the flesh, as to use that rest for ease to my flesh,



<P>which the Lord of the hill hath erected only for the relief



<P>of the spirits of pilgrims!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{108}



<P>How many steps have I took in vain! Thus it happened to Israel,



<P>for their sin; they were sent back again by the way of the Red Sea;



<P>and I am made to tread those steps with sorrow, which I might have trod



<P>with delight, had it not been for this sinful sleep.&nbsp; How far might

I



<P>have been on my way by this time!&nbsp; I am made to tread those steps



<P>thrice over, which I needed not to have trod but once; yea,



<P>now also I am like to be benighted, for the day is almost spent.



<P>O, that I had not slept!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{109}



<P>&lt;Christian findeth his roll where he lost it>



<P>Now, by this time he was come to the arbour again, where for a while



<P>he sat down and wept; but at last, as Christian would have it,



<P>looking sorrowfully down under the settle, there he espied his roll;



<P>the which he, with trembling and haste, catched up, and put it into



<P>his bosom.&nbsp; But who can tell how joyful this man was when he had

gotten



<P>his roll again! for this roll was the assurance of his life



<P>and acceptance at the desired haven.&nbsp; Therefore he laid it up



<P>in his bosom, gave thanks to God for directing his eye to the place



<P>where it lay, and with joy and tears betook himself again



<P>to his journey.&nbsp; But oh, how nimbly now did he go up the rest



<P>of the hill!&nbsp; Yet, before he got up, the sun went down upon Christian;



<P>and this made him again recall the vanity of his sleeping



<P>to his remembrance; and thus he again began to condole with himself:



<P>O thou sinful sleep; how, for thy sake, am I like to be benighted



<P>in my journey!&nbsp; I must walk without the sun; darkness must cover



<P>the path of my feet; and I must hear the noise of the doleful creatures,



<P>because of my sinful sleep.&nbsp; [1 Thes. 5:6,7]&nbsp; Now also he

remembered



<P>the story that Mistrust and Timorous told him of; how they were frighted



<P>with the sight of the lions.&nbsp; Then said Christian to himself again,



<P>These beasts range in the night for their prey; and if they should



<P>meet with me in the dark, how should I shift them?&nbsp; How should

I escape



<P>being by them torn in pieces?&nbsp; Thus he went on his way.



<P>But while he was thus bewailing his unhappy miscarriage,



<P>he lift up his eyes, and behold there was a very stately palace



<P>before him, the name of which was Beautiful; and it stood just by



<P>the highway side.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{110}



<P>So I saw in my dream that he made haste and went forward,



<P>that if possible he might get lodging there.&nbsp; Now, before he had



<P>gone far, he entered into a very narrow passage, which was about



<P>a furlong off the porter's lodge; and looking very narrowly before him



<P>as he went, he espied two lions in the way.&nbsp; Now, thought he,



<P>I see the dangers that Mistrust and Timorous were driven back by.



<P>(The lions were chained, but he saw not the chains.)



<P>Then he was afraid, and thought also himself to go back after them,



<P>for he thought nothing but death was before him.&nbsp; But the porter



<P>at the lodge, whose name is Watchful, perceiving that Christian



<P>made a halt as if he would go back, cried unto him, saying,



<P>Is thy strength so small?&nbsp; [Mark 8:34-37]&nbsp; Fear not the lions,



<P>for they are chained, and are placed there for trial of faith



<P>where it is, and for discovery of those that had none.



<P>Keep in the midst of the path, no hurt shall come unto thee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Difficulty is behind, Fear is before,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though he's got on the hill, the lions roar;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Christian man is never long at ease,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When one fright's gone, another doth him seize."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{111}



<P>Then I saw that he went on, trembling for fear of the lions,



<P>but taking good heed to the directions of the porter;



<P>he heard them roar, but they did him no harm.&nbsp; Then he clapped



<P>his hands, and went on till he came and stood before the gate



<P>where the porter was.&nbsp; Then said Christian to the porter,



<P>Sir, what house is this?&nbsp; And may I lodge here to-night?



<P>The porter answered, This house was built by the Lord of the hill,



<P>and he built it for the relief and security of pilgrims.



<P>The porter also asked whence he was, and whither he was going.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{112}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I am come from the City of Destruction, and am going



<P>to Mount Zion; but because the sun is now set, I desire, if I may,



<P>to lodge here to-night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>POR.&nbsp; What is your name?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; My name is now Christian, but my name at the first was Graceless;



<P>I came of the race of Japheth, whom God will persuade to dwell



<P>in the tents of Shem.&nbsp; [Gen. 9:27]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>POR.&nbsp; But how doth it happen that you come so late?&nbsp; The sun

is set.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{113}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I had been here sooner, but that, "wretched man that I am!"



<P>I slept in the arbour that stands on the hillside; nay, I had,



<P>notwithstanding that, been here much sooner, but that, in my sleep.



<P>I lost my evidence, and came without it to the brow of the hill



<P>and then feeling for it, and finding it not, I was forced



<P>with sorrow of heart, to go back to the place where I slept my sleep,



<P>where I found it, and now I am come.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>POR.&nbsp; Well, I will call out one of the virgins of this place, who

will,



<P>if she likes your talk, bring you into the rest of the family,



<P>according to the rules of the house.&nbsp; So Watchful, the porter,



<P>rang a bell, at the sound of which came out at the door of the house,



<P>a grave and beautiful damsel, named Discretion, and asked why



<P>she was called.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{114}



<P>The porter answered, This man is in a journey from



<P>the City of Destruction to Mount Zion, but being weary and benighted,



<P>he asked me if he might lodge here to-night; so I told him I would call



<P>for thee, who, after discourse had with him, mayest do as seemeth



<P>thee good, even according to the law of the house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{115}



<P>Then she asked him whence he was, and whither he was going,



<P>and he told her.&nbsp; She asked him also how he got into the way;



<P>and he told her.&nbsp; Then she asked him what he had seen and met with



<P>in the way; and he told, her.&nbsp; And last she asked his name; so

he said,



<P>It is Christian, and I have so much the more a desire to lodge



<P>here to-night, because, by what I perceive, this place was built



<P>by the Lord of the hill for the relief and security of pilgrims.



<P>So she smiled, but the water stood in her eyes; and after



<P>a little pause, she said, I will call forth two or three more



<P>of the family.&nbsp; So she ran to the door, and called out Prudence,



<P>Piety, and Charity, who, after a little more discourse with him,



<P>had him into the family; and many of them, meeting him at the threshold



<P>of the house, said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord;



<P>this house was built by the Lord of the hill, on purpose to entertain



<P>such pilgrims in.&nbsp; Then he bowed his head, and followed them



<P>into the house.&nbsp; So when he was come in and sat down, they gave

him



<P>something to drink, and consented together, that until supper was ready,



<P>some of them should have some particular discourse with Christian,



<P>for the best improvement of time; and they appointed Piety,



<P>and Prudence, and Charity to discourse with him; and thus they began:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{116}



<P>&lt;Piety discourses him>



<P>PIETY.&nbsp; Come, good Christian, since we have been so loving to you,



<P>to receive you in our house this night, let us, if perhaps we may



<P>better ourselves thereby, talk with you of all things



<P>that have happened to you in your pilgrimage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; With a very good will, and I am glad that you are



<P>so well disposed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{117}



<P>PIETY.&nbsp; What moved you at first to betake yourself to a pilgrim's

life?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;How Christian was driven out of his own country>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I was driven out of my native country by a dreadful sound



<P>that was in mine ears:&nbsp; to wit, that unavoidable destruction



<P>did attend me, if I abode in that place where I was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PIETY.&nbsp; But how did it happen that you came out of your country



<P>this way?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;How he got into the way to Zion>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; It was as God would have it; for when I was under the fears



<P>of destruction, I did not know whither to go; but by chance



<P>there came a man, even to me, as I was trembling and weeping,



<P>whose name is Evangelist, and he directed me to the wicket-gate,



<P>which else I should never have found, and so set me into the way



<P>that hath led me directly to this house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{118}



<P>PIETY.&nbsp; But did you not come by the house of the Interpreter?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;A rehearsal of what he saw in the way>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, and did see such things there, the remembrance of which



<P>will stick by me as long as I live; especially three things:&nbsp; to

wit,



<P>how Christ, in despite of Satan, maintains his work of grace



<P>in the heart; how the man had sinned himself quite out of hopes



<P>of God's mercy; and also the dream of him that thought in his sleep



<P>the day of judgement was come.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PIETY.&nbsp; Why, did you hear him tell his dream?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, and a dreadful one it was.&nbsp; I thought it made my

heart ache



<P>as he was telling of it; but yet I am glad I heard it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{119}



<P>PIETY.&nbsp; Was that all that you saw at the house of the Interpreter?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; No; he took me and had me where he shewed me a stately palace,



<P>and how the people were clad in gold that were in it; and how



<P>there came a venturous man and cut his way through the armed men



<P>that stood in the door to keep him out, and how he was bid to come in,



<P>and win eternal glory.&nbsp; Methought those things did ravish my heart!



<P>I would have stayed at that good man's house a twelvemonth,



<P>but that I knew I had further to go.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{120}



<P>PIETY.&nbsp; And what saw you else in the way?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Saw! why, I went but a little further, and I saw one,



<P>as I thought in my mind, hang bleeding upon the tree;



<P>and the very sight of him made my burden fall off my back,



<P>(for I groaned under a very heavy burden,) but then it fell down



<P>from off me.&nbsp; It was a strange thing to me, for I never saw



<P>such a thing before; yea, and while I stood looking up,



<P>for then I could not forbear looking, three Shining Ones came to me.



<P>One of them testified that my sins were forgiven me; another stripped

me



<P>of my rags, and gave me this broidered coat which you see;



<P>and the third set the mark which you see in my forehead, and gave me



<P>this sealed roll.&nbsp; (And with that he plucked it out of his bosom.)

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{121}



<P>PIETY.&nbsp; But you saw more than this, did you not?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; The things that I have told you were the best;



<P>yet some other matters I saw, as, namely--I saw three men,



<P>Simple, Sloth, and Presumption, lie asleep a little out of the way,



<P>as I came, with irons upon their heels; but do you think



<P>I could awake them?&nbsp; I also saw Formality and Hypocrisy come



<P>tumbling over the wall, to go, as they pretended, to Zion,



<P>but they were quickly lost, even as I myself did tell them;



<P>but they would not believe.&nbsp; But above all, I found it hard work



<P>to get up this hill, and as hard to come by the lions' mouths,



<P>and truly if it had not been for the good man, the porter that stands



<P>at the gate, I do not know but that after all I might have



<P>gone back again; but now I thank God I am here, and I thank you



<P>for receiving of me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{122}



<P>Then Prudence thought good to ask him a few questions,



<P>and desired his answer to them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Prudence discourses him>



<P>PRUD.&nbsp; Do you not think sometimes of the country from whence you

came?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Christian's thoughts of his native country>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, but with much shame and detestation:&nbsp; "Truly,



<P>if I had been mindful of that country from whence I came out,



<P>I might have had opportunity to have returned; but now I desire



<P>a better country, that is, an heavenly."&nbsp; [Heb. 11:15,16]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PRUD.&nbsp; Do you not yet bear away with you some of the things



<P>that then you were conversant withal?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Christian distasted with carnal cogitations>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, but greatly against my will; especially my inward



<P>and carnal cogitations, with which all my countrymen, as well as myself,



<P>were delighted; but now all those things are my grief;



<P>and might I but choose mine own things, &lt;Christian's choice>



<P>I would choose never to think of those things more; but when I would



<P>be doing of that which is best, that which is worst is with me.



<P>[Rom 7:16-19]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{123}



<P>PRUD.&nbsp; Do you not find sometimes, as if those things were vanquished,



<P>which at other times are your perplexity?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Christian's golden hours>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, but that is seldom; but they are to me golden hours



<P>in which such things happen to me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PRUD.&nbsp; Can you remember by what means you find your annoyances,



<P>at times, as if they were vanquished?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;How Christian gets power against his corruptions>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, when I think what I saw at the cross, that will do it;



<P>and when I look upon my broidered coat, that will do it;



<P>also when I look into the roll that I carry in my bosom,



<P>that will do it; and when my thoughts wax warm about whither I am going,



<P>that will do it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{124}



<P>PRUD.&nbsp; And what is it that makes you so desirous to go to Mount

Zion?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Why Christian would be at Mount Zion>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, there I hope to see him alive that did hang dead on

the cross;



<P>and there I hope to be rid of all those things that to this day are

in me



<P>an annoyance to me; there, they say, there is no death; and there I

shall



<P>dwell with such company as I like best.&nbsp; [Isa. 25:8; Rev. 21:4]



<P>For, to tell you truth, I love him, because I was by him eased of



<P>my burden; and I am weary of my inward sickness.&nbsp; I would fain

be where



<P>I shall die no more, and with the company that shall continually cry,



<P>"Holy, Holy, Holy!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{125}



<P>&lt;Charity discourses him>



<P>Then said Charity to Christian, Have you a family?&nbsp; Are you



<P>a married man?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I have a wife and four small children.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHAR.&nbsp; And why did you not bring them along with you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Christian's love to his wife and children>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Then Christian wept, and said, Oh, how willingly



<P>would I have done it! but they were all of them utterly averse



<P>to my going on pilgrimage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHAR.&nbsp; But you should have talked to them, and have endeavoured



<P>to have shown them the danger of being behind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; So I did; and told them also of what God had shown to me



<P>of the destruction of our city; "but I seemed to them as one



<P>that mocked", and they believed me not.&nbsp; [Gen. 19:14]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHAR.&nbsp; And did you pray to God that he would bless your counsel

to them?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, and that with much affection:&nbsp; for you must think



<P>that my wife and poor children were very dear unto me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHAR.&nbsp; But did you tell them of your own sorrow, and fear



<P>of destruction? for I suppose that destruction was visible enough



<P>to you.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Christian's fears of perishing might be read in his very countenance>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, over, and over, and over.&nbsp; They might also see

my fears



<P>in my countenance, in my tears, and also in my trembling under



<P>the apprehension of the judgement that did hang over our heads;



<P>but all was not sufficient to prevail with them to come with me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHAR.&nbsp; But what could they say for themselves, why they came not?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{126}



<P>&lt;The cause why his wife and children did not go with him>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, my wife was afraid of losing this world, and my children



<P>were given to the foolish delights of youth:&nbsp; so what by one thing,



<P>and what by another, they left me to wander in this manner alone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHAR.&nbsp; But did you not, with your vain life, damp all that you



<P>by words used by way of persuasion to bring them away with you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{127}



<P>&lt;Christian's good conversation before his wife and children>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Indeed, I cannot commend my life; for I am conscious to myself



<P>of many failings therein; I know also that a man by his conversation



<P>may soon overthrow what by argument or persuasion he doth labour



<P>to fasten upon others for their good.&nbsp; Yet this I can say,



<P>I was very wary of giving them occasion, by any unseemly action,



<P>to make them averse to going on pilgrimage.&nbsp; Yea, for this very

thing



<P>they would tell me I was too precise, and that I denied myself



<P>of things, for their sakes, in which they saw no evil.&nbsp; Nay,



<P>I think I may say, that if what they saw in me did hinder them,



<P>it was my great tenderness in sinning against God, or of doing



<P>any wrong to my neighbour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Christian clear of their blood if they perish>



<P>CHAR.&nbsp; Indeed Cain hated his brother, "because his own works were

evil,



<P>and his brother's righteous" [1 John 3:12]; and if thy wife and children



<P>have been offended with thee for this, they thereby show themselves



<P>to be implacable to good, and "thou hast delivered thy soul



<P>from their blood".&nbsp; [Ezek. 3:19]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{128}



<P>&lt;What Christian had to his supper>



<P>Now I saw in my dream, that thus they sat talking together



<P>until supper was ready.&nbsp; So when they had made ready,



<P>they sat down to meat.&nbsp; &lt;Their talk at supper time>&nbsp; Now

the table



<P>was furnished "with fat things, and with wine that was well refined":



<P>and all their talk at the table was about the Lord of the hill;



<P>as, namely, about what he had done, and wherefore he did what he did,



<P>and why he had builded that house.&nbsp; And by what they said,



<P>I perceived that he had been a great warrior, and had fought with



<P>and slain "him that had the Power of death", but not without



<P>great danger to himself, which made me love him the more.



<P>[Heb. 2:14,15]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{129}



<P>For, as they said, and as I believe (said Christian), he did it with



<P>the loss of much blood; but that which put glory of grace



<P>into all he did, was, that he did it out of pure love to his country.



<P>And besides, there were some of them of the household that said



<P>they had been and spoke with him since he did die on the cross;



<P>and they have attested that they had it from his own lips,



<P>that he is such a lover of poor pilgrims, that the like is not



<P>to be found from the east to the west.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{130}



<P>&lt;Christ makes princes of beggars>



<P>They, moreover, gave an instance of what they affirmed, and that was,



<P>he had stripped himself of his glory, that he might do this



<P>for the poor; and that they heard him say and affirm,



<P>"that he would not dwell in the mountain of Zion alone."



<P>They said, moreover, that he had made many pilgrims princes,



<P>though by nature they were beggars born, and their original



<P>had been the dunghill.&nbsp; [1 Sam 2:8; Ps. 113:7]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{131}



<P>&lt;Christian's bedchamber>



<P>Thus they discoursed together till late at night; and after



<P>they had committed themselves to their Lord for protection,



<P>they betook themselves to rest:&nbsp; the Pilgrim they laid



<P>in a large upper chamber, whose window opened towards the sun-rising:



<P>the name of the chamber was Peace; where he slept till break of day,



<P>and then he awoke and sang--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where am I now?&nbsp; Is this the love and

care



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Jesus for the men that pilgrims are?



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus to provide! that I should be forgiven!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And dwell already the next door to heaven!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{132}



<P>&lt;Christian had into the study, and what he saw there>



<P>So in the morning they all got up; and, after some more discourse,



<P>they told him that he should not depart till they had shown him



<P>the rarities of that place.&nbsp; And first they had him into the study,



<P>where they showed him records of the greatest antiquity; in which,



<P>as I remember my dream, they showed him first the pedigree of the Lord



<P>of the hill, that he was the son of the Ancient of Days, and came by



<P>that eternal generation.&nbsp; Here also was more fully recorded the

acts



<P>that he had done, and the names of many hundreds that he had taken



<P>into his service; and how he had placed them in such habitations that



<P>could neither by length of days, nor decays of nature, be dissolved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{133}



<P>Then they read to him some of the worthy acts that some of his servants



<P>had done:&nbsp; as, how they had "subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,



<P>obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence



<P>of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness



<P>were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, and turned to flight



<P>the armies of the aliens."&nbsp; [Heb 11:33,34]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{134}



<P>They then read again, in another part of the records of the house,



<P>where it was shewed how willing their Lord was to receive



<P>into his favour any, even any, though they in time past had offered



<P>great affronts to his person and proceedings.&nbsp; Here also were



<P>several other histories of many other famous things, of all which



<P>Christian had a view; as of things both ancient and modern;



<P>together with prophecies and predictions of things that have



<P>their certain accomplishment, both to the dread and amazement



<P>of enemies, and the comfort and solace of pilgrims.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{135}



<P>&lt;Christian had into the armoury>



<P>The next day they took him and had him into the armoury,



<P>where they showed him all manner of furniture, which their Lord



<P>had provided for pilgrims, as sword, shield, helmet, breastplate,



<P>ALL-PRAYER, and shoes that would not wear out.&nbsp; And there was here



<P>enough of this to harness out as many men for the service of their Lord



<P>as there be stars in the heaven for multitude.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{136}



<P>&lt;Christian is made to see ancient things>



<P>They also showed him some of the engines with which some of his servants



<P>had done wonderful things.&nbsp; They shewed him Moses' rod;



<P>the hammer and nail with which Jael slew Sisera; the pitchers, trumpets,



<P>and lamps too, with which Gideon put to flight the armies of Midian.



<P>Then they showed him the ox's goad wherewith Shamgar slew



<P>six hundred men.&nbsp; They showed him also the jaw-bone with which

Samson



<P>did such mighty feats.&nbsp; They showed him, moreover, the sling and

stone



<P>with which David slew Goliath of Gath; and the sword, also,



<P>with which their Lord will kill the Man of Sin, in the day



<P>that he shall rise up to the prey.&nbsp; They showed him, besides,



<P>many excellent things, with which Christian was much delighted.



<P>This done, they went to their rest again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{137}



<P>&lt;Christian showed the Delectable Mountains>



<P>Then I saw in my dream, that on the morrow he got up to go forward;



<P>but they desired him to stay till the next day also;



<P>and then, said they, we will, if the day be clear, show you



<P>the Delectable Mountains, which, they said, would yet further add



<P>to his comfort, because they were nearer the desired haven



<P>than the place where at present he was; so he consented and stayed.



<P>When the morning was up, they had him to the top of the house,



<P>and bid him look south; so he did:&nbsp; and behold, at a great distance,



<P>he saw a most pleasant mountainous country, beautified with woods,



<P>vineyards, fruits of all sorts, flowers also, with springs



<P>and fountains, very delectable to behold.&nbsp; [Isa. 33:16,17]



<P>Then he asked the name of the country.&nbsp; They said it was



<P>Immanuel's Land; and it is as common, said they, as this hill is,



<P>to and for all the pilgrims.&nbsp; And when thou comest there from thence,



<P>said they, thou mayest see to the gate of the Celestial City,



<P>as the shepherds that live there will make appear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{138}



<P>&lt;Christian sets forward>



<P>Now he bethought himself of setting forward, and they were willing



<P>he should.&nbsp; But first, said they, let us go again into the armoury.



<P>&lt;Christian sent away armed>&nbsp; So they did; and when they came

there,



<P>they harnessed him from head to foot with what was of proof,



<P>lest, perhaps, he should meet with assaults in the way.&nbsp; He being,



<P>therefore, thus accoutred, walketh out with his friends to the gate,



<P>and there he asked the porter if he saw any pilgrims pass by.



<P>Then the porter answered, Yes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{139}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Pray, did you know him? said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>POR.&nbsp; I asked him his name, and he told me it was Faithful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Oh, said Christian, I know him; he is my townsman,



<P>my near neighbour; he comes from the place where I was born.



<P>How far do you think he may be before?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>POR.&nbsp; He is got by this time below the hill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;How Christian and the Porter greet at parting>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Well, said Christian, good Porter, the Lord be with thee,



<P>and add to all thy blessings much increase, for the kindness that thou



<P>hast showed to me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{140}



<P>&lt;The Valley of Humiliation>



<P>Then he began to go forward; but Discretion, Piety, Charity,



<P>and Prudence would accompany him down to the foot of the hill.



<P>So they went on together, reiterating their former discourses,



<P>till they came to go down the hill.&nbsp; Then said Christian,



<P>As it was difficult coming up, so, so far as I can see, it is dangerous



<P>going down.&nbsp; Yes, said Prudence, so it is, for it is a hard matter



<P>for a man to go down into the Valley of Humiliation, as thou art now,



<P>and to catch no slip by the way; therefore, said they, are we come out



<P>to accompany thee down the hill.&nbsp; So he began to go down,



<P>but very warily; yet he caught a slip or two.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{141}



<P>Then I saw in my dream that these good companions, when Christian



<P>was gone to the bottom of the hill, gave him a loaf of bread,



<P>a bottle of wine, and a cluster of raisins; and then he went on his

way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Christian has no armour for his back>



<P>But now, in this Valley of Humiliation, poor Christian was hard put



<P>to it; for he had gone but a little way, before he espied a foul fiend



<P>coming over the field to meet him; his name is Apollyon.



<P>Then did Christian begin to be afraid, and to cast in his mind



<P>whether to go back or to stand his ground.&nbsp; But he considered again



<P>that he had no armour for his back; and therefore thought



<P>that to turn the back to him might give him the greater advantage



<P>with ease to pierce him with his darts.&nbsp; &lt;Christian's resolution



<P>at the approach of Apollyon>&nbsp; Therefore he resolved to venture



<P>and stand his ground; for, thought he, had I no more in mine eye



<P>than the saving of my life, it would be the best way to stand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{142}



<P>So he went on, and Apollyon met him.&nbsp; Now the monster was



<P>hideous to behold; he was clothed with scales, like a fish,



<P>(and they are his pride,) he had wings like a dragon, feet like a bear,



<P>and out of his belly came fire and smoke, and his mouth was as



<P>the mouth of a lion.&nbsp; When he was come up to Christian, he beheld

him



<P>with a disdainful countenance, and thus began to question with him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{143}



<P>APOL.&nbsp; Whence come you? and whither are you bound?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I am come from the City of Destruction, which is the place



<P>of all evil, and am going to the City of Zion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Discourse betwixt Christian and Apollyon>



<P>APOL.&nbsp; By this I perceive thou art one of my subjects,



<P>for all that country is mine, and I am the prince and god of it.



<P>How is it, then, that thou hast run away from thy king?



<P>Were it not that I hope thou mayest do me more service,



<P>I would strike thee now, at one blow, to the ground.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{144}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I was born, indeed, in your dominions, but your service was

hard,



<P>and your wages such as a man could not live on, "for the wages of sin



<P>is death" [Rom 6:23]; therefore, when I was come to years, I did,



<P>as other considerate persons do, look out, if, perhaps,



<P>I might mend myself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Apollyon's flattery>



<P>APOL.&nbsp; There is no prince that will thus lightly lose his subjects,



<P>neither will I as yet lose thee; but since thou complainest



<P>of thy service and wages, be content to go back:&nbsp; what our country



<P>will afford, I do here promise to give thee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; But I have let myself to another, even to the King of princes;



<P>and how can I, with fairness, go back with thee?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{145}



<P>&lt;Apollyon undervalues Christ's service>



<P>APOL.&nbsp; Thou hast done in this, according to the proverb,



<P>"Changed a bad for a worse"; but it is ordinary for those that have



<P>professed themselves his servants, after a while to give him the slip,



<P>and return again to me.&nbsp; Do thou so too, and all shall be well.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I have given him my faith, and sworn my allegiance to him;



<P>how, then, can I go back from this, and not be hanged as a traitor?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Apollyon pretends to be merciful>



<P>APOL.&nbsp; Thou didst the same to me, and yet I am willing to pass

by all,



<P>if now thou wilt yet turn again and go back.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{146}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; What I promised thee was in my nonage; and, besides,



<P>I count the Prince under whose banner now I stand is able to absolve

me;



<P>yea, and to pardon also what I did as to my compliance with thee;



<P>and besides, O thou destroying Apollyon! to speak truth,



<P>I like his service, his wages, his servants, his government,



<P>his company, and country, better than thine; and, therefore,



<P>leave off to persuade me further; I am his servant,



<P>and I will follow him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{147}



<P>&lt;Apollyon pleads the grievous ends of Christians, to dissuade Christian



<P>from persisting in his way>



<P>APOL.&nbsp; Consider, again, when thou art in cool blood,



<P>what thou art like to meet with in the way that thou goest.



<P>Thou knowest that, for the most part, his servants come to an ill end,



<P>because they are transgressors against me and my ways.



<P>How many of them have been put to shameful deaths! and, besides,



<P>thou countest his service better than mine, whereas he never came yet



<P>from the place where he is to deliver any that served him



<P>out of their hands; but as for me, how many times, as all the world



<P>very well knows, have I delivered, either by power, or fraud,



<P>those that have faithfully served me, from him and his,



<P>though taken by them; and so I will deliver thee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; His forbearing at present to deliver them is on purpose



<P>to try their love, whether they will cleave to him to the end;



<P>and as for the ill end thou sayest they come to, that is most glorious



<P>in their account; for, for present deliverance, they do not much



<P>expect it, for they stay for their glory, and then they shall have it



<P>when their Prince comes in his and the glory of the angels.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>APOL.&nbsp; Thou hast already been unfaithful in thy service to him;



<P>and how dost thou think to receive wages of him?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Wherein, O Apollyon! have I been unfaithful to him?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{148}



<P>&lt;Apollyon pleads Christian's infirmities against him>



<P>APOL.&nbsp; Thou didst faint at first setting out, when thou wast



<P>almost choked in the Gulf of Despond; thou didst attempt wrong ways



<P>to be rid of thy burden, whereas thou shouldst have stayed



<P>till thy Prince had taken it off; thou didst sinfully sleep



<P>and lose thy choice thing; thou wast, also, almost persuaded to go back



<P>at the sight of the lions; and when thou talkest of thy journey,



<P>and of what thou hast heard and seen, thou art inwardly desirous



<P>of vain-glory in all that thou sayest or doest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; All this is true, and much more which thou hast left out;



<P>but the Prince whom I serve and honour is merciful,



<P>and ready to forgive; but, besides, these infirmities possessed me



<P>in thy country, for there I sucked them in; and I have groaned



<P>under them, been sorry for them, and have obtained pardon of my Prince.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{149}



<P>&lt;Apollyon in a rage falls upon Christian>



<P>APOL.&nbsp; Then Apollyon broke out into a grievous rage, saying,



<P>I am an enemy to this Prince; I hate his person, his laws, and people;



<P>I am come out on purpose to withstand thee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Apollyon, beware what you do; for I am in the King's highway,



<P>the way of holiness; therefore take heed to yourself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>APOL.&nbsp; Then Apollyon straddled quite over the whole breadth of

the way,



<P>and said, I am void of fear in this matter:&nbsp; prepare thyself to

die;



<P>for I swear by my infernal den, that thou shalt go no further;



<P>here will I spill thy soul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{150}



<P>And with that he threw a flaming dart at his breast; but Christian had



<P>a shield in his hand, with which he caught it, and so prevented



<P>the danger of that.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Christian wounded in his understanding, faith, and conversation>



<P>Then did Christian draw, for he saw it was time to bestir him;



<P>and Apollyon as fast made at him, throwing darts as thick as hail;



<P>by the which, notwithstanding all that Christian could do to avoid it,



<P>Apollyon wounded him in his head, his hand, and foot.



<P>This made Christian give a little back; Apollyon, therefore,



<P>followed his work amain, and Christian again took courage,



<P>and resisted as manfully as he could.&nbsp; This sore combat lasted



<P>for above half a day, even till Christian was almost quite spent;



<P>for you must know that Christian, by reason of his wounds,



<P>must needs grow weaker and weaker.

<P>{10}



<P>As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on



<P>a certain place where was a Den &lt;The Jail/Gaol>, and I laid me down



<P>in that place to sleep:&nbsp; and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream.



<P>I dreamed, and behold, I saw a man clothed with rags,



<P>standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house,



<P>a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back.&nbsp; [Isa. 64:6;



<P>Luke 14:33; Ps. 38:4; Hab. 2:2; Acts 16:30,31]&nbsp; I looked,



<P>and saw him open the book, and read therein; and, as he read,



<P>he wept, and trembled; and, not being able longer to contain,



<P>&lt;His Outcry> he brake out with a lamentable cry, saying,



<P>"What shall I do?"&nbsp; [Acts 2:37]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{11}



<P>In this plight, therefore, he went home and refrained himself



<P>as long as he could, that his wife and children should not perceive



<P>his distress; but he could not be silent long, because that



<P>his trouble increased.&nbsp; Wherefore at length he brake his mind



<P>to his wife and children; and thus he began to talk to them:



<P>O my dear wife, said he, and you the children of my bowels,



<P>I, your dear friend, am in myself undone by reason of a burden



<P>that lieth hard upon me; moreover, I am for certain informed that



<P>this our city &lt;This world> will be burned with fire from heaven;



<P>in which fearful overthrow, both myself, with thee my wife,



<P>and you my sweet babes, shall miserably come to ruin,



<P>except (the which yet I see not) some way of escape can be found,



<P>whereby we may be delivered.&nbsp; &lt;He knows not the way yet/He knows

no way



<P>of escape as of yet>&nbsp; At this his relations were sore amazed;



<P>not for that they believed that what he had said to them was true,



<P>but because they thought that some frenzy distemper had got into



<P>his head; therefore, it drawing towards night, and they hoping



<P>that sleep might settle his brains, with all haste they got him to bed.



<P>But the night was as troublesome to him as the day; wherefore,



<P>instead of sleeping, he spent it in sighs and tears.&nbsp; So,



<P>when the morning was come, they would know how he did.



<P>He told them, Worse and worse:&nbsp; he also set to talking to them

again;



<P>but they began to be hardened.&nbsp; &lt;Carnal physic for a sick soul>



<P>They also thought to drive away his distemper by harsh and surly



<P>carriages to him; sometimes they would deride, sometimes they



<P>would chide, and sometimes they would quite neglect him.



<P>Wherefore he began to retire himself to his chamber, to pray for



<P>and pity them, and also to condole his own misery; he would also



<P>walk solitarily in the fields, sometimes reading, and sometimes praying:



<P>and thus for some days he spent his time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{12}



<P>Now, I saw, upon a time, when he was walking in the fields, that he

was,



<P>as he was wont, reading in his book, and greatly distressed in his mind;



<P>and, as he read, he burst out, as he had done before, crying,



<P>"What shall I do to be saved?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{13}



<P>I saw also that he looked this way and that way, as if he would run;



<P>yet he stood still, because, as I perceived, he could not tell



<P>which way to go.&nbsp; I looked then, and saw a man named Evangelist



<P>coming to him and asked, Wherefore dost thou cry?&nbsp; [Job 33:23]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{14}



<P>He answered, Sir, I perceive by the book in my hand, that I am



<P>condemned to die, and after that to come to judgement [Heb. 9:27];



<P>and I find that I am not willing to do the first [Job 16:21],



<P>nor able to do the second.&nbsp; [Ezek. 22:14]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHRISTIAN no sooner leaves the World but meets



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EVANGELIST, who lovingly him greets



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With tidings of another:&nbsp; and doth show



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Him how to mount to that from this below.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{15}



<P>Then said Evangelist, Why not willing to die, since this life



<P>is attended with so many evils?&nbsp; The man answered, Because I fear



<P>that this burden is upon my back will sink me lower than the grave,



<P>and I shall fall into Tophet.&nbsp; [Isa. 30:33]&nbsp; And, Sir, if

I be not fit



<P>to go to prison, I am not fit, I am sure, to go to judgement,



<P>and from thence to execution; and the thoughts of these things



<P>make me cry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{16}



<P>&lt;Conviction of the necessity of flying>



<P>Then said Evangelist, If this be thy condition, why standest thou still?



<P>He answered, Because I know not whither to go.&nbsp; Then he gave him



<P>a parchment roll, and there was written within, Flee from the wrath



<P>to come.&nbsp; [Matt. 3.7]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{17}



<P>The man therefore read it, and looking upon Evangelist very carefully,



<P>said, Whither must I fly?&nbsp; Then said Evangelist, pointing with



<P>his finger over a very wide field, Do you see yonder wicket-gate?



<P>[Matt. 7:13,14]&nbsp; &lt;Christ, and the way to Him cannot be found



<P>without the Word>&nbsp; The man said, No.&nbsp; Then said the other,



<P>Do you see yonder shining light?&nbsp; [Ps. 119:105; 2 Pet. 1:19]&nbsp;

He said,



<P>I think I do.&nbsp; Then said Evangelist, Keep that light in your eye,



<P>and go up directly thereto:&nbsp; so shalt thou see the gate; at which,



<P>when thou knockest, it shall be told thee what thou shalt do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{18}



<P>So I saw in my dream that the man began to run.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, he had not run far from his own door, but his wife and children,



<P>perceiving it, began to cry after him to return; but the man



<P>put his fingers in his ears, and ran on, crying, Life! life!



<P>eternal life! [Luke 14:26]&nbsp; So he looked not behind him,



<P>but fled towards the middle of the plain.&nbsp; [Gen. 19:17]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{19}



<P>&lt;They that fly from the wrath to come, are a gazing-stock of the

world>



<P>The neighbours also came out to see him run [Jer. 20:10]; and,



<P>as he ran, some mocked, others threatened, and some cried after him



<P>to return; and, among those that did so, there were two that resolved



<P>to fetch him back by force.&nbsp; &lt;Obstinate and Pliable follow him>



<P>The name of the one was Obstinate and the name of the other Pliable.



<P>Now, by this time, the man was got a good distance from them; but,



<P>however, they were resolved to pursue him, which they did,



<P>and in a little time they overtook him.&nbsp; Then said the man, Neighbours,



<P>wherefore are ye come?&nbsp; They said, To persuade you to go back with

us.



<P>But he said, That can by no means be; you dwell, said he,



<P>in the City of Destruction, the place also where I was born:



<P>I see it to be so; and, dying there, sooner or later,



<P>you will sink lower than the grave, into a place that burns



<P>with fire and brimstone:&nbsp; be content, good neighbours,



<P>and go along with me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{20}



<P>OBST.&nbsp; What! said Obstinate, and leave our friends and our comforts



<P>behind us?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, said Christian, for that was his name, because that

ALL



<P>which you shall forsake is not worthy to be compared with a little



<P>of that which I am seeking to enjoy [2 Cor. 4:18]; and,



<P>if you will go along with me, and hold it, you shall fare as I myself;



<P>for there, where I go, is enough and to spare.&nbsp; [Luke 15:17]



<P>Come away, and prove my words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{21}



<P>OBST.&nbsp; What are the things you seek, since you leave all the world



<P>to find them?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I seek an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that



<P>fadeth not away [1 Pet. 1:4], and it is laid up in heaven,



<P>and safe there [Heb. 11:16], to be bestowed, at the time appointed,



<P>on them that diligently seek it.&nbsp; Read it so, if you will, in my

book.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>OBST.&nbsp; Tush! said Obstinate, away with your book; will you



<P>go back with us or no?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; No, not I, said the other, because I have laid my hand



<P>to the plough.&nbsp; [Luke 9:62]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{22}



<P>OBST.&nbsp; Come, then, neighbour Pliable, let us turn again, and go

home



<P>without him; there is a company of these crazy-headed coxcombs, that,



<P>when they take a fancy by the end, are wiser in their own eyes



<P>than seven men that can render a reason.&nbsp; [Prov. 26:16]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PLI.&nbsp; Then said Pliable, Don't revile; if what the good Christian

says



<P>is true, the things he looks after are better than ours:



<P>my heart inclines to go with my neighbour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>OBST.&nbsp; What! more fools still! Be ruled by me, and go back;



<P>who knows whither such a brain-sick fellow will lead you?&nbsp; Go back,



<P>go back, and be wise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{23}



<P>&lt;Christian and Obstinate pull for Pliable's soul>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Nay, but do thou come with thy neighbour, Pliable;



<P>there are such things to be had which I spoke of, and many



<P>more glorious besides.&nbsp; If you believe not me, read here in this

book;



<P>and for the truth of what is expressed therein, behold, all is confirmed



<P>by the blood of Him that made it.&nbsp; [Heb. 9:17-22; 13:20]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PLI.&nbsp; Well, neighbour Obstinate, said Pliable, &lt;Pliable contented

to go



<P>with Christian> I begin to come to a point; I intend to go along



<P>with this good man, and to cast in my lot with him:&nbsp; but,



<P>my good companion, do you know the way to this desired place?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{24}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I am directed by a man, whose name is Evangelist,



<P>to speed me to a little gate that is before us, where we shall receive



<P>instructions about the way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PLI.&nbsp; Come, then, good neighbour, let us be going.&nbsp; Then they

went



<P>both together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>OBST.&nbsp; And I will go back to my place, said Obstinate;



<P>&lt;Obstinate goes railing back> I will be no companion of such misled,



<P>fantastical fellows.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{25}



<P>Now, I saw in my dream, that when Obstinate was gone back,



<P>Christian and Pliable went talking over the plain; and thus they began



<P>their discourse.&nbsp; &lt;Talk between Christian and Pliable>

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{26}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Come, neighbour Pliable, how do you do?&nbsp; I am glad you

are



<P>persuaded to go along with me.&nbsp; Had even Obstinate himself but

felt



<P>what I have felt of the powers and terrors of what is yet unseen,



<P>he would not thus lightly have given us the back.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PLI.&nbsp; Come, neighbour Christian, since there are none but us two

here,



<P>tell me now further what the things are, and how to be enjoyed,



<P>whither we are going.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{27}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I can better conceive of them with my mind, than speak of

them



<P>with my tongue &lt;God's things unspeakable>:&nbsp; but yet, since you

are



<P>desirous to know, I will read of them in my book.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PLI.&nbsp; And do you think that the words of your book are certainly

true?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, verily; for it was made by Him that cannot lie.&nbsp;

[Titus 1:2]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PLI.&nbsp; Well said; what things are they?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; There is an endless kingdom to be inhabited, and everlasting

life



<P>to be given us, that we may inhabit that kingdom for ever.&nbsp; [Isa.

45:17;



<P>John 10:28,29]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PLI.&nbsp; Well said; and what else?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; There are crowns and glory to be given us, and garments



<P>that will make us shine like the sun in the firmament of heaven.



<P>[2 Tim. 4:8; Rev. 3:4; Matt. 13:43]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PLI.&nbsp; This is very pleasant; and what else?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; There shall be no more crying, nor Sorrow:&nbsp; for He that

is



<P>owner of the place will wipe all tears from our eyes.&nbsp; [Isa. 25.6-8;



<P>Rev. 7:17, 21:4]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{28}



<P>PLI.&nbsp; And what company shall we have there?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; There we shall be with seraphims and cherubims,



<P>creatures that will dazzle your eyes to look on them.&nbsp; [Isa. 6:2]



<P>There also you shall meet with thousands and ten thousands



<P>that have gone before us to that place; none of them are hurtful,



<P>but loving and holy; every one walking in the sight of God,



<P>and standing in his presence with acceptance for ever.



<P>[1 Thess. 4:16,17; Rev. 5:11]&nbsp; In a word, there we shall see the

elders



<P>with their golden crowns [Rev. 4:4], there we shall see the holy virgins



<P>with their golden harps [Rev. 14:1-5], there we shall see men



<P>that by the world were cut in pieces, burnt in flames, eaten of beasts,



<P>drowned in the seas, for the love that they bare to the Lord



<P>of the place, all well, and clothed with immortality as with a garment.



<P>[John 12:25; 2 Cor. 5:4]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PLI.&nbsp; The hearing of this is enough to ravish one's heart.



<P>But are these things to be enjoyed?&nbsp; How shall we get to be



<P>sharers thereof?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; The Lord, the Governor of the country, hath recorded that



<P>in this book; the substance of which is, If we be truly willing



<P>to have it, he will bestow it upon us freely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PLI.&nbsp; Well, my good companion, glad am I to hear of these things:



<P>come on, let us mend our pace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I cannot go so fast as I would, by reason of this burden



<P>that is on my back.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{29}



<P>&lt;The Slough of Despond>



<P>Now I saw in my dream, that just as they had ended this talk



<P>they drew near to a very miry slough, that was in the midst



<P>of the plain; and they, being heedless, did both fall suddenly



<P>into the bog.&nbsp; The name of the slough was Despond.&nbsp; Here,

therefore,



<P>they wallowed for a time, being grievously bedaubed with the dirt;



<P>and Christian, because of the burden that was on his back,



<P>began to sink in the mire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{30}



<P>PLI.&nbsp; Then said Pliable; Ah! neighbour Christian, where are you

now?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Truly, said Christian, I do not know.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PLI.&nbsp; At this Pliable began to be offended, and angrily said



<P>to his fellow, Is this the happiness you have told me all this while

of?



<P>If we have such ill speed at our first setting out, what may we expect



<P>betwixt this and our journey's end?&nbsp; May I get out again with my

life,



<P>you shall possess the brave country alone for me.&nbsp; &lt;It is not

enough



<P>to be pliable>&nbsp; And, with that, he gave a desperate struggle or

two,



<P>and got out of the mire on that side of the slough which was next to



<P>his own house:&nbsp; so away he went, and Christian saw him no more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{31}



<P>Wherefore Christian was left to tumble in the Slough of Despond alone:



<P>but still he endeavoured to struggle to that side of the slough



<P>that was still further from his own house, and next to the wicket-gate;



<P>&lt;Christian in trouble seeks still to get further from his own house>



<P>the which he did, but could not get out, because of the burden



<P>that was upon his back:&nbsp; but I beheld in my dream, that a man



<P>came to him, whose name was Help, and asked him, What he did there?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Sir, said Christian, I was bid go this way by a man



<P>called Evangelist, who directed me also to yonder gate,



<P>that I might escape the wrath to come; and as I was going thither



<P>I fell in here.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{32}



<P>&lt;The Promises>



<P>HELP.&nbsp; But why did not you look for the steps?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Fear followed me so hard, that I fled the next way, and fell

in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Help lifts him up>



<P>HELP.&nbsp; Then said he, Give me thy hand:&nbsp; so he gave him his

hand,



<P>and he drew him out, and set him upon sound ground, and bid him



<P>go on his way.&nbsp; [Ps. 40:2]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{33}



<P>Then I stepped to him that plucked him out, and said, Sir, wherefore,



<P>since over this place is the way from the City of Destruction



<P>to yonder gate, is it that this plat is not mended, that poor travellers



<P>might go thither with more security?&nbsp; And he said unto me,



<P>&lt;What makes the Slough of Despond> This miry slough is such a place



<P>as cannot be mended; it is the descent whither the scum and filth



<P>that attends conviction for sin doth continually run, and therefore



<P>it is called the Slough of Despond; for still, as the sinner is awakened



<P>about his lost condition, there ariseth in his soul many fears,



<P>and doubts, and discouraging apprehensions, which all of them



<P>get together, and settle in this place.&nbsp; And this is the reason



<P>of the badness of this ground.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{34}



<P>It is not the pleasure of the King that this place should remain so

bad.



<P>[Isa. 35:3,4]&nbsp; His labourers also have, by the direction of



<P>His Majesty's surveyors, been for above these sixteen hundred years



<P>employed about this patch of ground, if perhaps it might



<P>have been mended:&nbsp; yea, and to my knowledge, said he,



<P>here have been swallowed up at least twenty thousand cart-loads,



<P>yea, millions of wholesome instructions, that have at all seasons



<P>been brought from all places of the King's dominions, and they that



<P>can tell, say they are the best materials to make good ground



<P>of the place; if so be, it might have been mended, but it is



<P>the Slough of Despond still, and so will be when they have done



<P>what they can.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{35}



<P>&lt;The promises of forgiveness and acceptance to life by faith in Christ>



<P>True, there are, by the direction of the Law-giver, certain good and



<P>substantial steps, placed even through the very midst of this slough;



<P>but at such time as this place doth much spew out its filth,



<P>as it doth against change of weather, these steps are hardly seen;



<P>or, if they be, men, through the dizziness of their heads, step beside,



<P>and then they are bemired to purpose, notwithstanding the steps



<P>be there; but the ground is good when they are once got in at the gate.



<P>[1 Sam. 12:23]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{36}



<P>&lt;Pliable got home, and is visited of his neighbours>



<P>Now, I saw in my dream, that by this time Pliable was got home



<P>to his house again, so that his neighbours came to visit him;



<P>&lt;His entertainment by them at his return> and some of them called

him



<P>wise man for coming back, and some called him fool for hazarding himself



<P>with Christian:&nbsp; others again did mock at his cowardliness; saying,



<P>Surely, since you began to venture, I would not have been so base



<P>to have given out for a few difficulties.&nbsp; So Pliable sat sneaking



<P>among them.&nbsp; But at last he got more confidence, and then they

all



<P>turned their tales, and began to deride poor Christian behind his back.



<P>And thus much concerning Pliable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{37}



<P>&lt;Mr. Worldly Wiseman meets with Christian>



<P>Now, as Christian was walking solitarily by himself,



<P>he espied one afar off, come crossing over the field to meet him;



<P>and their hap was to meet just as they were crossing the way of



<P>each other.&nbsp; The gentleman's name that met him was Mr. Worldly

Wiseman,



<P>he dwelt in the town of Carnal Policy, a very great town,



<P>and also hard by from whence Christian came.&nbsp; This man, then,



<P>meeting with Christian, and having some inkling of him,--



<P>for Christian's setting forth from the City of Destruction was



<P>much noised abroad, not only in the town where he dwelt,



<P>but also it began to be the town talk in some other places,--



<P>Mr. Worldly Wiseman, therefore, having some guess of him,



<P>by beholding his laborious going, by observing his sighs and groans,



<P>and the like, began thus to enter into some talk with Christian.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{38}



<P>&lt;Talk betwixt Mr. Worldly Wiseman and Christian>



<P>WORLD.&nbsp; How now, good fellow, whither away after this burdened

manner?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; A burdened manner, indeed, as ever, I think, poor creature

had!



<P>And whereas you ask me, Whither away?&nbsp; I tell you, Sir,



<P>I am going to yonder wicket-gate before me; for there, as I am informed,



<P>I shall be put into a way to be rid of my heavy burden.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>WORLD.&nbsp; Hast thou a wife and children?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes; but I am so laden with this burden that I cannot take



<P>that pleasure in them as formerly; methinks I am as if I had none.



<P>[1 Cor 7:29]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>WORLD.&nbsp; Wilt thou hearken unto me if I give thee counsel?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; If it be good, I will; for I stand in need of good counsel.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{39}



<P>&lt;Mr. Worldly Wiseman's counsel to Christian>



<P>WORLD.&nbsp; I would advise thee, then, that thou with all speed



<P>get thyself rid of thy burden; for thou wilt never be settled



<P>in thy mind till then; nor canst thou enjoy the benefits



<P>of the blessing which God hath bestowed upon thee till then.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; That is that which I seek for, even to be rid of



<P>this heavy burden; but get it off myself, I cannot; nor is there



<P>any man in our country that can take it off my shoulders;



<P>therefore am I going this way, as I told you, that I may be rid of



<P>my burden.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>WORLD.&nbsp; Who bid thee go this way to be rid of thy burden?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; A man that appeared to me to be a very great and



<P>honourable person; his name, as I remember, is Evangelist.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{40}



<P>&lt;Mr. Worldly Wiseman condemned Evangelist's counsel>



<P>WORLD.&nbsp; I beshrew him for his counsel! there is not a more dangerous



<P>and troublesome way in the world than is that unto which he hath



<P>directed thee; and that thou shalt find, if thou wilt be ruled



<P>by his counsel.&nbsp; Thou hast met with something, as I perceive, already;



<P>for I see the dirt of the Slough of Despond is upon thee;



<P>but that slough is the beginning of the sorrows that do attend those



<P>that go on in that way.&nbsp; Hear me, I am older than thou;



<P>thou art like to meet with, in the way which thou goest,



<P>wearisomeness, painfulness, hunger, perils, nakedness, sword, lions,



<P>dragons, darkness, and, in a word, death, and what not!&nbsp; These

things



<P>are certainly true, having been confirmed by many testimonies.



<P>And why should a man so carelessly cast away himself, by giving heed



<P>to a stranger?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;The frame of the heart of a young Christian>



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, Sir, this burden upon my back is more terrible to me



<P>than all these things which you have mentioned; nay, methinks I care

not



<P>what I meet with in the way, if so be I can also meet with deliverance



<P>from my burden.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{41}



<P>&lt;Worldly Wiseman does not like that men should be serious



<P>in reading the Bible>



<P>WORLD.&nbsp; How camest thou by the burden at first?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; By reading this book in my hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>WORLD.&nbsp; I thought so; and it is happened unto thee as to other

weak men,



<P>who, meddling with things too high for them, do suddenly fall



<P>into thy distractions; which distractions do not only unman men,



<P>as thine, I perceive, have done thee, but they run them upon



<P>desperate ventures to obtain they know not what.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I know what I would obtain; it is ease for my heavy burden.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{42}



<P>&lt;Whether Mr. Worldly Wiseman prefers morality before the strait gate>



<P>WORLD.&nbsp; But why wilt thou seek for ease this way, seeing so many

dangers



<P>attend it? especially since, hadst thou but patience to hear me,



<P>I could direct thee to the obtaining of what thou desirest,



<P>without the dangers that thou in this way wilt run thyself into; yea,



<P>and the remedy is at hand.&nbsp; Besides, I will add, that instead of



<P>those dangers, thou shalt meet with much safety, friendship,



<P>and content.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Pray, Sir, open this secret to me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{43}



<P>WORLD.&nbsp; Why, in yonder village--the village is named Morality--



<P>there dwells a gentleman whose name is Legality, a very judicious man,



<P>and a man of very good name, that has skill to help men off



<P>with such burdens as thine are from their shoulders:&nbsp; yea,



<P>to my knowledge, he hath done a great deal of good this way;



<P>ay, and besides, he hath skill to cure those that are somewhat crazed



<P>in their wits with their burdens.&nbsp; To him, as I said, thou mayest

go,



<P>and be helped presently.&nbsp; His house is not quite a mile from this

place,



<P>and if he should not be at home himself, he hath a pretty young man



<P>to his son, whose name is Civility, that can do it (to speak on)



<P>as well as the old gentleman himself; there, I say, thou mayest be



<P>eased of thy burden; and if thou art not minded to go back to



<P>thy former habitation, as, indeed, I would not wish thee,



<P>thou mayest send for thy wife and children to thee to this village,



<P>where there are houses now stand empty, one of which thou mayest have



<P>at reasonable rates; provision is there also cheap and good;



<P>and that which will make thy life the more happy is, to be sure,



<P>there thou shalt live by honest neighbours, in credit and good fashion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{44}



<P>&lt;Christian snared by Worldly Wiseman's words>



<P>Now was Christian somewhat at a stand; but presently he concluded,



<P>if this be true, which this gentleman hath said, my wisest course



<P>is to take his advice; and with that he thus further spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{45}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Sir, which is my way to this honest man's house?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&lt;Mount Sinai>



<P>WORLD.&nbsp; Do you see yonder hill?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, very well.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>WORLD.&nbsp; By that hill you must go, and the first house you come

at



<P>is his.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{46}



<P>&lt;Christian afraid that Mount Sinai would fall on his head>



<P>So Christian turned out of his way to go to Mr. Legality's house



<P>for help; but, behold, when he was got now hard by the hill,



<P>it seemed so high, and also that side of it that was next the wayside



<P>did hang so much over, that Christian was afraid to venture further,



<P>lest the hill should fall on his head; wherefore there he stood still



<P>and wotted not what to do.&nbsp; Also his burden now seemed heavier

to him



<P>than while he was in his way.&nbsp; There came also flashes of fire



<P>out of the hill, that made Christian afraid that he should be burned.



<P>[Ex. 19:16,18]&nbsp; Here, therefore, he sweat and did quake for fear.



<P>[Heb. 12:21]

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Christians unto carnal men give ear,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of their way they go, and pay for 't dear;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Master Worldly Wiseman can but shew



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A saint the way to bondage and to woe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{47}



<P>&lt;Evangelist findeth Christian under Mount Sinai, and looketh severely



<P>upon him>



<P>And now he began to be sorry that he had taken Mr. Worldly Wiseman's



<P>counsel.&nbsp; And with that he saw Evangelist coming to meet him;



<P>at the sight also of whom he began to blush for shame.&nbsp; So Evangelist



<P>drew nearer and nearer; and coming up to him, he looked upon him



<P>with a severe and dreadful countenance, and thus began to reason



<P>with Christian.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{48}



<P>&lt;Evangelist reasons afresh with Christian>



<P>EVAN.&nbsp; What dost thou here, Christian? said he:&nbsp; at which

words



<P>Christian knew not what to answer; wherefore at present he stood



<P>speechless before him.&nbsp; Then said Evangelist further,



<P>Art not thou the man that I found crying without the walls



<P>of the City of Destruction?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, dear Sir, I am the man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>EVAN.&nbsp; Did not I direct thee the way to the little wicket-gate?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Yes, dear Sir, said Christian.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>EVAN.&nbsp; How is it, then, that thou art so quickly turned aside?



<P>for thou art now out of the way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{49}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; I met with a gentleman so soon as I had got over



<P>the Slough of Despond, who persuaded me that I might,



<P>in the village before me, find a man that would take off my burden.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>EVAN.&nbsp; What was he?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; He looked like a gentleman, and talked much to me,



<P>and got me at last to yield; so I came hither; but when I beheld



<P>this hill, and how it hangs over the way, I suddenly made a stand



<P>lest it should fall on my head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>EVAN.&nbsp; What said that gentleman to you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; Why, he asked me whither I was going, and I told him.

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; And what said he then?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>CHR.&nbsp; He asked me if I had a family?&nbsp; And I told him.&nbsp;

But, said I,



<P>I am so loaden with the burden that is on my back, that I cannot



<P>take pleasure in them as formerly.

<P>EVAN.&nbsp; And what said he then?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>{50}



<P>CHR.&nbsp; He bid me with speed get rid of my burden; and I told him



<P>that it was ease that I sought.&nbsp; And said I, I am therefore going



<P>to yonder gate, to receive further direction how I may get to the place



<P>of deliverance.&nbsp; So he said that he would shew me a better way,



<P>and short, not so attended with difficulties as the way, Sir, that you



<P>set me in; which way, said he, will direct you to a gentleman's house



<P>that hath skill to take off these burdens, so I believed him,



<P>and turned out of that way into this, if haply I might be soon eased



<P>of my burden.&nbsp; But when I came to this place, and beheld things



<P>as they are, I stopped for fear (as I said) of danger:



<P>but I now know not what to do.
